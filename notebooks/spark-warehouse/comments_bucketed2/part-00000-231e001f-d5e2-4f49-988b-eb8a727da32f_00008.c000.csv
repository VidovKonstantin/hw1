Why if we have the technology of cloud seeding through laser shooting at particles to create rain and we been manipulating the weather for decades now. Why didn't we redirected or stopped the hurricanes? \\n\\nEven famous physicists Michio Kaku admits to this geoengenering on a cbs news interview.  \\nI wish it didn't happen and all natural disasters are a horrible thing for anyone to endure. And my heart goes out to all the victims and will continue to support. But it is so sad to find out that tragic events like this can be man made at times. So I pray that many of you become aware of what's really taking place in this reality and give your life to God, he won't disappoint you. \\nAnd I pray that this whole event about helping is not just an agenda to promote and push coexistence, globalism and unity. Their religion of occult  New Age/mysticism and rise of their Antichrist/alien god to bring their New World Order, which they believe, chaos must be created in order to bring Order. Where with their mind witch powers and advance alien/demon technology they can create  almost anything they can imagine. \\nDon't get me wrong please, helping is awesome as I'm praying for everyone including the celebrities participating and even those who have sold their souls for riches and fame, is not to late for redemption! I'm praying for you. But really hope this is not all orchestrated for a different agenda, don't forget that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. Time to read our Bibles and take a close look at  the book of Revelation chapter 13,  Daniel 12 and Luke 21.\\nStay strong Texas, Florida, all the Caribbean and to all those affected. May you find peace and joy in Christ Jesus even in the middle of the struggles. Remember man and Satan  can only hurt the physical body or the material but can't never have our souls if we believe we are Gods children and the only way to be redeemed and adopted into Gods family is by Jesus Christ our Savior, there's no short cuts and Satan is a liar so don't fall for the lies because religion kills and condemns the soul, only a true relationship with Father God through Jesus saves.

Parcellls always said he's smart. But many could not see that. Well, now anyone who appreciates smart football will see for themselves. Here's the downside: now I probably need to get GameRewind because he's calling games in the AFC and I think it's brilliant the way he anticipates the action, so if I wanna see that I'll have to pay for it.

c3pFWJCQy5E,"chemo is mustard gas and was created by the Nazi's.  It's got a very low survival rate in 5 years, only about 9%.  There are holistic methods that have a much higher survival rate.  The medical industry does not want you to find out about natural therapies, b/c it's all about profits for them.  Look up the youtube video channel Chris Beat Cancer and find out the truth. Most doctors would not do chemo. If you look up info on youtube you will find that people cure cancer holistically. All cancers are due to toxins in the body.  The mainstream medical system is clueless. You need a naturapathic M.D. that can do vitamin B17 and Vitamin C IVs.  Chemo is a toxic poison and you can't get rid of toxins in the body with another toxin. Ask your doctors what the cause of cancer is, they do not know.  But, naturapathic M.D.s do lab testing and know the cause of cancer is toxins.  Look at your food labels and wonder why there are chemicals in foods, where do you think that goes when you eat it.  There is a reason why the food and drug admin are working together.  Profits from poisoning the population, is big bucks.  You can get rid of cancer by detoxification using herb, essential oils, juice fasting etc. A Naturapthic doctor can help you. Look up Dr. Robert Morse on youtube.",0,0
c3pFWJCQy5E,I'm glad you're doing ok. However I just wanted to mention that chemotherapy does not work. 97% of the time patients taking chemotherapy do not get better and they relapse. When a person has chemo inside their body they are killing all good living cells including healthy probiotics and bacteria that keep you functioning and that promote good digestion and other things. Chemotherapy is literally putting chemicals inside of your body to try and kill cancerous cells. If you want to read more about chemotherapy and the messed up medical industry I would really recommend you read The MD Emperor has no Clothes By Dr. Peter Glidden.,0,0

Many of them are worth multiple 100's of millions.   How much of their extra money did they give?  Too many of them had to make their political agendas heard where there was no need in this sort of event.  This is one of the major reasons they could only raise $44 million while having exposure on multiple networks.   To put this in perspective the Jerry Lewis Telethon in 1990 raised $44 million (1990 dollars) and had much less exposure.

Here's the downside: now I probably need to get GameRewind because he's calling games in the AFC and I think it's brilliant the way he anticipates the action, so if I wanna see that I'll have to pay for it.

4MkC65emkG4,Collectively these entertainers have a net worth in the multiple billions and maybe as high as $15 billion.  Oprah alone is worth $3 billion.  Many of them are worth multiple 100's of millions.   How much of their extra money did they give?  Too many of them had to make their political agendas heard where there was no need in this sort of event.  This is one of the major reasons they could only raise $44 million while having exposure on multiple networks.   To put this in perspective the Jerry Lewis Telethon in 1990 raised $44 million (1990 dollars) and had much less exposure.   Most people were turned off and would rather donate through other avenues.,1,0

4MkC65emkG4,"Cam den, here is the answer: These Entertainment People have been playing a big role in bringing these disasters upon us, like hurricanes, tornados, floods, fires, and so on. These people have been paralyzing us by drugs, alcohol, on their TV, and movies with all kinds of sex and music to the point that our people are not able to think anymore, and they do not know who created them from ejected semen, just read those posts. These are the people who made us a Godless nation. Another reason for these disasters are those illiterate preachers who have been raping our hearts and souls with fake information for just a few $. You Have All The Rights to Deny, and Reject All of These Existing Fake and False Religions! But, now we have the Scientifically Proven Scripture based on Mathematics the Exact Science, which tells you the truth about our Creator, but again this same media have been trying so hard to hide it from our people ever since 40 years ago. It says if you DO NOT thank your Creator every day for the roof over your head, for your jobs in order to get His provisions, for your health, protections, and happiness, and if you do not pay 10% of your earnings to the needy relatives, fatherless children, and homeless people, then DO NOT expect any protection from your Creator, although He has given us enough respites.

I do pray for the victims of Irma and Harvey and I appreciate the work the heroes, celebs and communities are doing to help them. For all those haters out there who think its silly for rich celebs to ask others for money, clearly you don't get how it works. Billions of dollars in damages is what people are facing. You seriously expect the celebs to all empty their accounts. No. They will give what they can: probably a million or two but even more because of who they are they can raise so much more. How many ppl would want to have a chat with George Clooney or Justin Bieber or OPRAH (not Orcca or Opera. Ridiculous). The answer is thousands if not millions. If these thousands each donate $10 that's at least $10,000 that can go a long way. Celebs are very influential, whether you like it or not. One message from Queen Bey or Nicole Kidman or JT and you're diving for the phone. I'm all the way in Africa making peanuts and I wanted to donate. Still wish I could.

unIkqhB2nA0,"I noticed his wiping his face, and assumed it was for that reason, to reduce any false negatives (they mentioned how they have worked to prevent spoofing with photos or masks, as has been shown with the Samsung phones). That said, it is clear from the screen that Face ID is off (your passcode is required to enable FaceID), meaning someone accidentally turned it off beforehand, it is the message you currently get from TouchID when security has turned it off for any number of reasons, be it 3 failed authentications (eg setup assistants getting scanned 3 times), a restart as mentioned, or it being turned off accidentally in setup by pressing buttons on either side, a feature designed to quickly turn it off, eg if you hand your phone to someone to hold, or someone demands your phone (US law protects your right not to reveal passcodes, not biometrics). Whether the setup failure was Craig's or an assistant's fault, who knows, but I expect people's fear of it will dissipate as the fear over TouchID did, or any number of scary new technology before it involving security like biometrics. Craig's letter on The Verge said The bio-lockout that I experienced on stage would require several interactions by other people with your phone (where they woke up the phone). Of course, it could be a Beta bug, I'm sure they have gone over everything that happened with the phone prior to the event, to track down the source of the failure. Either way, it is a storm in a teacup. All the tech site videos I've seen from people there, it worked flawlessly without holding the phone up unnaturally or having to open your eyes like you mockingly did in this video. According to Federighi, it should even work with most sunglasses. I'm sure people will test the hell out of it when it comes out, like people did TouchID, and they will sell boatloads, even at that price.",0,0

4MkC65emkG4,Collectively these entertainers have a net worth in the multiple billions and maybe as high as $15 billion.  Oprah alone is worth $3 billion.  Many of them are worth multiple 100's of millions.   How much of their extra money did they give?  Too many of them had to make their political agendas heard where there was no need in this sort of event.  This is one of the major reasons they could only raise $44 million while having exposure on multiple networks.   To put this in perspective the Jerry Lewis Telethon in 1990 raised $44 million (1990 dollars) and had much less exposure.   Most people were turned off and would rather donate through other avenues.,1,0

These people have been paralyzing us by drugs, alcohol, on their TV, and movies with all kinds of sex and music to the point that our people are not able to think anymore, and they do not know who created them from ejected semen, just read those posts. These are the people who made us a Godless nation. Another reason for these disasters are those illiterate preachers who have been raping our hearts and souls with fake information for just a few $. You Have All The Rights to Deny, and Reject All of These Existing Fake and False Religions! But, now we have the Scientifically Proven Scripture based on Mathematics the Exact Science, which tells you the truth about our Creator, but again this same media have been trying so hard to hide it from our people ever since 40 years ago. It says if you DO NOT thank your Creator every day for the roof over your head, for your jobs in order to get His provisions, for your health, protections, and happiness, and if you do not pay 10% of your earnings to the needy relatives, fatherless children, and homeless people, then DO NOT expect any protection from your Creator, although He has given us enough respites.

I do pray for the victims of Irma and Harvey and I appreciate the work the heroes, celebs and communities are doing to help them. For all those haters out there who think its silly for rich celebs to ask others for money, clearly you don't get how it works. Billions of dollars in damages is what people are facing. You seriously expect the celebs to all empty their accounts. No. They will give what they can: probably a million or two but even more because of who they are they can raise so much more. How many ppl would want to have a chat with George Clooney or Justin Bieber or OPRAH (not Orcca or Opera. Ridiculous). The answer is thousands if not millions. If these thousands each donate $10 that's at least $10,000 that can go a long way. Celebs are very influential, whether you like it or not. One message from Queen Bey or Nicole Kidman or JT and you're diving for the phone. I'm all the way in Africa making peanuts and I wanted to donate. Still wish I could.

unIkqhB2nA0,I have an Android released in late 2016 and it has face unlock that never fails and a fingerprint and passcode at the same time. This is not new technology.,0,0
unIkqhB2nA0,"It looks as though the phone was either restarted or had someone other than the presenter trying to unlock it. It didn't say try again like when touch id fails it said please enter passcode to enable face IdI don't think it failed, even as a skeptic.

unIkqhB2nA0,he had to enable it cause it just TURNED ON,0,0
unIkqhB2nA0,"I noticed his wiping his face, and assumed it was for that reason, to reduce any false negatives (they mentioned how they have worked to prevent spoofing with photos or masks, as has been shown with the Samsung phones). That said, it is clear from the screen that Face ID is off (your passcode is required to enable FaceID), meaning someone accidentally turned it off beforehand, it is the message you currently get from TouchID when security has turned it off for any number of reasons, be it 3 failed authentications (eg setup assistants getting scanned 3 times), a restart as mentioned, or it being turned off accidentally in setup by pressing buttons on either side, a feature designed to quickly turn it off, eg if you hand your phone to someone to hold, or someone demands your phone (US law protects your right not to reveal passcodes, not biometrics). Whether the setup failure was Craig's or an assistant's fault, who knows, but I expect people's fear of it will dissipate as the fear over TouchID did, or any number of scary new technology before it involving security like biometrics. Craig's letter on The Verge said The bio-lockout that I experienced on stage would require several interactions by other people with your phone (where they woke up the phone). Of course, it could be a Beta bug, I'm sure they have gone over everything that happened with the phone prior to the event, to track down the source of the failure. Either way, it is a storm in a teacup. All the tech site videos I've seen from people there, it worked flawlessly without holding the phone up unnaturally or having to open your eyes like you mockingly did in this video. According to Federighi, it should even work with most sunglasses. I'm sure people will test the hell out of it when it comes out, like people did TouchID, and they will sell boatloads, even at that price.",0,0
unIkqhB2nA0,"People who wear makeup will only be able to use this feature half the time, anyway.",0,0
unIkqhB2nA0,I wouldn‚Äôt buy it anyway. This failure only makes me laugh. It‚Äôs like Samsung‚Äôs stupid fingerprint scanner placement. Only to Samsung you can accustom and in case of iPhone x you will accustom to entering password.,0,0
unIkqhB2nA0,The first iphone x was functioning properly and hence to enable touch id or face id we require passcode at first attempt so as iphone x did\nThe person took another iphone x as u can see and the face id was working properly,0,0
unIkqhB2nA0,This is a joke. That happened in the presentation once. Let the phone come out and the try for yourself and see if it's gonna work or not. Jesus so much drama over this. I didn't see all these drama queens acting up when Samsung blowing up everywhere.,0,0
unIkqhB2nA0,this is dumb because this just proves that Apple is backpeddling on their own stance with their San Bernadino case !,0,0
unIkqhB2nA0,The issue was it had security locked itself bc so many ppl had handled it. It was a fail safe the facial recognition software was just fine,0,0

unIkqhB2nA0,I guess you weren't told their reason for the unlock fail from Apple? The phone was handled by others prior to the event and it locked anyone but him out prior to the code. Which in their defense is a either a smart come back proving the security is great or poor planning by allowing someone else to play with his phone at the wrong time. Lol. Peace. I'm not saying it's facts. Just what apple has claimed.,0,1

These people have been paralyzing us by drugs, alcohol, on their TV, and movies with all kinds of sex and music to the point that our people are not able to think anymore, and they do not know who created them from ejected semen, just read those posts. These are the people who made us a Godless nation. Another reason for these disasters are those illiterate preachers who have been raping our hearts and souls with fake information for just a few $. You Have All The Rights to Deny, and Reject All of These Existing Fake and False Religions! But, now we have the Scientifically Proven Scripture based on Mathematics the Exact Science, which tells you the truth about our Creator, but again this same media have been trying so hard to hide it from our people ever since 40 years ago. It says if you DO NOT thank your Creator every day for the roof over your head, for your jobs in order to get His provisions, for your health, protections, and happiness, and if you do not pay 10% of your earnings to the needy relatives, fatherless children, and homeless people, then DO NOT expect any protection from your Creator, although He has given us enough respites.

4MkC65emkG4,Collectively these entertainers have a net worth in the multiple billions and maybe as high as $15 billion.  Oprah alone is worth $3 billion.  Many of them are worth multiple 100's of millions.   How much of their extra money did they give?  Too many of them had to make their political agendas heard where there was no need in this sort of event.  This is one of the major reasons they could only raise $44 million while having exposure on multiple networks.   To put this in perspective the Jerry Lewis Telethon in 1990 raised $44 million (1990 dollars) and had much less exposure.   Most people were turned off and would rather donate through other avenues.,1,0

For all those haters out there who think its silly for rich celebs to ask others for money, clearly you don't get how it works. Billions of dollars in damages is what people are facing. You seriously expect the celebs to all empty their accounts. No. They will give what they can: probably a million or two but even more because of who they are they can raise so much more. How many ppl would want to have a chat with George Clooney or Justin Bieber or OPRAH (not Orcca or Opera. Ridiculous). The answer is thousands if not millions. If these thousands each donate $10 that's at least $10,000 that can go a long way. Celebs are very influential, whether you like it or not. One message from Queen Bey or Nicole Kidman or JT and you're diving for the phone. I'm all the way in Africa making peanuts and I wanted to donate. Still wish I could.

To sum up, in advertisements everything looks good, if you are dump you buy everything, if you are not, you think what you already have, and if those extra features worth 1000+ euros.",0,0

unIkqhB2nA0,"Well touch ID will do the same thing, after a reboot and initial unlock. So touch ID, does not quite work the way most would think and unlock the phone simply by touching your finger to the phone. So I see no reason why, one would assume that facial recognition would do something that touch ID does not do after a reboot and initial unlock. As for his wiping his face in things, actually that is probably a nervous reaction to say OK is this backup going to be working as intended. As I have done the same thing, when giving a power point presentation as the pressure is on.

Just like when you don't use your iPhone for a while or you restart it you need to enter your digital passcode.

These are the people who made us a Godless nation. Another reason for these disasters are those illiterate preachers who have been raping our hearts and souls with fake information for just a few $. You Have All The Rights to Deny, and Reject All of These Existing Fake and False Religions! But, now we have the Scientifically Proven Scripture based on Mathematics the Exact Science, which tells you the truth about our Creator, but again this same media have been trying so hard to hide it from our people ever since 40 years ago. It says if you DO NOT thank your Creator every day for the roof over your head, for your jobs in order to get His provisions, for your health, protections, and happiness, and if you do not pay 10% of your earnings to the needy relatives, fatherless children, and homeless people, then DO NOT expect any protection from your Creator, although He has given us enough respites.

4MkC65emkG4,Collectively these entertainers have a net worth in the multiple billions and maybe as high as $15 billion.  Oprah alone is worth $3 billion.  Many of them are worth multiple 100's of millions.   How much of their extra money did they give?  Too many of them had to make their political agendas heard where there was no need in this sort of event.  This is one of the major reasons they could only raise $44 million while having exposure on multiple networks.

4MkC65emkG4,"Cam den & ReligionwhistleBlower, Here is how media and entertainment society brainwashed us. They have been showing us that it is ok to go all around the world to those poor countries and kill millions of their innocent people and take away their natural resources. They have been showing us that it is ok to kill 10 million Native Americans together with their buffalos. They have been showing us that black lives don‚Äôt matter. They showed us that it is ok to throw atomic bomb and kill innocent people. They took away the name of our Creator from the face of our nation and they let those illiterate preachers who worship idols mislead us, that is why the Angeles of the Almighty, the drives of the wind bring down 1900 tornados upon them every year plus floods, fires, and hurricanes, and mudslides. Our media have been showing us that fast foods are good for us, yet every year people are dying of cancers and many other diseases instead of a normal death. They have been showing us that chemical fertilizers are good, and they say spray your food with chemical poisons it is good for you. Our media have been showing us that polluting the air is ok and we don‚Äôt get lung cancer because of that. They have been promoting cigarettes; alcohol and gambling in order for us to die of lung cancers, accidents, family problems, and divorces. They have been promoting all kinds of sex, adulteries and homosexuality in order for us to get different diseases and aid killing 49 million so far. They have been showing us that killing our own people it is ok, that is how they have been promoting guns for all. They have been showing us that white color crimes are ok, that is why they do not charge those highly educated criminals. Everything our media have taught us is against the laws of our creator. You are right they have been hiding the awesome message of our creator based on mathematics ever since 40 some years ago. The crimes that media have committed are far greater than all of those criminals from the beginning of time combined. Leaving the system of our creator only brings down suffering and disasters upon us. Therefore, when the Almighty sends His next disaster just make sure that is the consequence of our own wrong doings, so do not complain. His law is, ‚ÄúNothing happens to you if you follow the rules of our Creator‚Äù.",0,0

I do pray for the victims of Irma and Harvey and I appreciate the work the heroes, celebs and communities are doing to help them. For all those haters out there who think its silly for rich celebs to ask others for money, clearly you don't get how it works. Billions of dollars in damages is what people are facing. You seriously expect the celebs to all empty their accounts. No. They will give what they can: probably a million or two but even more because of who they are they can raise so much more. How many ppl would want to have a chat with George Clooney or Justin Bieber or OPRAH (not Orcca or Opera. Ridiculous). The answer is thousands if not millions. If these thousands each donate $10 that's at least $10,000 that can go a long way. Celebs are very influential, whether you like it or not. One message from Queen Bey or Nicole Kidman or JT and you're diving for the phone. I'm all the way in Africa making peanuts and I wanted to donate. Still wish I could. So get over the hate, hold someone's hand and help how you can. If you can't do that well God help you.",0,0

unIkqhB2nA0,Please like if you agree.  The problem in today's market is that the market is no longer controlled by us the consumer and we are now forced to eat whatever bullshit thing Apple OR Samsung throws down our throats.  Apple takes things away ie the headphone jack and touch ID forcing you to either do something you don't want to do or buy something you don't want to NEED to buy while upping the price every year and providing minimal increases.  and Samsung keeps adding more and more bloatware and tracking bullshit to your phone while providing barely any improvement to battery size or anything else useful.  Why did we need bixby AND google now?   What about those of us that didn't use either and now there are 2 programs that do the same thing draining battery that you cannot uninstall or disable.  What's the solution?  I don't know I think it's possible we have slipped too far down the rabbit hole.,0,0

Very possibly the Iphone will ''learn'' a users face after a few days, just like the function on Galaxy s7/8 where you can retrain the face detection, but at start it fails to register the user. \\n\\nThere's a high chance that the Iphone demos were set to presenters face, charged up and left for use on stage. Because he didn't walk around with it, use it as his own phone, it essentially didn't know him, and this is why he had to reach for backup.

unIkqhB2nA0,Ho ho ho... ppl now support apple by saying that the phone was restarted & thats why passcode was required\n.. so why the hell in second attempt it worked..... it was a flop show brodaaaas.

unIkqhB2nA0,Does anyone realise that the Samsung 4s has face recognition to open your phone?,0,0

unIkqhB2nA0,"Lou, that is not what happened. The people responsible for setting up the demo iPhone area were handling the phone and since the display was on, Face ID was trying to authenticate them.

unIkqhB2nA0,"Sometimes you press your finger on the home button and it doesn't read your finger print , why does no one make a huge deal ab it??

unIkqhB2nA0,"Yes, this was one of the reasons I am giving up my iPhone (have a 7 plus not upgrading like I thought to the iPhone X). I ordered the Note 8 after the keynote. The Note was half the price (Samsung discount until Sept 30th and came with a 360 camera, how could I say no). I do like the bigger screen, for some reason I thought the iPhone X would be offered in a larger plus screen, not sure why I thought that, read somewhere they may offer a 6.5 screen, I was all over that. The Note also has a better camera (1.7 aperture vs iPhone 1.8) and other reasons. I really wanted that iPhone X, but it's just not enough to keep me right now. Perhaps next year they will win me back, the face detection was the straw that broke it finally for me. I don't want to use face detection holding the phone at odd not natural places, same of how I feel with Iris detection, its just not natural, although Iris detection worked every time I tried it, surprised low light worked so well, that said I prefer the easy fingerprint. That's just me.",1,0
unIkqhB2nA0,Don't be dumb don't buy a apple ispy phone X .,1,0
unIkqhB2nA0,I only use normal 4 digit passcode I tried Touch ID for a little while but it never worked properly I always had to wipe my thumb or the home button to get it working I imagine there will be similar problems with the face recognition if him wiping his face was actually why it suddenly worked I can just imagine someone trying to unlock there phone after a workout or people with jobs where they get anything on there face such as mud dust or likewise and if you actually just stop and thing about it what is it actually you get extra taking into account the massive price difference from the iPhone 7 to the 8 or from the 8 to the X personally I have the old 6 plus and I really can't see why I would use hundreds of dollars on a new phone that doesn't even have that much more to offer than my current phone I plan on keeping this phone for at least 5 more years and unless apple bring back the god damm headphone jack then I'll probably get a phone from one plus given they are so much cheaper,1,0
unIkqhB2nA0,It happened because the people handling the phone before where accidentally triggering face id when handling the phone therefore the phone for security reasons blocked the facial recognition and required a password therefore doing its job,1,0

4MkC65emkG4,"Cam den & ReligionwhistleBlower, Here is how media and entertainment society brainwashed us. They have been showing us that it is ok to go all around the world to those poor countries and kill millions of their innocent people and take away their natural resources. They have been showing us that it is ok to kill 10 million Native Americans together with their buffalos. They have been showing us that black lives don‚Äôt matter. They showed us that it is ok to throw atomic bomb and kill innocent people. They took away the name of our Creator from the face of our nation and they let those illiterate preachers who worship idols mislead us, that is why the Angeles of the Almighty, the drives of the wind bring down 1900 tornados upon them every year plus floods, fires, and hurricanes, and mudslides. Our media have been showing us that fast foods are good for us, yet every year people are dying of cancers and many other diseases instead of a normal death. They have been showing us that chemical fertilizers are good, and they say spray your food with chemical poisons it is good for you. Our media have been showing us that polluting the air is ok and we don‚Äôt get lung cancer because of that. They have been promoting cigarettes; alcohol and gambling in order for us to die of lung cancers, accidents, family problems, and divorces. They have been promoting all kinds of sex, adulteries and homosexuality in order for us to get different diseases and aid killing 49 million so far. They have been showing us that killing our own people it is ok, that is how they have been promoting guns for all. They have been showing us that white color crimes are ok, that is why they do not charge those highly educated criminals. Everything our media have taught us is against the laws of our creator. You are right they have been hiding the awesome message of our creator based on mathematics ever since 40 some years ago. The crimes that media have committed are far greater than all of those criminals from the beginning of time combined. Leaving the system of our creator only brings down suffering and disasters upon us. Therefore, when the Almighty sends His next disaster just make sure that is the consequence of our own wrong doings, so do not complain. His law is, ‚ÄúNothing happens to you if you follow the rules of our Creator‚Äù.",0,0

4MkC65emkG4,Collectively these entertainers have a net worth in the multiple billions and maybe as high as $15 billion.  Oprah alone is worth $3 billion.  Many of them are worth multiple 100's of millions.   How much of their extra money did they give?  Too many of them had to make their political agendas heard where there was no need in this sort of event.  This is one of the major reasons they could only raise $44 million while having exposure on multiple networks.   To put this in perspective the Jerry Lewis Telethon in 1990 raised $44 million (1990 dollars) and had much less exposure.

It says if you DO NOT thank your Creator every day for the roof over your head, for your jobs in order to get His provisions, for your health, protections, and happiness, and if you do not pay 10% of your earnings to the needy relatives, fatherless children, and homeless people, then DO NOT expect any protection from your Creator, although He has given us enough respites.

How many ppl would want to have a chat with George Clooney or Justin Bieber or OPRAH (not Orcca or Opera. Ridiculous). The answer is thousands if not millions. If these thousands each donate $10 that's at least $10,000 that can go a long way. Celebs are very influential, whether you like it or not. One message from Queen Bey or Nicole Kidman or JT and you're diving for the phone. I'm all the way in Africa making peanuts and I wanted to donate. Still wish I could.

4MkC65emkG4,"It was a nice gesture all these celebrities seemingly showing REAL concern for victims of ALL these tragedies but let's GET REAL FOR MINUTE. By the show's end Billy Crystal said that had raised 14 million 500 thousand something. First, there were more than 14 celebrities participating in the show and let's just say each of them donated a million of their millions or billions ( P. Diddy ALONE COULD OF DONATED 20 MILLION WITHOUT FLINCHING, SAME FOR JULIA ROBERTS,GEORGE CLOONEY,ADAM SANDLER) then HELLO they would have had WAY MORE than 14 million in an hour!!!And 2,  I am a disabled single parent who is in school FULL TIME with poverty level income and still have already amassed 2 truckfuls of donations of ALL KINDS. Money,food,blankets,clothes (for every member of a family), toys, toiletries etc.and sent it to further south (I'M IN FLORIDA)because I don't even have a decent vehicle to take it myself! IT'S RIDICULOUS! THE RICHEST 1% asking the other 99% for help! WE ALREADY ARE!! REALLY?!!!

What you are doing is beautiful. Thank you for sharing all of this with us! I also travel a lot for work, so I know how it feels. You feel guilty for stressing over problems that don't seem like a big deal, but it's not anyone else's place to judge how something should or shouldn't make you feel. Your feelings are YOUR feelings and it's what makes you human! It's also what makes you an incredible vlogger because you care about your audience and the content you are releasing. I think it's good that you open up your heart and get these things off your chest. Some people won't understand, but that's okay. You will never be able to please everyone! You say it to us at the end of each video, but don't forget that YOU are beautiful. YOU are one of a kind. And YOU make millions of people smile more each and every day.

You need to do what you are happy with. If it's your project put whatever the fluff you want in it lol. As for the vlogs we would all miss you if you took a break but if that'll help just know your supporters will be here whenever you'd return. Your doing wonderful things for so many ppl so just remember that. Your human and sometimes you just have to step back and asses things, figure things out. Chat with Brit & the boys about how to make it better and easier on all of you. At the end of the day you'll always have fans that support you and your family is always there. So just take a minute to think about what's the best option right now and go from there. Sending lots of love from our family straight to yours. Xoxo \\nCheers",0,0

RIGgn1s3AvI,"What I really love about Bjork other than her indubitable musical genius , is her collaboration with young people in the creative industry. She has worked with McQueen way before Gaga, then Iris Van Herpen, then Michele. Musical wise, she has worked with some of the most creative and equally eccentric people in the industry from the 90s til now, too many to name. Visually, I think she has helped sealed the genius in directors like Michel Gondry, Spike Jonze, Chris Cunningham, Stephane Sednaoui ...and now Andrew Huang. She doesn't live in her own world; she inspires each generation and brings out the best in these young people. I think this is what an industry should be - a collaboration transcending generations that learn from and grow with each other.",0,0

RIGgn1s3AvI,"+Arca 1000000 +Bj√∂rk Healing from addiction takes time. Making up your mind to stop using drugs is a big step. Being addicted makes you afraid of what will happen if you don't keep taking the drug. People often won't try quitting until they're forced to, because it seems too hard.When you stop using the drug, it upsets your body and brain. You might feel very sick for a while, and feel a very strong need to take the drug. It can be really hard to refuse to use the drug when you feel that bad.But you don't have to do it alone. Support groups, treatment programs, and sometimes medicines can help. You'll meet people who understand what you're going through, who can give you advice and cheer you on. Counselors can help you find medicines that make you feel less sick and reduce your cravings to use the drug. They can also teach you how to cope with problems without using drugs.After you've stopped using the drug, you still have a lot to do:You have to relearn how to live without using drugs. You have to work on the problems your drug use caused with your family, your job, your friends, and your money. You have to stay away from people you used drugs with and places where you used. You have to learn what makes you want to take drugs again, so you can avoid or work on those things. You may also need treatment for problems that led to your drug use, such as depression, anxiety, or other mental health problems.A trigger is anything that makes a person feel the urge to go back to using drugs. It can be a place, person, thing, smell, feeling, or memory that reminds the person of taking a drug and getting high. A trigger can be something stressful that you want to escape from. It can even be something that makes you feel happy. People fighting addiction need to stay away from the triggers that can make them start using drugs again.",0,0

nivfxoep6Rs,I don't understand why everyone is hating on Roman. Give him a break. Alot of stress can really mess with you. Yeah people have bigger problems but it's hard. He doesn't want millions of people mad at him for not uploading like usual. Cut it out. I hope Roman understands that his real fans don't care about how long the vlogs are. I know I don't.

You need to do what you are happy with. If it's your project put whatever the fluff you want in it lol. As for the vlogs we would all miss you if you took a break but if that'll help just know your supporters will be here whenever you'd return. Your doing wonderful things for so many ppl so just remember that. Your human and sometimes you just have to step back and asses things, figure things out. Chat with Brit & the boys about how to make it better and easier on all of you. At the end of the day you'll always have fans that support you and your family is always there. So just take a minute to think about what's the best option right now and go from there. Sending lots of love from our family straight to yours. Xoxo \\nCheers",0,0

RIGgn1s3AvI,"What I really love about Bjork other than her indubitable musical genius , is her collaboration with young people in the creative industry. She has worked with McQueen way before Gaga, then Iris Van Herpen, then Michele. Musical wise, she has worked with some of the most creative and equally eccentric people in the industry from the 90s til now, too many to name. Visually, I think she has helped sealed the genius in directors like Michel Gondry, Spike Jonze, Chris Cunningham, Stephane Sednaoui ...and now Andrew Huang. She doesn't live in her own world; she inspires each generation and brings out the best in these young people. I think this is what an industry should be - a collaboration transcending generations that learn from and grow with each other.",2,0

nivfxoep6Rs,"It makes me sad to know ppl get upset that you leave you family. You're doing big things and ppl definitely need to remember that. Me and my boys watch your videos almost every school night just before bed. They look up to you and rightfully so. I admire your dedication to your family and respect your Drive. You need to do what you are happy with. If it's your project put whatever the fluff you want in it lol. As for the vlogs we would all miss you if you took a break but if that'll help just know your supporters will be here whenever you'd return. Your doing wonderful things for so many ppl so just remember that. Your human and sometimes you just have to step back and asses things, figure things out. Chat with Brit & the boys about how to make it better and easier on all of you. At the end of the day you'll always have fans that support you and your family is always there. So just take a minute to think about what's the best option right now and go from there. Sending lots of love from our family straight to yours. Xoxo \\nCheers",0,0

1kHmFjHzR-s,I love Victoria. I think she is such a classy lady but I struggle to find her personality. On interviews she is constantly talking about David or her kids but very little about herself. In this interview she was asked about her favourite music but she replied with what her kids listened to and went on blabbering about it. I know she loves her kids like every mom does but I wish she opened up more about herself rather than talking about David and kids all the time. It makes her look like her only achievement till now is she married a famous guy and had kids with him.,9,0

I was 19 when I read it and it was the first time I'd ever seen a protagonist nearly defeated by my old enemy, stairs.

H3YE_oGD05M,"Daiya cheese is un-naturally flavored 59% saturated fat garbage, the manufacturing facility everyone has to wear hazmat like jumpers, boots, nets, full face respirators. Not for sanitary but for the toxic fumes mixing those flavors. Why and how? Because I live near it, I went to culinary school, I have worked in organic and natural food manufacturing of way to many foods and companies using even organic flavors, Oh man, don't believe any of that crap. You'll never find out, the bosses will even tell you not to sample flavored items that are vegan, teas, to foods or what have you. Sorry but Daiya doesn't sit right in my body or any of my vegan friends in Vancouver. Stick to nutritional cheese or Chao cheese. Ethics and manipulation is a flaw in natural foods. I see foods in stores that are expired and were once moldy and are passed as organic. Even in multi-national or International franchises, to amazon to major grocery chains.\\n\\nI have yet to meet one ethical and transparent organic company In the west coast of Canada. They are slave owners and like to say everything is organic and have paid off health inspector informants. Shall I retrieve my emails after great concerns and complaints of many employees I have worked with. Never trust any food manufacturer. Unless you see how it is made, we are blind to this yes. But stay as natural as possible, open kitchen restaurants and farm markets. I rather spend more and help smaller folks out then greedy corrupt families or elitist companies only for corrupt greed. The stories I could tell you folks over the last 5 years working with making natural and organic foods.",6,1

H3YE_oGD05M,"I like your recipies, i¬¥d love to try the vegan nacho cheese, on the other hand, i would like you to know some things becuase those are not mexican dishes, those are TEXMEX. We dont use yellow cheese, we dont even eat nachos (as a mexican dish), for us nachos are an American thing, adding beans is also a Mexican stereotype. Pico de Gallo uses Serrano pepper, not Jalape√±o, but thats ok. \\n\\nThe way we eat tortilla chips is just with smashed beans with queso fresco, or in a soup.\\n\\nMost of the time our quesadillas uses Oaxaca cheese or quesillo, that is white. \\n\\nThats all, hehe... thanks for posting this video, and being aware of the last eartquake, we apreciate it.",2,0

H3YE_oGD05M,"Daiya cheese is un-naturally flavored 59% saturated fat garbage, the manufacturing facility everyone has to wear hazmat like jumpers, boots, nets, full face respirators. Not for sanitary but for the toxic fumes mixing those flavors. Why and how? Because I live near it, I went to culinary school, I have worked in organic and natural food manufacturing of way to many foods and companies using even organic flavors, Oh man, don't believe any of that crap. You'll never find out, the bosses will even tell you not to sample flavored items that are vegan, teas, to foods or what have you. Sorry but Daiya doesn't sit right in my body or any of my vegan friends in Vancouver. Stick to nutritional cheese or Chao cheese. Ethics and manipulation is a flaw in natural foods. I see foods in stores that are expired and were once moldy and are passed as organic. Even in multi-national or International franchises, to amazon to major grocery chains.\\n\\nI have yet to meet one ethical and transparent organic company In the west coast of Canada. They are slave owners and like to say everything is organic and have paid off health inspector informants. Shall I retrieve my emails after great concerns and complaints of many employees I have worked with. Never trust any food manufacturer. Unless you see how it is made, we are blind to this yes. But stay as natural as possible, open kitchen restaurants and farm markets. I rather spend more and help smaller folks out then greedy corrupt families or elitist companies only for corrupt greed. The stories I could tell you folks over the last 5 years working with making natural and organic foods.",9,1

H3YE_oGD05M,"I like your recipies, i¬¥d love to try the vegan nacho cheese, on the other hand, i would like you to know some things becuase those are not mexican dishes, those are TEXMEX. We dont use yellow cheese, we dont even eat nachos (as a mexican dish), for us nachos are an American thing, adding beans is also a Mexican stereotype. Pico de Gallo uses Serrano pepper, not Jalape√±o, but thats ok. \\n\\nThe way we eat tortilla chips is just with smashed beans with queso fresco, or in a soup.\\n\\nMost of the time our quesadillas uses Oaxaca cheese or quesillo, that is white. \\n\\nThats all, hehe... thanks for posting this video, and being aware of the last eartquake, we apreciate it.",5,0

We dont use yellow cheese, we dont even eat nachos (as a mexican dish), for us nachos are an American thing, adding beans is also a Mexican stereotype. Pico de Gallo uses Serrano pepper, not Jalape√±o, but thats ok. \\n\\nThe way we eat tortilla chips is just with smashed beans with queso fresco, or in a soup.\\n\\nMost of the time our quesadillas uses Oaxaca cheese or quesillo, that is white. \\n\\nThats all, hehe... thanks for posting this video, and being aware of the last eartquake, we apreciate it.",7,0

H3YE_oGD05M,"Daiya cheese is un-naturally flavored 59% saturated fat garbage, the manufacturing facility everyone has to wear hazmat like jumpers, boots, nets, full face respirators. Not for sanitary but for the toxic fumes mixing those flavors. Why and how? Because I live near it, I went to culinary school, I have worked in organic and natural food manufacturing of way to many foods and companies using even organic flavors, Oh man, don't believe any of that crap. You'll never find out, the bosses will even tell you not to sample flavored items that are vegan, teas, to foods or what have you. Sorry but Daiya doesn't sit right in my body or any of my vegan friends in Vancouver. Stick to nutritional cheese or Chao cheese. Ethics and manipulation is a flaw in natural foods. I see foods in stores that are expired and were once moldy and are passed as organic. Even in multi-national or International franchises, to amazon to major grocery chains.\\n\\nI have yet to meet one ethical and transparent organic company In the west coast of Canada. They are slave owners and like to say everything is organic and have paid off health inspector informants. Shall I retrieve my emails after great concerns and complaints of many employees I have worked with. Never trust any food manufacturer. Unless you see how it is made, we are blind to this yes. But stay as natural as possible, open kitchen restaurants and farm markets. I rather spend more and help smaller folks out then greedy corrupt families or elitist companies only for corrupt greed. The stories I could tell you folks over the last 5 years working with making natural and organic foods.",9,2

I also appreciate that you're mostly using ingredients I can find near me--I live in a very rural area, with a single grocery store in town. If I want more exotic ingredients, I have to drive about 30-45 mins. To give you and idea of how limited our selections can be, we just started having avacados here as a regular item maybe a year ago. :/ I have never seen jackfruit in person, but I will make an effort to check for it the next time I do an out-of-town grocery run. If that fails, there is always The Interwebs. :) Thanks again, and congrats on the new channel!",0,0

Pico de Gallo uses Serrano pepper, not Jalape√±o, but thats ok. \\n\\nThe way we eat tortilla chips is just with smashed beans with queso fresco, or in a soup.\\n\\nMost of the time our quesadillas uses Oaxaca cheese or quesillo, that is white. \\n\\nThats all, hehe... thanks for posting this video, and being aware of the last eartquake, we apreciate it.",7,0

H3YE_oGD05M,"Daiya cheese is un-naturally flavored 59% saturated fat garbage, the manufacturing facility everyone has to wear hazmat like jumpers, boots, nets, full face respirators. Not for sanitary but for the toxic fumes mixing those flavors. Why and how? Because I live near it, I went to culinary school, I have worked in organic and natural food manufacturing of way to many foods and companies using even organic flavors, Oh man, don't believe any of that crap. You'll never find out, the bosses will even tell you not to sample flavored items that are vegan, teas, to foods or what have you. Sorry but Daiya doesn't sit right in my body or any of my vegan friends in Vancouver. Stick to nutritional cheese or Chao cheese. Ethics and manipulation is a flaw in natural foods. I see foods in stores that are expired and were once moldy and are passed as organic. Even in multi-national or International franchises, to amazon to major grocery chains.\\n\\nI have yet to meet one ethical and transparent organic company In the west coast of Canada. They are slave owners and like to say everything is organic and have paid off health inspector informants. Shall I retrieve my emails after great concerns and complaints of many employees I have worked with. Never trust any food manufacturer. Unless you see how it is made, we are blind to this yes. But stay as natural as possible, open kitchen restaurants and farm markets. I rather spend more and help smaller folks out then greedy corrupt families or elitist companies only for corrupt greed. The stories I could tell you folks over the last 5 years working with making natural and organic foods.",9,2

I saw another video on the munchies YouTube channel where a guy made a BBQ vegan sandwich out of smoked trumpet or king oyster mushrooms. I'm highly intrigued by it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWMIpdhlVZY&t=75s",1,1

H3YE_oGD05M,What happened with meat,7,2
H3YE_oGD05M,"Thank you so much for posting this video! I have just begun my transition to vegan eating, primarily for health and ecological reasons, so this is perfectly timed for me. I also appreciate that you're mostly using ingredients I can find near me--I live in a very rural area, with a single grocery store in town. If I want more exotic ingredients, I have to drive about 30-45 mins. To give you and idea of how limited our selections can be, we just started having avacados here as a regular item maybe a year ago. :/ I have never seen jackfruit in person, but I will make an effort to check for it the next time I do an out-of-town grocery run. If that fails, there is always The Interwebs. :) Thanks again, and congrats on the new channel!",0,1
H3YE_oGD05M,How long does the vegan cheese and sour cream last in the fridge? Can I freeze either? Would love to make in large batches so I can save time/money,0,1

H3YE_oGD05M,"OMG that all looks amazing. Especially the Jackfruit tacos. I am extremely allergic to poultry, eggs, feathers.....the whole nine yards. we are fortunate to live on a farm, so mainly everything comes straight from the Animal or the ground here (with a few exceptions, lol). My husband says we do not do vegan but I so could. I am going to try to trick him with this. Yumm",0,1

H3YE_oGD05M,"Absolutely love this video! Just wanted to add in that Diaya while it is vegan they just switched over and sold out to a company that tests on animals! Just wanted to let you guys know because I know it bothered me when I found out, I didn't know if Jackie is aware of this! But there's so many other vegan cheeses which are even better than Diaya in my opinion like Follow Your Heart and Chao!",0,1
H3YE_oGD05M,"The problem here is that vegan food is way too expensive, produce is absurdly priced in most places, especially avocados, and cashews are expensive too. Meat is and always will be cheaper.",0,5

ypXwioZXUrE,"I really like how this video tries to explain these feelings which are omnipresent in modern society. The reference to art and love is very important, since (especially) art is often underestimated when it comes to psychological health. \\n\\nHowever, I think it's important to go deeper and ask why this psychological asymmetry is even there. It's not correct, I think, to portray it as a normal and legitimate aspect of the human psyche. We must include the influence of society, of how we live in society, and ask whether the way we live now is potentially detrimental to the psychological health of the individual. It's too a vast field to break it down here, but maybe some keywords: Alienation from our capability to have genuine experience, caused by the alienation marking us in the capitalist, marketing-oriented society; our failure to feel ourselves as the ones being in charge of our own lives because we a r e n o t; neuroses caused by undigested childhood trauma, preventing us from developing ourselves, loving ourselves, thus preventing us to love others and making contact with others; eventually the reduction of everything, be it people, relationships etc, to goods, products you can only achieve by trading our own positive (that is, popular) traits and hoping for the other person to see your value as well, thus forcing you to adhere to standards set by other people (by media, propaganda, advertisement, to be precise), not by your own, thus your failure to actualize yourself, to develop what you really are and thereby becoming happy because you experience yourself as a potent actor of your own possibilities. \\n\\nThe list is endless. If anyone read until this point I would recommend reading, for example, Erich Fromm, Abraham Maslow or Karen Horney, or just looking for humanistic psychology.",0,0

I've searched the internet, and when someone asked this African descent what dreadlocks meant to her, she said, They are beautiful. To me when I see them, they mean I am placing a value on myself high enough that I express who I am even at the risk of society's displeasure. Another person also said that, They're a journey into finding myself. They are a strong statement of freedom, irreverence and originality. \\nSo no, not just because it's becoming a 'trend' it's okay to let it pass. There is a deeper meaning to it. And even if another person from the same colour says they don't feel 'upset' or 'offended' towards the act- it is still wrong. Maybe they just don't know what it symbolizes or the history that comes along with it. And you can't just say, Oh it's okay to wear it because my friend says she isn't offended or anything.

TSxt2_QM4N4,"I knew as soon as I saw the braids in his hair it was going to be an issue. Culture appropriation is real, that is for the people in the comments saying its not. I personally don't think a few braids in his hair is a big deal, HOWEVER, just because it doesn't offend me. Doesn't mean that the people it does offend are in the wrong. So everyone in the comments telling people to get over it, you don't have the right to. If they feel they are offended than they are. You can't tell someone how to feel. I understand completely why people get offended over other races wearing braids and dreads. When black people wear these hairstyles, people tend to look down on them and  discriminated agaisnt. But when another race does it; it is seen as edgy. That is the main issue with it. Unless you have ever been judged or discriminated agaisnt for your hairstyle then you will not know how it feels. You have no right to tell someone what they can and can't be offended by. It doesn't work that way.",0,0

Many scenes felt wasted and pointless once the end credits started rolling and to top it off very anti-climatic ending. Action scenes were great and his investigative ability was no Batman but decent. It was interesting but left far too many questions and asking myself why did it veer off into a different direction so many times that it made the previous scenes seem like they never happened. Theater was quiet beginning to end when there's usually discussion just made it that much more saddening.",0,0

Here are some bad replicants search and take em out and became a movie where it asked and presented many things from the viewer to think about in a very subtle way.\\nFelt here it wanted to shove it in your face it had no subtlety.\\n\\nThere was however an interesting hook with the digital being and I wish the movie explored that more/further instead of answering stuff from 1 which could have been just left alone.\\nFlesh life of part 1 versus digital life in part 2 ..again sad it wasnt explored further.\\n\\nIn the end I found it forgetful, slow and bloated. \\n\\nAlso please stop with screaming antagonists when they are angry it feels so childish and cartoony.\\n(Also boss police woman badly acted)\\n\\nAll in all meh.

MfbNXanrhGA,"The Chicago Outfit runs Las Vegas since its foundation. Trump is connected with the Five Families. The Clintons are connected with the Chicago Outfit. The mafia has infiltrated the government. They want to disarm Americans for the purpose of human trafficking. Here is some information on some human traffickers.\\n\\nGianluigi Aponte is an Italian billionaire residing in Geneva Switzerland and owns Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) which is the second largest shipping company in the world. Gianluigi Aponte was born in Naples and is worth around 6 billion. His son Diego Aponte is the President and CEO of MSC. Gianluigi Aponte was awarded the Neapolitan Excellence in the World title in 2009 by the former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Silvio Berlusconi has been tied with La Cosa Nostra in various ways and was a member of the P2 Masonic Lodge in Italy known for being a shadow government involved with political corruption connected with media, banking, mafia, intelligence agencies, and the Vatican. Another member of P2 was Prince Vittorio Emanuele IV of Savoy who is the Prince of Naples just as Gianluigi Aponte was born in Naples. The House of Savoy also ruled over Geneva Switzerland and have a residence there today where Gianluigi Aponte lives. \\n\\nPrince Vittorio also has direct ties with organized crime as he has been charged with murder, exploitation of prostitution, and corruption involving a gambling racket with slot machines. Prince Vittorio got off on all these charges. Camorra is a large international crime syndicate with various clans like the Nuvoletta Mafia operating out of Naples and they are involved in smuggling and even human trafficking as well as other criminal activities. The Letta family with Enrico Letta and Gianni Letta are Italian politicians tied with Sivlio Berlusconi and appear to be connected with the Nuvoletta Camorra mafia clan. In recent years the Sicilian Mafia have been caught involved in trafficking Africans into Italy and Europe and then extorting them. The MSC is relevant because it is covertly working with some high level mafias and involved with drugs, weapons, and human trafficking. Recently in 2017 MSC purchased 49% of Ignazio Messina & C. which is a Genova based shipping and container company. Pontus was a Greek name for bridge and also for sea and specifically the Mediterranean Sea. Through their control over ports they are able to bridge their criminal networks together.",1,7

But, Here with you every step of the way, it hopefully makes you acne free for life like some of the lucky people in the comments. From my 6 months of suffering in the Sahara I'd say stock up on the lip care, heavy-duty moisturizers, eye drops (dry eyes suck), drink even more water than you already do and up your fiber intake as well. For lip care, I swear only Vaseline worked for me. Also, stock up on the family and friends support, keep them close by. And one of the better side effects is that no more oily hair!

G0cDl-vZKkg,"So, I also just started Accutane! I've taken it before, but basically a second cycle needed to happen for me. I will say, the first time I was on it, I deffffffinitely experienced hella dryness all over, including my face. However, I don't think that I adapted my skincare to the type of stuff I was experiencing adequately at all, or at least I didn't do it fast enough. This time around, I like preemptively started using heavy-ass moisturizers and switching out certain products, and it's only been 5 days, but I have experienced minimal dryness/flakiness/all the gross stuff Accutane does to your face before it gets good. I can definitely tell I'm way dryer that normal (I'm usually pretty oily) because the heavy duty products don't make me heavy duty oily, but doing things this way means wearing makeup is 100% an option. I do hair and makeup for a living, so not wearing makeup sort of... can't be a thing for me. But skincare and skin prep make the Accutane thing very doable. Just thought I'd share what has worked for me. :)",0,0

TSxt2_QM4N4,"For all of you who think that cultural appropriation is okay, it's not. \\nThe reason is that not all hairstyles have a deep meaning in it. I've searched the internet, and when someone asked this African descent what dreadlocks meant to her, she said, They are beautiful. To me when I see them, they mean I am placing a value on myself high enough that I express who I am even at the risk of society's displeasure. Another person also said that, They're a journey into finding myself. They are a strong statement of freedom, irreverence and originality. \\nSo no, not just because it's becoming a 'trend' it's okay to let it pass. There is a deeper meaning to it. And even if another person from the same colour says they don't feel 'upset' or 'offended' towards the act- it is still wrong. Maybe they just don't know what it symbolizes or the history that comes along with it. And you can't just say, Oh it's okay to wear it because my friend says she isn't offended or anything. And I mean other idols wore it before too. \\nThat is a fallacy of over-generalisation. Please research about something before making thoughtless comments.",0,0

I personally don't think a few braids in his hair is a big deal, HOWEVER, just because it doesn't offend me. Doesn't mean that the people it does offend are in the wrong. So everyone in the comments telling people to get over it, you don't have the right to. If they feel they are offended than they are. You can't tell someone how to feel. I understand completely why people get offended over other races wearing braids and dreads. When black people wear these hairstyles, people tend to look down on them and  discriminated agaisnt. But when another race does it; it is seen as edgy. That is the main issue with it. Unless you have ever been judged or discriminated agaisnt for your hairstyle then you will not know how it feels. You have no right to tell someone what they can and can't be offended by. It doesn't work that way.",0,0

ypXwioZXUrE,"For me it doesn't help that my parents have told me when I overreact or don't react normal/properly to simple things such as when I feel annoyance or sadness or hate. I once became so upset with a person because they tricked the teachers, lied multiple times a day, and yet they were proud of this and others did not seem to think badly of them. My parents tried to come up with excuses for why this person might do those things but she herself had said she was lazy and had the time to do them on multiple occasions. I broke down into tears because I felt doubted by my family, angry at the girl, wrong and bad for feeling this way, and an extreme hatred that stemmed from my feelings toward myself and her. I can also suddenly hate a person I'm supposed to love for no reason I know of and I have an overwhelming urge to kill any living thing almost every day. My parents have also repeatedly told me that I was using the wrong tone of voice (I would sound annoyed or upset when I wasn't), I was blaming others (I would explain something and mention another person when I was only trying to say how something happened not that it was their fault), and that I am glaring at them (I will try not to cry or just be staring at them).",0,0
ypXwioZXUrE,art? not so sure abut that. especially with it being so subjective.,0,0
ypXwioZXUrE,"1. There is an excellent video by the legendary psychologist Erich Fromm on youtube, where he says:\\n\\nThe most normal are the sickest, and the sick ones are the most healthy\\n\\n( Die Normalsten sind die kr√§nkesten und die Kranken sind die ges√ºndesten. )\\n\\nWhat he means is that people who show absolutely no symptoms of suffering, anxiety, or confusion are the ones who are most in  trouble. Because they are probably supressing everything, being totally alienated from themselves. \\n\\nBut those who worry, suffer and feel  tormented most of the time are indeed the healthy ones because these symptoms show that they are still  connected to their inner selves.\\n\\n Well, isn't that good news??\\n\\n2. Now, just as a thought experiment, take the person who seems to you to be the most different, the most distant person from you. If you think long enough about  him / her, you surely will find a trace of every aspect of his personality within yourself too. \\n\\nThe very same fear or insecurity may turn one person into a wiseman and the other into a tyrant...That's why our personalities seem so different at first sight. But when we label those who don't seem like us as  abnormal indeed we shy away from the task of searching for the same disturbing character features within ourselves.\\n\\nI would also like to recommend a great movie called  Normal. ( With an amazing Jessica Lange and Tom Wilkinson ) There you will find a man who seems  abnormal to everybody in his life including his wife and children!  Poor guy, what a hell that must be... But in the end you will see how much you have in common with him. \\n\\nThat's why I love the movies and literature... They open you the doors to the inner lives of people whom you could never truly get to know, even if they were your neighbours, your partner or your best friend...A great book or movie has the capacity to show you every aspect of a human being. In real life you only see that what the other person allows you to see, plus what your intuition adds to it. \\n\\n( You can at least watch the trailer of the movie on youtube. Just search  for:  Normal - Trailer Jessica Lange, Tom Wilkinson. The acting is really incredible!! )\\n\\n3.  The good thing about none of us  being normal, is that when just ONE person dares to open up, be vulberable and be himself, then it helps all the people around him to liberate themselves too. There is a really wonderful example of this on a RADIOLAB podcast called  The New Normal. It is the story of Stu Rasmusen, the first trangender mayor in the US. He managed to be the mayor of a very conservative small town and change everybody's perspective about what it means to be normal! \\n\\n\\n4. And here is a remedy for all shy friends: \\n\\nYou can read Ryszard Kapuscinski's wonderful book  The Other . That can really  be a life changing experience for you. Because: what can help overcoming shyness more than realising that there is NO other?\\nWe sometimes exaggerate our differences in order to  confirm our identity and feel ourselves more special. But we must indeed do the opposite: we must always deliberately look for what we have in common. It would be helpful to have these simple lines always in mind:\\n\\n You are human beings nonetheless.\\n As far as one can see\\n Of the same species as myself \\n\\n( Pozzo, in Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot )\\n\\nThanks a lot for this very consoling lesson and for the truly wonderful animation!",1,0

ypXwioZXUrE,"Loneliness is that feeling to be stranger; the fact is that we're all strangers to each other. We live between two worlds; the inside and the outside, if you focus in the one of the inside, you'll fall in anxiety, depression and anguish and if you just focus in one of the outside you'll lose your confidence in yourself and you fall in the same illness. The other is a book, be courageous and go to the library and chose a book. Open it and start reading. We're all strangers.",0,0
ypXwioZXUrE,"This is, as often, an excellent synopsis, but I wish it would elaborate on the point that deals with the expression of internal feelings in art and love a bit more in depth instead of cutting it short at this quite important intersection. I feel like it's all a dilemma - We eithe repress our feelings like everyone else, or we choose to display them more openly at the risk of becoming vulnerable in the presence of the people we thereby choose to trust. As an artist, I've also run into a third phenomenon - where I've personally become a screen for others to project their own feelings onto because they started to view me as deep and special because of the work I do while not at all making a connection to their own innermost stuffings. This inevitably resulted in repeated cases of very tiring groupiedom. I do feel producing artworks makes for exchange and connection with other artists, though, which is a wonderful byproduct of making art and, measured by the concept presented in this video, this would be the successful scenario of solving the asymmetry. Yet --- Is this one of those problems where you end up dissatisfied whichever option you choose? Because I don't feel like being an artist has helped me with feeling lonely and odd. Like, at all.

4kX7iBnoivA,"I disagree. 10/10 for me, partly because of the pacing. It's what made certain scenes so incredibly powerful, that otherwise wouldn't have been.

4kX7iBnoivA,I liked Blade Runner 1 but never became a hard fan. People have told me to watch it more times to truly get it. But I felt like Blade Runner 2049 really shed some new light on the old one. It made me appreciate it a lot more. It's a masterpiece.,0,0
4kX7iBnoivA,"I'm surprised by the glowing reviews. ¬†I thought it was a valiant effort, but fell short. ¬†It didn't look as slick as the original, and Harrison Ford ¬†felt tacked on, as though the studio thought, if he dies during production, we have to be able to salvage the rest of the show. ¬†I'm really not a fan of these sequels made years later, where the main character from the first essentially has a cameo at the end, which is what this was. ¬†I would have rather seen a fresh Blade Runner story with only Ryan Gosling (and that's coming from a huge Harrison Ford fan)",0,0

4kX7iBnoivA,"I thought this movie was awesome. I agree that the pacing was too slow at places but I like to think it was in aid of the story telling and character development.

4kX7iBnoivA,"I thought the original sucked. But I loved this movie, with the caveat that it's the type movie that I will realistically only watch once due to the pacing.\\n\\nI will say, this movie felt just like the original - but it improved on everything to such a large degree, that it made me understand why others could have seen the original as a masterpiece. If I had watched the original in the early 80's, perhaps it would have had the same impression on me. As someone who didn't see it until 5 years ago, I honestly couldn't understand why it was such a cult classic.\\n\\nBut it's not just about the improvements on technology either. To be clear, even the way they explored the question of what makes someone human? was far more fascinating and emotionally compelling here then in the original.",0,0
4kX7iBnoivA,Its not the way conventional films are made its very different. It has a gripping story with some great visuals on the settings but can be a little too dark on the visuals for me.,0,0

I think so, but the movie has so many subplots that go NOWHERE and it makes a very simple plot very confusing... perhaps that's why, to disguise a simple plot? Seems unnecessary. I almost left the movie because it became a mess to follow, but the CGI was amazing and Harrison Ford hadn't appeared yet. Yeah, wait about two hours for that to happen.",0,0

4kX7iBnoivA,"Okay first of all before l get started about my review on this, l want to say that the first Blade Runner is my all-time favorite movie, it's fantastic in my eyes and a real work of art in the Sci Fi genre. As for Blade Runner 2049...I was a little disappointed. Lets go over the positives first. This movie is stunning and beautiful to look at, the cinematography is brilliant! It's truthfully mind blowing and almost worth the price of admission alone. This movie also had a lot of interesting Sci Fi elements that are new and innovative, like Ryan Gosling's holographic girlfriend. I've never seen anything quite like it, it was pretty cool. The actors were all very strong in their performances, so much so that it left me wanting more from certain characters. I really enjoyed Jared Leto's performance, he's pulls off an especially creepy and mysterious character. I wanted more Leto to be honest.\\nNegatives\\nThis film is slooooooooowwww and too long! And I love slow movies usually! They unnecessarily stretch scenes out to the point where you're bored....and as a BIG Blade Runner fan it pains me to say that! I'm upset actually that l felt this way about this movie. The movie has pacing issues for sure. I also found the main plot of the story a little thin, it wasn't hard to get lost in this movie and wonder where are they going with this? They tried to throw a twist in, but truthfully when the twist is unraveled or revealed I didn't care, it was underwhelming. For a movie being 2 hrs 40 mins l actually expected more out of it. Certain scenes were too long and drawn out, and other parts were sorrily lacking depth. The original Blade Runner story is way better in my opinion. Also Harrison Ford doesn't even show up until the last 40 mins and by the end of movie I thought to myself, did they even really need him? Overall the movie is OK, which again sucks for me to say, because if the pacing and story was a little bit stronger and things flowed a bit better this movie could have easily been a 10/10 for Sci Fi. To sum it all up it's a good movie with some extraordinary visuals and very cool Sci Fi technology/elements and the acting is strong, but has serious pacing problems, it's too long and the story is average. LOL the first Blade Runner has a faster pace! So to all those people who thought the first one was slow, don't even bother with this one. I would definitely watch Blade Runner 2049 again as I feel I could definitely learn new things and l want to see if my opinion changes to a more positive one. Overall my rating is a 7/10.....barely.",0,0

MfbNXanrhGA,"The Chicago Outfit runs Las Vegas since its foundation. Trump is connected with the Five Families. The Clintons are connected with the Chicago Outfit. The mafia has infiltrated the government. They want to disarm Americans for the purpose of human trafficking. Here is some information on some human traffickers.\\n\\nGianluigi Aponte is an Italian billionaire residing in Geneva Switzerland and owns Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) which is the second largest shipping company in the world. Gianluigi Aponte was born in Naples and is worth around 6 billion. His son Diego Aponte is the President and CEO of MSC. Gianluigi Aponte was awarded the Neapolitan Excellence in the World title in 2009 by the former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. Silvio Berlusconi has been tied with La Cosa Nostra in various ways and was a member of the P2 Masonic Lodge in Italy known for being a shadow government involved with political corruption connected with media, banking, mafia, intelligence agencies, and the Vatican. Another member of P2 was Prince Vittorio Emanuele IV of Savoy who is the Prince of Naples just as Gianluigi Aponte was born in Naples. The House of Savoy also ruled over Geneva Switzerland and have a residence there today where Gianluigi Aponte lives. \\n\\nPrince Vittorio also has direct ties with organized crime as he has been charged with murder, exploitation of prostitution, and corruption involving a gambling racket with slot machines. Prince Vittorio got off on all these charges. Camorra is a large international crime syndicate with various clans like the Nuvoletta Mafia operating out of Naples and they are involved in smuggling and even human trafficking as well as other criminal activities. The Letta family with Enrico Letta and Gianni Letta are Italian politicians tied with Sivlio Berlusconi and appear to be connected with the Nuvoletta Camorra mafia clan. In recent years the Sicilian Mafia have been caught involved in trafficking Africans into Italy and Europe and then extorting them. The MSC is relevant because it is covertly working with some high level mafias and involved with drugs, weapons, and human trafficking. Recently in 2017 MSC purchased 49% of Ignazio Messina & C. which is a Genova based shipping and container company. Pontus was a Greek name for bridge and also for sea and specifically the Mediterranean Sea. Through their control over ports they are able to bridge their criminal networks together.",1,7

G0cDl-vZKkg,"Hi guys!! Will be starting Accutane on Oct 12 (assuming all goes well with lab results on the 11th) and will be having the acne story video coming the following week! I'll be documenting each month on Accutane & filming update videos, etc. This video was pre-filmed, so I ended up being able to get about 2 months of Foundation Friday videos pre-filmed in time before starting Accutane- yay! xx",1188,124

G0cDl-vZKkg,Hi from NZ!! First off can I say that you are an absolute inspiration to all those who suffer with acne. You are incredibly beautiful and I hope all goes well with the accutane. I went on isotane (very similar) and I went off due to some emotional side effects but hey everyone is differentüòä My advise is pretty much the same as most people: A good lip balm and moisturizer is everything:)  Good Luck.,0,0

G0cDl-vZKkg,"Accutane cured me but it took 3 trials for me. Each time the acne was less and so were the sides (good luck with accutane during cold winter months). First my Chest acne was cured, second try my back was cleared and finally after my final try my face was cleared. It took me 2.5 years to fully get over acne at the ripe age of 23 lol. Even my scars have healed I'm 26 now. Tanning helps with the scars.",0,0

G0cDl-vZKkg,Accutane is seriously worth it. There will be scaring but it will go away with time. But it‚Äôs one of the best decisions a person with acne can make.,0,0
G0cDl-vZKkg,"Makeup is great and all but I think it does more harm than good. Sure it may cover up what you believe to be major imperfections but it damages the skin even more. \\n\\nHonestly I‚Äôd suggest to women that use makeup to first drink at least a gallon of water a day, wear sunscreen in the morning, try not to eat foods that are really oily, and moisturize after your bath/shower. It‚Äôs troubling to see what some women have to go through everyday to feel confident in themselves. \\n\\nIt may sound cliche but guys appreciate it when women don‚Äôt wear makeup. Unless of course you‚Äôre doing it for yourself, that‚Äôs cool too...",0,0

G0cDl-vZKkg,"Hi Taylor! I discovered your channel about a month ago and I just wanted you to know how refreshing your confidence is. I have struggled with severe acne for awhile now and could not find anything that worked until recently. Unsurprisingly, the cure had nothing to do with unsolicited advice given to me, rather it was an extreme medical regiment. I can't tell you how frustrating it can be to watch some beauty gurus pretend to spot conceal their nonexistent hyperpigmentation and then tell me how good the coverage is. Your makeup advice would've been wonderful for me when I was going through the thick of my bad skin days and had no knowledge on how to cover it and feel confident again. People do not realize how painful, expensive, and embarrassing it can be to have severe acne and you push onward with a fuck it attitude that I love. You are in no way defined by your skin, but I know how exciting it is to finally have relief from it all and I can't wait for you to feel that too! \\nKeep doing you, I can't wait to watch more of your videos! ‚ù§Ô∏è",0,0
G0cDl-vZKkg,Hey girl! Skin changing post accutane is pretty common but not always. My sister when right back to being super oily.

I use the soap and glory one heck of a blot primer (mattifying) or the Lanc√¥me La Base (pore filling) and set it with a super light layer of the cover FX translucent setting powder if I use the Lanc√¥me primer, and it stays on really well when I do that. I also apply it with a sponge. I like the Lanc√¥me primer a little better with the foundation because it makes the foundation look lighter and less cakey, but the soap and glory really helps keep it matte.",0,0
G0cDl-vZKkg,Im super excited for your Accutane journey!! I'm on my last month now and its one of the best decisions i ever made. The most annoying thing I've encountered has been EXTREMELY dry lips and nosebleeds. But totally worth it. In the beginning your skin will be basically flaking off so its hard wearing foundation but as the months pass it gets better. But the dry lips for me have stayed all throughout my 6 months on the medication. Anyways keep us updated and any advice you need ill make sure to comment here! :0),0,0

I once became so upset with a person because they tricked the teachers, lied multiple times a day, and yet they were proud of this and others did not seem to think badly of them. My parents tried to come up with excuses for why this person might do those things but she herself had said she was lazy and had the time to do them on multiple occasions. I broke down into tears because I felt doubted by my family, angry at the girl, wrong and bad for feeling this way, and an extreme hatred that stemmed from my feelings toward myself and her. I can also suddenly hate a person I'm supposed to love for no reason I know of and I have an overwhelming urge to kill any living thing almost every day. My parents have also repeatedly told me that I was using the wrong tone of voice (I would sound annoyed or upset when I wasn't), I was blaming others (I would explain something and mention another person when I was only trying to say how something happened not that it was their fault), and that I am glaring at them (I will try not to cry or just be staring at them).",0,0

ypXwioZXUrE,"This is, as often, an excellent synopsis, but I wish it would elaborate on the point that deals with the expression of internal feelings in art and love a bit more in depth instead of cutting it short at this quite important intersection. I feel like it's all a dilemma - We eithe repress our feelings like everyone else, or we choose to display them more openly at the risk of becoming vulnerable in the presence of the people we thereby choose to trust. As an artist, I've also run into a third phenomenon - where I've personally become a screen for others to project their own feelings onto because they started to view me as deep and special because of the work I do while not at all making a connection to their own innermost stuffings. This inevitably resulted in repeated cases of very tiring groupiedom. I do feel producing artworks makes for exchange and connection with other artists, though, which is a wonderful byproduct of making art and, measured by the concept presented in this video, this would be the successful scenario of solving the asymmetry. Yet --- Is this one of those problems where you end up dissatisfied whichever option you choose? Because I don't feel like being an artist has helped me with feeling lonely and odd. Like, at all.

ypXwioZXUrE,"1. There is an excellent video by the legendary psychologist Erich Fromm on youtube, where he says:\\n\\nThe most normal are the sickest, and the sick ones are the most healthy\\n\\n( Die Normalsten sind die kr√§nkesten und die Kranken sind die ges√ºndesten. )\\n\\nWhat he means is that people who show absolutely no symptoms of suffering, anxiety, or confusion are the ones who are most in  trouble. Because they are probably supressing everything, being totally alienated from themselves. \\n\\nBut those who worry, suffer and feel  tormented most of the time are indeed the healthy ones because these symptoms show that they are still  connected to their inner selves.\\n\\n Well, isn't that good news??\\n\\n2. Now, just as a thought experiment, take the person who seems to you to be the most different, the most distant person from you. If you think long enough about  him / her, you surely will find a trace of every aspect of his personality within yourself too. \\n\\nThe very same fear or insecurity may turn one person into a wiseman and the other into a tyrant...That's why our personalities seem so different at first sight. But when we label those who don't seem like us as  abnormal indeed we shy away from the task of searching for the same disturbing character features within ourselves.\\n\\nI would also like to recommend a great movie called  Normal. ( With an amazing Jessica Lange and Tom Wilkinson ) There you will find a man who seems  abnormal to everybody in his life including his wife and children!  Poor guy, what a hell that must be... But in the end you will see how much you have in common with him. \\n\\nThat's why I love the movies and literature... They open you the doors to the inner lives of people whom you could never truly get to know, even if they were your neighbours, your partner or your best friend...A great book or movie has the capacity to show you every aspect of a human being. In real life you only see that what the other person allows you to see, plus what your intuition adds to it. \\n\\n( You can at least watch the trailer of the movie on youtube. Just search  for:  Normal - Trailer Jessica Lange, Tom Wilkinson. The acting is really incredible!! )\\n\\n3.  The good thing about none of us  being normal, is that when just ONE person dares to open up, be vulberable and be himself, then it helps all the people around him to liberate themselves too. There is a really wonderful example of this on a RADIOLAB podcast called  The New Normal. It is the story of Stu Rasmusen, the first trangender mayor in the US. He managed to be the mayor of a very conservative small town and change everybody's perspective about what it means to be normal! \\n\\n\\n4. And here is a remedy for all shy friends: \\n\\nYou can read Ryszard Kapuscinski's wonderful book  The Other . That can really  be a life changing experience for you. Because: what can help overcoming shyness more than realising that there is NO other?\\nWe sometimes exaggerate our differences in order to  confirm our identity and feel ourselves more special. But we must indeed do the opposite: we must always deliberately look for what we have in common. It would be helpful to have these simple lines always in mind:\\n\\n You are human beings nonetheless.\\n As far as one can see\\n Of the same species as myself \\n\\n( Pozzo, in Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot )\\n\\nThanks a lot for this very consoling lesson and for the truly wonderful animation!",1,0

ypXwioZXUrE,"No one likes me, especially in school. When I was doing math today,  we were told to check our work with others. I had no choice but to look around. Everyone had a partner but me, then I sat at my desk. I watched people that looked like they were heading towards me, but dodge me. Heading to the person behind me. at that point, I was in a disappointed state. I looked over my work, pretending to fix a big mistake I had made on my paper. But i had really made the big mistake of even thinking, someone cares about me.\\n\\nExcept for one girl, she has been talking to me since last year, filling me in on what I've missed on days I was absent. And talking to me about her day. I really appreciate what she is doing. I hope she won't stop, but my shyness may draw her away from me.. It really seeps through.\\n\\nWhat makes me sad, is that she has been the only one nice enough to talk to me, in 5 years. \\n\\nThat, is what I call, a miracle. \\n\\n\\n\\nüò≠",1,2

TSxt2_QM4N4,"For all of you who think that cultural appropriation is okay, it's not. \\nThe reason is that not all hairstyles have a deep meaning in it. I've searched the internet, and when someone asked this African descent what dreadlocks meant to her, she said, They are beautiful. To me when I see them, they mean I am placing a value on myself high enough that I express who I am even at the risk of society's displeasure. Another person also said that, They're a journey into finding myself. They are a strong statement of freedom, irreverence and originality. \\nSo no, not just because it's becoming a 'trend' it's okay to let it pass. There is a deeper meaning to it. And even if another person from the same colour says they don't feel 'upset' or 'offended' towards the act- it is still wrong. Maybe they just don't know what it symbolizes or the history that comes along with it. And you can't just say, Oh it's okay to wear it because my friend says she isn't offended or anything. And I mean other idols wore it before too. \\nThat is a fallacy of over-generalisation. Please research about something before making thoughtless comments.",0,0

I personally don't think a few braids in his hair is a big deal, HOWEVER, just because it doesn't offend me. Doesn't mean that the people it does offend are in the wrong. So everyone in the comments telling people to get over it, you don't have the right to. If they feel they are offended than they are. You can't tell someone how to feel. I understand completely why people get offended over other races wearing braids and dreads. When black people wear these hairstyles, people tend to look down on them and  discriminated agaisnt. But when another race does it; it is seen as edgy. That is the main issue with it. Unless you have ever been judged or discriminated agaisnt for your hairstyle then you will not know how it feels. You have no right to tell someone what they can and can't be offended by. It doesn't work that way.",0,0

TSxt2_QM4N4,"I wrote this on a few posts but.. I don't want to be a scrawny dumbass hater (I love EXO and SM artists so much) but what pisses me off is the fact that WHENEVER another idol that isn't EXO wears braids for literally just like one day and never again, they get into a scandal, they get bashed, they lose fans and they get hate. They STILL get talked about even after apologising numerous times. Kai, WinWin and Lay all had braids, Kai and WinWin wore them whilst performing and they never got talked about. It seems as though it's only acceptable because it's EXO, lmao I'm sick of that shit. I know some whiny ass fans will come for me but I have the right to express my opinion. I have seen enough of and NUMEROUS reports of other idols wearing braids when it's just for a photo shoot getting hated on and being on countless news articles and when EXO or any SM artists as a matter of fact wear them it's all cool just because they have an extremely large amount of fans standing up for them. Before y'all say it's not cultural appropriation lmao first of all, I would write like 10 paragraphs for you to understand but I really don't want to waste my time on something that won't change the minds of clueless people.",0,2

4kX7iBnoivA,"Watched the movie over the weekend, after having watched the 1982 one twice. As an animation & art enthusiast, it was absolutely breathtaking - I was sitting through the entire movie with my mouth wide open. The movie is full of haunting visuals, incredibly immersive audio & a whole lot of substance & heart. I whole-heartedly recommend watching it in a cinema, if you can, because this movie really benefits from it.",0,0
4kX7iBnoivA,"I like the old Blade Runner, but I do very much agree that the pacing in the old one and the new one are both just awful. Great ideas, philosophical questions about humanity and special effects are what makes Blade Runner important, but goodness gracious was this new one full of dull characters. The most lively character was Harrison Ford's. Ryan Gosling and Jared Leto are both phenomenal actors in my opinion, but they were both so crippled by their characters in this film. They didn't get the opportunity to showcase their talents in this one. The plot was also rather cut and dry. I respect everyone's opinion but that's just mine, and I figured I'd share it even though no one really cares.",0,0

4kX7iBnoivA,For me its a near cinematic perfection as you can get .I liked it when i first saw it on video long after its original release.I grew to love it and now its my number one movie of all time so far.I did not get to that point right away but its a film you see say hey Harrison Ford hes good lets watch it.Oooh effects intense bad guy that isnt really a simple bad guy.Later you think about the films themes and start to theorise.I watched the various cuts and you started to see more  of Ridleys original vision and then you get the final cut.This film has been like a love affair.Attraction interest mystery intrigue discovery  love.Yep im a fan no i dont have bits of the set or one of Harrison Fords ties.Idont go to comicon dressed as one of the characters.I just love the film,0,0
4kX7iBnoivA,"This movie seriously sucked, I don't understand what the hype is about. The story barely chugs along and is way too predictable. Then there are several moments that to arrive at a destination in the plot, the story negates all logic to get there. The audio was completely out of place and sounded like a speaker was being unplugged (staticy). Ryan Gosling was awful, zero emotion. Granted he didn't play his usual smug/prick self that he usually does, but he really was just reading dialogue. But the worst part about this (outside of the 3 hr run time of boredom) is that it wants you to think that it is incredibly deep, thought provoking and artsy. The reality is that this film is shallow, predictable and generic; making it feel completely pretentious. During my screening, the guy next to me feel asleep and several people walked out. Please save your money.",0,0

4kX7iBnoivA,"So to answer your question: Yes, it is absolutely possible to be a fan of this movie, even though you are not a fan of the original! I was born in 1995 and even though I really liked the story and concept of the original Blade Runner movie, I just couldn't stand the aesthetics of it. The whole visual style just made me feel so uncomfortable while watching it (kind of similar to the movie Brasil) that I couldn't enjoy it as a whole. That is to say I aknowledge, that it was a very groundbreaking movie that deserves the many fans it has, just for me personally it was not as enjoyable! \\nNow Blade Runner 2049 brought the same qualities as described before just with a different, more modern visual style. So now that I could actually not only stand looking at it without feeling uncomfortable, but actually be amazed and stunned by the imigary, I was just blown away by this movie! \\nSo I love this movie and I think it is very unfortunate, that I can't enjoy the first Blade Runner the way it would deserve it!",0,0

It took 20 years to finally watch it all the way through to the end and even then I started checking my phone and web surfing during the dull parts. I did a lot of surfing. But this movie, I was totally into.

4kX7iBnoivA,"After watching this movie twice, I finally feel ready to comment. *SPOILERS BELOW!* (It's definitely worth a second viewing. It's a dense and rich movie and you will catch small things upon second viewing that you missed the first time.)\\n\\nIf you saw and liked the original Blade Runner (any version), you'll definitely like this movie! If you like cerebral, thoughtful movies, you'll almost assuredly like this movie. If you don't mind movies like Solaris, 2001, Her, and even the original Star Trek movie, then you'll probably like this movie. But if none of those movies appeal to you, or you don't like deliberately slow-paced movies, or you prefer lots of action, or you can't sit still for 2.75 hours, then maybe you might not like it.\\n\\nPersonally, the original is one of my all-time faves, and, after watching the new movie twice in two days, I'm simultaneously both more impressed than before and more critical than after the first viewing. I dare say that I enjoyed it more than before. I especially like the first half, before he meets Deckard. Up until that point, it's nearly perfect.\\n\\nI must be contrarian and say that I am underwhelmed with the score. It's either unobtrusive ambient synth, or a nearly (and at times exactly) direct copy of the Vangelis original (especially the Tears in Rain ending), or over-the-top blown-out bass which sounds like an airplane landing. And I still feel like the super loud parts were overdone, especially in scenes that didn't seem to call for it.\\n\\nNow for the nitpicks:\\n\\n--> When K first thought he might be human, why didn't he use that device to check his eye for a serial number?\\n\\n--> After failing the baseline test, he was told he had 48 hours. So why didn't he know that the LAPD would be able to follow him? It's never revealed if they have tracking devices implanted into them or not, but he at least should have ditched his police-issue car.\\n\\n--> Why didn't JOI see the prostitute replicant place the tracking device in his coat? (Was she turned off? Why? We hear the chime later, but never see him turn her on.) The assumption is she always watching, just like when she knew that K hadn't told the police chief about the birthdate from his memory.\\n\\n--> Why did Wallace have to send Deckard off world in order to torture him? You mean he doesn't have everything he needs on Earth, where he is and where he makes the new replicants?\\n\\n--> How was K even able to track Love when she was transporting Deckard off world?\\n\\n--> Why didn't K kill Deckard? I had thought he would side with the replicant rebellion. (Maybe he still felt a bit like Deckard was his father even after he realized that it wasn't true, but still...)\\n\\n--> Why would they think that everyone will assume Deckard drowned? Come on. Wouldn't it be more logical to assume that Wallace would not be satisfied until he found a body...? Surely they have the technology to find it.\\n\\n--> I don't think K should have died from his knife injuries. Yes, it was a vicious wound, but look at all he did AFTER receiving the injury. Also, they made it clear earlier in the movie that replicants are tough and can handle injuries that would likely kill a normal human.\\n\\n--> Love is a cool villain, but she was still a bit too one-dimensional. Personally, I would have liked to have seen more depth and more ambiguity, (much like Roy Baty from the original where he saves Deckard at the end so he has someone to watch him die).\\n\\nIMO, I didn't like K's apparent death - too much trying to mirror the Roy Baty death scene. If anything, I think it would have been more poetic and made more sense for Deckard to have died. K should have lived to join and become a leader of the upcoming replicant rebellion (which would make a great topic for the next movie, BTW).\\n\\nYet, all of this being said, I still think I liked it even more after the second viewing, especially the first half/two-thirds. The longer the movie goes, the more convoluted it becomes and the more the thread unravels.\\n\\nIt's still a great movie! But that doesn't mean that it doesn't have flaws. It could have been even better... Nevertheless, I'd still give it a 9/10.",0,0
4kX7iBnoivA,"I agree that the movie is too long because there are slow parts which have little to do with the story. \\nIt's worth seeing.

q0B8k3UPZNc,"The thing that many people dont know is that Qatar Airways actually has 2 (or even 3) business class configurations. They have the 1-2-1 configuration on all of their A350s, B787s, and their A380s. And they also have a less common but still nice business class which is on most of their planes, like the A340, A330, and B777, this less common Business class is set up in a 2-2-2 way, it might sound like it‚Äôs a bit cramped, but surprisingly, it‚Äôs not. And then there is the third Business class configuration or what I call ‚Äúpremium economy‚Äù, which is their Business class on their A320 planes, they have it set up in a 2-2 configuration, due to the A320 not being as wide as it‚Äôs counterparts. I‚Äôve tried all 3 of their business classes, and I‚Äôve got to admit, the 1-2-1 configuration is my absolute favorite. With the 2-2-2 configuration privacy is a bit of an issue if you‚Äôre traveling alone, which doesn‚Äôt seem to be an issue at all in the 1-2-1 configuration. Aside from that, the 1-2-1 is more spacious and and luxurious.",0,0

G0cDl-vZKkg,Hi Taylor. This isn't makeup related and I know you don't like to make personal videos but I was wondering if you have any remedies or suggestions for my sister's migraines. She got a really bad one today and I feel so bad not being able to help her.,0,0
G0cDl-vZKkg,Glad to see a negative review on this foundation. I have combo skin. No breakouts or issues typical combo. I tried this so many times before I tossed. It looked like crap around my nose. Made my pores look huge no matter what primer and broke down in my t zone.,0,0

Salicylic acid, benzoyl peroxide, no makeup, working out 3x a week for a year, more sleep, more water. I did all organic food with no processed foods and no dairy for 3 weeks. (The ultimate reset) \\nGuess what. I still have cystic acne. I am now 44 and am considering doing accutane, even though I‚Äôm terrified of the side effects. Nobody who hasn‚Äôt dealt with this for most of their life gets to have an opinion on what will get rid of it. \\nGood for you, Taylor. I hope it works well for you.",1,0

G0cDl-vZKkg,Hi from NZ!! First off can I say that you are an absolute inspiration to all those who suffer with acne. You are incredibly beautiful and I hope all goes well with the accutane. I went on isotane (very similar) and I went off due to some emotional side effects but hey everyone is differentüòä My advise is pretty much the same as most people: A good lip balm and moisturizer is everything:)  Good Luck.,0,0

G0cDl-vZKkg,"Accutane cured me but it took 3 trials for me. Each time the acne was less and so were the sides (good luck with accutane during cold winter months). First my Chest acne was cured, second try my back was cleared and finally after my final try my face was cleared. It took me 2.5 years to fully get over acne at the ripe age of 23 lol. Even my scars have healed I'm 26 now. Tanning helps with the scars.",0,0

G0cDl-vZKkg,"Makeup is great and all but I think it does more harm than good. Sure it may cover up what you believe to be major imperfections but it damages the skin even more. \\n\\nHonestly I‚Äôd suggest to women that use makeup to first drink at least a gallon of water a day, wear sunscreen in the morning, try not to eat foods that are really oily, and moisturize after your bath/shower. It‚Äôs troubling to see what some women have to go through everyday to feel confident in themselves. \\n\\nIt may sound cliche but guys appreciate it when women don‚Äôt wear makeup.

G0cDl-vZKkg,"Hi Taylor! I discovered your channel about a month ago and I just wanted you to know how refreshing your confidence is. I have struggled with severe acne for awhile now and could not find anything that worked until recently. Unsurprisingly, the cure had nothing to do with unsolicited advice given to me, rather it was an extreme medical regiment. I can't tell you how frustrating it can be to watch some beauty gurus pretend to spot conceal their nonexistent hyperpigmentation and then tell me how good the coverage is. Your makeup advice would've been wonderful for me when I was going through the thick of my bad skin days and had no knowledge on how to cover it and feel confident again. People do not realize how painful, expensive, and embarrassing it can be to have severe acne and you push onward with a fuck it attitude that I love. You are in no way defined by your skin, but I know how exciting it is to finally have relief from it all and I can't wait for you to feel that too! \\nKeep doing you, I can't wait to watch more of your videos! ‚ù§Ô∏è",0,0

I used you as an example to how good she could be one day a she loves you to bits (she's is 8 and she is not aloud to like boys lol) is there anyway you could if her a few words of encouragement and explain that her coaches are just trying to encourage her to get better and better.

Don't waste your life and your purpose God has created you for, don't waste yourself for folly things that are pointless if it won't encourage you and bring you closer to Jesus and bring your faith to shine more, it is not worth it, Following Jesus is amen, He will comfort you and wipe your tears and remind you of his unfailing love for you, For He is your true father from above in the heavens amen, He is a Father to the fatherless, don't mess with them because if God hears their precious cries and tears then you will be destroyed, God is a judge for the widows, Don't mess with them because God will judge you and you'll be in great trouble, God is an Awesome and Fair God, God of Israel Amen.\\n\\nIf there's no love which is Jesus, Then people will error greatly and follow their own way and it may seem good outside and they may try to use history to back up their foolish imaginations, but inside them, it isn't the truth, neither is it good, And Good works will never be enough to enter into the Kingdom of God only through Lord Jesus Christ, who paid our debt and did it for us, You only have to believe and have Faith, not belief and your feelings those are entirely different from Faith and believing, having a relationship with Lord Jesus Christ who is God is the Good news and the Truth Amen.\\n\\nThere are sad people on this world that rather reject God and go after the world which is pointless and no hope for them unless they be willing to turn to the Father, Jesus can change a wicked sinner into a beautiful, clean saint, And how beautiful it is indeed, You won't learn from anything from this video neither anything else but from God's words alone, The Holy Bible King James Bible Amen, You have to take everything from God's words literally and ask for Jesus for Guidance and help in his words and you will see, You will understand that others will not because everyone is different and unique, Just like the stars God created for example, Each having names and each being very unique and beautiful, But for you, You are much more to God then the Stars, God of Israel Loves You Unconditionallay and you will always be important to God but if you continue to live in sin, Don't do it, Go any deeper and there will be no hope for you and there will be no way for you to come to repentance, But it is never too late right now while there is still time, Jesus is able to restore the soul and deliver everyone from falling, You only need to look deep into God's words and learn from him Amen.\\n\\nWhat will you do? Get up and get away from being comfortable to this world, Living for Jesus Christ is worth it Amen, There are greater things ahead that this world will never understand but only in Jesus alone, God knows your heart and there's no hiding anything from him, You can hide in a cave but that still won't hide yourself from him, It's a very very very terrible, Dreadful and terrifying experience to be standing against a Strong and Powerful Living God who created you and form you with a purpose, But how a great blessing and beautiful it is to stand with our True Father God who is Mighty and Strong, God can do the impossible and never doubt him, He's GOD OF THE LIVING!

My parents tried to come up with excuses for why this person might do those things but she herself had said she was lazy and had the time to do them on multiple occasions. I broke down into tears because I felt doubted by my family, angry at the girl, wrong and bad for feeling this way, and an extreme hatred that stemmed from my feelings toward myself and her. I can also suddenly hate a person I'm supposed to love for no reason I know of and I have an overwhelming urge to kill any living thing almost every day. My parents have also repeatedly told me that I was using the wrong tone of voice (I would sound annoyed or upset when I wasn't), I was blaming others (I would explain something and mention another person when I was only trying to say how something happened not that it was their fault), and that I am glaring at them (I will try not to cry or just be staring at them).",0,0

ypXwioZXUrE,"Loneliness is that feeling to be stranger; the fact is that we're all strangers to each other. We live between two worlds; the inside and the outside, if you focus in the one of the inside, you'll fall in anxiety, depression and anguish and if you just focus in one of the outside you'll lose your confidence in yourself and you fall in the same illness. The other is a book, be courageous and go to the library and chose a book. Open it and start reading. We're all strangers.",0,0
ypXwioZXUrE,"This is, as often, an excellent synopsis, but I wish it would elaborate on the point that deals with the expression of internal feelings in art and love a bit more in depth instead of cutting it short at this quite important intersection. I feel like it's all a dilemma - We eithe repress our feelings like everyone else, or we choose to display them more openly at the risk of becoming vulnerable in the presence of the people we thereby choose to trust. As an artist, I've also run into a third phenomenon - where I've personally become a screen for others to project their own feelings onto because they started to view me as deep and special because of the work I do while not at all making a connection to their own innermost stuffings. This inevitably resulted in repeated cases of very tiring groupiedom. I do feel producing artworks makes for exchange and connection with other artists, though, which is a wonderful byproduct of making art and, measured by the concept presented in this video, this would be the successful scenario of solving the asymmetry. Yet --- Is this one of those problems where you end up dissatisfied whichever option you choose? Because I don't feel like being an artist has helped me with feeling lonely and odd. Like, at all. Neither has love.",0,0

ypXwioZXUrE,"1. There is an excellent video by the legendary psychologist Erich Fromm on youtube, where he says:\\n\\nThe most normal are the sickest, and the sick ones are the most healthy\\n\\n( Die Normalsten sind die kr√§nkesten und die Kranken sind die ges√ºndesten. )\\n\\nWhat he means is that people who show absolutely no symptoms of suffering, anxiety, or confusion are the ones who are most in  trouble. Because they are probably supressing everything, being totally alienated from themselves. \\n\\nBut those who worry, suffer and feel  tormented most of the time are indeed the healthy ones because these symptoms show that they are still  connected to their inner selves.\\n\\n Well, isn't that good news??\\n\\n2. Now, just as a thought experiment, take the person who seems to you to be the most different, the most distant person from you. If you think long enough about  him / her, you surely will find a trace of every aspect of his personality within yourself too. \\n\\nThe very same fear or insecurity may turn one person into a wiseman and the other into a tyrant...That's why our personalities seem so different at first sight. But when we label those who don't seem like us as  abnormal indeed we shy away from the task of searching for the same disturbing character features within ourselves.\\n\\nI would also like to recommend a great movie called  Normal. ( With an amazing Jessica Lange and Tom Wilkinson ) There you will find a man who seems  abnormal to everybody in his life including his wife and children!  Poor guy, what a hell that must be... But in the end you will see how much you have in common with him. \\n\\nThat's why I love the movies and literature... They open you the doors to the inner lives of people whom you could never truly get to know, even if they were your neighbours, your partner or your best friend...A great book or movie has the capacity to show you every aspect of a human being. In real life you only see that what the other person allows you to see, plus what your intuition adds to it. \\n\\n( You can at least watch the trailer of the movie on youtube. Just search  for:  Normal - Trailer Jessica Lange, Tom Wilkinson. The acting is really incredible!! )\\n\\n3.  The good thing about none of us  being normal, is that when just ONE person dares to open up, be vulberable and be himself, then it helps all the people around him to liberate themselves too. There is a really wonderful example of this on a RADIOLAB podcast called  The New Normal. It is the story of Stu Rasmusen, the first trangender mayor in the US. He managed to be the mayor of a very conservative small town and change everybody's perspective about what it means to be normal! \\n\\n\\n4. And here is a remedy for all shy friends: \\n\\nYou can read Ryszard Kapuscinski's wonderful book  The Other . That can really  be a life changing experience for you. Because: what can help overcoming shyness more than realising that there is NO other?\\nWe sometimes exaggerate our differences in order to  confirm our identity and feel ourselves more special. But we must indeed do the opposite: we must always deliberately look for what we have in common. It would be helpful to have these simple lines always in mind:\\n\\n You are human beings nonetheless.\\n As far as one can see\\n Of the same species as myself \\n\\n( Pozzo, in Samuel Beckett's Waiting for Godot )\\n\\nThanks a lot for this very consoling lesson and for the truly wonderful animation!",1,1

TSxt2_QM4N4,"For all of you who think that cultural appropriation is okay, it's not. \\nThe reason is that not all hairstyles have a deep meaning in it. I've searched the internet, and when someone asked this African descent what dreadlocks meant to her, she said, They are beautiful. To me when I see them, they mean I am placing a value on myself high enough that I express who I am even at the risk of society's displeasure. Another person also said that, They're a journey into finding myself. They are a strong statement of freedom, irreverence and originality. \\nSo no, not just because it's becoming a 'trend' it's okay to let it pass. There is a deeper meaning to it. And even if another person from the same colour says they don't feel 'upset' or 'offended' towards the act- it is still wrong. Maybe they just don't know what it symbolizes or the history that comes along with it. And you can't just say, Oh it's okay to wear it because my friend says she isn't offended or anything. And I mean other idols wore it before too. \\nThat is a fallacy of over-generalisation. Please research about something before making thoughtless comments.",0,0

So everyone in the comments telling people to get over it, you don't have the right to. If they feel they are offended than they are. You can't tell someone how to feel. I understand completely why people get offended over other races wearing braids and dreads. When black people wear these hairstyles, people tend to look down on them and  discriminated agaisnt. But when another race does it; it is seen as edgy. That is the main issue with it. Unless you have ever been judged or discriminated agaisnt for your hairstyle then you will not know how it feels. You have no right to tell someone what they can and can't be offended by. It doesn't work that way.",0,0

TSxt2_QM4N4,"I wrote this on a few posts but.. I don't want to be a scrawny dumbass hater (I love EXO and SM artists so much) but what pisses me off is the fact that WHENEVER another idol that isn't EXO wears braids for literally just like one day and never again, they get into a scandal, they get bashed, they lose fans and they get hate. They STILL get talked about even after apologising numerous times. Kai, WinWin and Lay all had braids, Kai and WinWin wore them whilst performing and they never got talked about. It seems as though it's only acceptable because it's EXO, lmao I'm sick of that shit. I know some whiny ass fans will come for me but I have the right to express my opinion. I have seen enough of and NUMEROUS reports of other idols wearing braids when it's just for a photo shoot getting hated on and being on countless news articles and when EXO or any SM artists as a matter of fact wear them it's all cool just because they have an extremely large amount of fans standing up for them. Before y'all say it's not cultural appropriation lmao first of all, I would write like 10 paragraphs for you to understand but I really don't want to waste my time on something that won't change the minds of clueless people.",0,2
4kX7iBnoivA,I for one enjoy being in a theater and not my home when watching movies of this caliber. The sound design and score through arclight cinemas Atmos sound system was the best character of the film. I'm always perplexed at reviews of movies that are too long.,0,0
4kX7iBnoivA,"Didn‚Äôt see the original yet, will probably watch it now. I‚Äôve heard to watch the final cut. 2049 was gorgeous and the best film of this decade. The score is spectacular",0,0
4kX7iBnoivA,"Blade Runner and BR2049 don't have pacing issues. In BR2049, every single scene moves the plot forward and contains important information to the next scene. Most movies these days are bloated with exposition and quick edits to make it seem like the movies moving faster but nothing of importance happens for like 30 minutes. In this movie, A LOT happens in every scene, the plot continues to build at a steady pace the entire way through, it's not slow or an issue because the scenes are just long takes that immerse you into the world and let you just breathe and take it in. That's *proper* pacing. If you say the pacing is slow or it's boring, it makes you seem kinda dumb, or your taste in film is immature and gravitates towards unimaginative crap like the MCU/Fast and Furious/Transformers movies.",0,0

4kX7iBnoivA,"I didn't really like the first Blade Runner. I like the concept and the idea behind it but the movie itself I just didn't like\\nI liked this slow burn movie a looot!  Darn well too long yes indeed.\\nThe main complaints will be.. the audio balancing and the 'BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA s. \\nIt wasn't the theater.. but the balance was just off, near the end of the movie, the SFX were just god awful loud then anyone talking is just so quiet. It was horrible when they did that.\\nSecondly and far worse for me.. the Bwahhhhs.  Dear lord. They had over 30+ scenes with bwaaahhs for the sake of  bwaaahs. Trying to be hyper dramatic or something? Every. Single. set up scene that I can remember had their own bwah. Flying over the city? Bwaah. seeing the lil hover drone shoot out towards the desert? Bwaah.  Opening of the movie? Bwaaah. They had a bwaah. then a shot of his apartment for maybe 3 mins. then another bwah. followed by the inside of the car... then another bwaaah right after that.\\nJust what the flying fuckery was going on with that?\\nLike everyone was making fun of it from that one inception movie and after that it became a funny thing to comment on.. but this one can't even make fun of. just soo many...\\n\\nso yeah... the movie itself and content I all enjoyed but some random details just annoyed the hell out of me. \\nStill i'd watch it again if someone else bought the ticket or it shows up on tv later.",0,0
4kX7iBnoivA,I hated the original the first time I watched it. But I was like 15 I think. It bored me to death. Then I rewatched the original & the directors cut back to back about 10 years later. It‚Äôs one of my favorite sci fi films. But I can understand why a lot of people don‚Äôt like it. Prolly 90% of the people I know who have seen it hate it. They say it‚Äôs too slow & boring. It‚Äôs like an old 40s noir film meets science fiction. And I love it more and more with every viewing. The directors cut not the original lol.,0,0

4kX7iBnoivA,"As I teenager I watched the original Blade Runner over and over again. Partially because I didn't understand it, partially because it was my only VHS tape, and I had a thing for Daryl Hannah.  After awhile I eventually read the short story it was based off of which was written by the guy who also inspired Total Recall.  While the film left you wondering about the humanity of it all, DADOES leaves you wondering if the communist have taken over but only half the population knows about it with dueling police departments loyal to two different governments operating in the same city at the same time.",0,0
4kX7iBnoivA,Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be doing well at the box office. Guess it's a blade runner sequel in more ways than one.,1,0
4kX7iBnoivA,"Chris, like every other critic and person that loves this flick, is stuck in nostalgia mode. I have been guilty of the same thing, ie Indy 4 and Star Wars 7. Walking out the cinema, happy to just have revisited familiar universe. But once the nostalgia wears off, you realise how flawed it actually is.\\n\\nThe cinematography and sound was amazing I'll give them that. But the plot and characters were very weak. There was no logic to the storyline, potholes big enough to drive an 18 wheel through. I wasn't disappointed, as I was never expecting much, I heard the rave reviews before had, but new most the critics same age as me, 30 something growing up with late 70s, 80s and early 90s cinema, where just viewing this mediocre flick with nostalgic eyes.\\n\\nPs Denis is one of my favourite directors at the moment. But unfortunately I think his hands were tired having RIDLEY Scott as producer. I think if Denis was left to his own device's, he would of created something special. But under RIDLEY Scott who has single handedly destroyed the Alien franchise with his latest two attempts. Just leave these classics along.",0,0
4kX7iBnoivA,"I don't get the positive reviews for this Movie. Its good, but its not great either. Like Jeremy said the pacing is bad and if you pay money for a movie to watch it you should be happy about a long movie but it didn't feel like that.\\nAlso everything was good but maybe too much. Everything was too much.\\nEven the Hans Zimmer Music Style was too much for too simple scenes, like it wanted you to feel a certain way about a shot and the Atmosphere for some sceneries was visually so strong like you should feel like this about this scene.\\nAnd characters were too much for me too. Leto was also not really needed here and I enjoyed some small characters like the Somalian Dude much more then him.\\nGosling was good but I couldn't connect with his distanced and seldomly emotional and reactive behavior. It may fit the newer replicants but compared to the old movie he nevers feel like he is in danger, because he is like Terminator in Terminator 2. The bad guy has become the good guy and will save the day against the Replicant Terminatrix.\\n\\nI can't get the detail but it was overall an unsatisfying movie for me. Too long and too much.",0,0

4kX7iBnoivA,Well done Jersey for not shying away from an insane running time. The movie could've been under 2 hours and been great. Instead it was overly long. I think it spoiled it for me,0,0
4kX7iBnoivA,"Watched the movie over the weekend, after having watched the 1982 one twice. As an animation & art enthusiast, it was absolutely breathtaking - I was sitting through the entire movie with my mouth wide open. The movie is full of haunting visuals, incredibly immersive audio & a whole lot of substance & heart. I whole-heartedly recommend watching it in a cinema, if you can, because this movie really benefits from it.",0,0
4kX7iBnoivA,"I like the old Blade Runner, but I do very much agree that the pacing in the old one and the new one are both just awful. Great ideas, philosophical questions about humanity and special effects are what makes Blade Runner important, but goodness gracious was this new one full of dull characters. The most lively character was Harrison Ford's. Ryan Gosling and Jared Leto are both phenomenal actors in my opinion, but they were both so crippled by their characters in this film. They didn't get the opportunity to showcase their talents in this one. The plot was also rather cut and dry. I respect everyone's opinion but that's just mine, and I figured I'd share it even though no one really cares.",0,0

4kX7iBnoivA,For me its a near cinematic perfection as you can get .I liked it when i first saw it on video long after its original release.I grew to love it and now its my number one movie of all time so far.I did not get to that point right away but its a film you see say hey Harrison Ford hes good lets watch it.Oooh effects intense bad guy that isnt really a simple bad guy.Later you think about the films themes and start to theorise.I watched the various cuts and you started to see more  of Ridleys original vision and then you get the final cut.This film has been like a love affair.Attraction interest mystery intrigue discovery  love.Yep im a fan no i dont have bits of the set or one of Harrison Fords ties.Idont go to comicon dressed as one of the characters.I just love the film,0,0
4kX7iBnoivA,"This movie seriously sucked, I don't understand what the hype is about. The story barely chugs along and is way too predictable. Then there are several moments that to arrive at a destination in the plot, the story negates all logic to get there. The audio was completely out of place and sounded like a speaker was being unplugged (staticy). Ryan Gosling was awful, zero emotion. Granted he didn't play his usual smug/prick self that he usually does, but he really was just reading dialogue. But the worst part about this (outside of the 3 hr run time of boredom) is that it wants you to think that it is incredibly deep, thought provoking and artsy. The reality is that this film is shallow, predictable and generic; making it feel completely pretentious. During my screening, the guy next to me feel asleep and several people walked out. Please save your money.",0,0
4kX7iBnoivA,"I've tried watching the original (final cut) twice, can't get through it. Saw 2049 in IMAX yesterday. I dozed off in the first 20 minutes and then a Nolan-esque bass sound woke me up.

4kX7iBnoivA,"Love first BR. This was better then I expected, but still kinda meh .. main thing - no music. First is all about music for me. It's more like LP.

I don't feel like watching it ever again.",0,0
4kX7iBnoivA,SO glad that the thing attatched to the plot with the unicorn is kept subtle. Every single time I watched this trailer I kept saying to the person next to me : But this can't be canon because unicorn!! Damn glad unicorn is still as vague as ever.,0,0
4kX7iBnoivA,This movie is the new benchmark for cinematography and effects. It just looks breathtaking in every scene and the cgi is simply amazing.

4kX7iBnoivA,"I didn't watch the previous BladeRunner, but I did watch this one, Have to say the lore and story behind felt confusing at times, and overwhelming at others. \\nbut overall I did enjoy the movie from an experience perspective, and surely I can tell that it is an amazing film, especially to those who are fans of the first",1,0

4kX7iBnoivA,Will there be a sequel,0,0
4kX7iBnoivA,"So to answer your question: Yes, it is absolutely possible to be a fan of this movie, even though you are not a fan of the original! I was born in 1995 and even though I really liked the story and concept of the original Blade Runner movie, I just couldn't stand the aesthetics of it. The whole visual style just made me feel so uncomfortable while watching it (kind of similar to the movie Brasil) that I couldn't enjoy it as a whole. That is to say I aknowledge, that it was a very groundbreaking movie that deserves the many fans it has, just for me personally it was not as enjoyable! \\nNow Blade Runner 2049 brought the same qualities as described before just with a different, more modern visual style. So now that I could actually not only stand looking at it without feeling uncomfortable, but actually be amazed and stunned by the imigary, I was just blown away by this movie! \\nSo I love this movie and I think it is very unfortunate, that I can't enjoy the first Blade Runner the way it would deserve it!",0,0

Some nerdy things i loved was the typography and the whole concept design of the city and the futuristic world.

It took 20 years to finally watch it all the way through to the end and even then I started checking my phone and web surfing during the dull parts. I did a lot of surfing. But this movie, I was totally into. There was just one time I almost dosed a little and that was during a quiet moment in between Zimmer's new BWAHs score ,plus my theater now has these comfy recliners.

G0cDl-vZKkg,"Hi guys!! Will be starting Accutane on Oct 12 (assuming all goes well with lab results on the 11th) and will be having the acne story video coming the following week! I'll be documenting each month on Accutane & filming update videos, etc. This video was pre-filmed, so I ended up being able to get about 2 months of Foundation Friday videos pre-filmed in time before starting Accutane- yay! xx",1274,131

G0cDl-vZKkg,"Good luck with accutane ! Very exciting ,, I did it 13 years ago when I was 20,, was the last and final resort I had cystic acne also..I did six months yea the nausea was hard but was worth it . My skin has never flared up since just hormonal flare up for thag time of the month. And I do agree ur skin does switch to dry my skin is very very dry . But I have no regrets ,, good luck on your progress . You will love ur results. Don't give up everyone is different . It helped me. The first week or so is hard you will flare up cuz it's bringing everything to the surface and yes you will be dry and your lips will crack but remember it's temporary ! It will pass stay strong and don't give up and finish your treatment fully üòä",0,0

G0cDl-vZKkg,"I did about 3 months of accutane when I was 19, about 4 years ago. The prescribing dermatologist recommended that I use cetaphil/cerave face wash, a good moisturizer, and CHAPSTICK. Tayla, my lips were constantly peeling. My acne was pretty well gone in three months and I only struggle with hormonal break outs monthly now (they are very minimal). I am so excited that you get to do this, I hope it works well for you and enjoy the results! I think I was still able to wear foundation during accutane, so I hope you can, too, if you want to! <3 <3",0,0

G0cDl-vZKkg,"I had bought these foundations in desperation to find great coverage for my skin color. Also cuz tati raved about it.

G0cDl-vZKkg,Hi Taylor. This isn't makeup related and I know you don't like to make personal videos but I was wondering if you have any remedies or suggestions for my sister's migraines. She got a really bad one today and I feel so bad not being able to help her.,0,0
G0cDl-vZKkg,Glad to see a negative review on this foundation. I have combo skin. No breakouts or issues typical combo. I tried this so many times before I tossed. It looked like crap around my nose. Made my pores look huge no matter what primer and broke down in my t zone.,0,0

G0cDl-vZKkg,"i wish ypu well with your treatment. my daughter did the Accutane treatment. it worked but only temporarily and her skin was incredibly sensitive- even the skin on her hands. out of absolute desperation, she finally went oil free vegan, eating veg, fruit, seeds, nuts, and grains. bingo....took about 2 months, but she's nearly flawless now.",0,0
G0cDl-vZKkg,You have beautiful eyes,0,0
G0cDl-vZKkg,Bummer you didn't like this foundation... It's my favorite drug store full-coverage foundation for my combo/dry skin.  I always set it with translucent powder and a setting spray... but it wears all day for me until I take it off.,0,0

G0cDl-vZKkg,"Makeup is great and all but I think it does more harm than good. Sure it may cover up what you believe to be major imperfections but it damages the skin even more. \\n\\nHonestly I‚Äôd suggest to women that use makeup to first drink at least a gallon of water a day, wear sunscreen in the morning, try not to eat foods that are really oily, and moisturize after your bath/shower. It‚Äôs troubling to see what some women have to go through everyday to feel confident in themselves. \\n\\nIt may sound cliche but guys appreciate it when women don‚Äôt wear makeup.

Very exciting ,, I did it 13 years ago when I was 20,, was the last and final resort I had cystic acne also..I did six months yea the nausea was hard but was worth it . My skin has never flared up since just hormonal flare up for thag time of the month. And I do agree ur skin does switch to dry my skin is very very dry . But I have no regrets ,, good luck on your progress . You will love ur results. Don't give up everyone is different . It helped me. The first week or so is hard you will flare up cuz it's bringing everything to the surface and yes you will be dry and your lips will crack but remember it's temporary !

wUHWzsF_qJM,"Chloe I love this!! I think with the rigid collodion you have to layer it more (and let it dry in between the layers) to get a deeper looking scar and it's better to use on more fleshy skin like the cheeks or arm or where the skin isn't as thin because it has to pucker the skin and if there's not much skin there, it's not going to create the same scar like appearance. I think as well when you paint it on with the brush it can make it look very uniform and like it's been painted on unlike a scar that would kind of look jagged and fucked up :) I hope that helps!! \\n\\nLove this look it's so classic but really original too!

FcPs-bMkUjo,"Okay so I have a video idea for you Casey. Can you please go through your entire makeup collection and find one certain product for each category of makeup that you recommend. Like here is what I‚Äôm trying to say. I‚Äôm looking for a full coverage foundation that you recommend the most. Can you do that video but with every single makeup product ? I feel like I‚Äôm not making any sense. You recommend a lot of foundations but I want to know your absolute favorite one so I can purchase it myself since I don‚Äôt have a very good current foundation right now at this moment. And instead of just one product like the foundation, can you go through your entire collection and pick out one product from each category like mascara, eyeliner, foundation, eyeshadow, etc. I hope you see this because it would help me personally out a lot, and I think it would help some other people too.

Like here is what I‚Äôm trying to say. I‚Äôm looking for a full coverage foundation that you recommend the most. Can you do that video but with every single makeup product ? I feel like I‚Äôm not making any sense. You recommend a lot of foundations but I want to know your absolute favorite one so I can purchase it myself since I don‚Äôt have a very good current foundation right now at this moment. And instead of just one product like the foundation, can you go through your entire collection and pick out one product from each category like mascara, eyeliner, foundation, eyeshadow, etc. I hope you see this because it would help me personally out a lot, and I think it would help some other people too. Love you Casey. Thank you & I appreciate it a lot if you end up doing this video.",0,0

Maybe even Kylo Ren??? What clues have we gotten in things like Clone Wars/Rebels that some of us aren't as familiar with? There are conflicting interpretations on what it means to bring balance to the force. Some fans seem to think it means there are equal amounts of light and dark in the galaxy, but at one point Mace Windu makes a comment that seems to equate destroying the sith with bringing balance to the force, so maybe the light itself is balance.

He is going to inhabit the center of the Force, and give these same teachings to Rey -- and eventually Ben Solo/Kylo Ren.\\n\\nSo, no, Rey is not going to join Kylo Ren -- Kylo Ren will join her.",0,0

XIQW-1JQDMA,"Why would Luke have been afraid of Yoda? Maybe because he realizes that Yoda spoke the truth... In a way. Think about it.\\n\\nLuke may not have explicitly 'gone to the dark side', but he ALSO didn't defeat the big bads the first time around. He lost his hand because he was untrained; he got his ass soundly handed to him when dealing with the emperor, before Vader stepped in and redeemed himself a little (and then died); he opened a training academy for young Force users and let in Ben, who was a secret Vader fanboy and summarily DESTROYED his life's work (AKA, he didn't spot the darkness in his nephew, even though HE IS A SKYWALKER, and your family seems to have been cursed, dude); and then, instead of helping his friends and family with their resistance movement, he ran away so he could 'go looking for the old Jedi temples'. He may not be actually evil, but he allowed evil to continue by (a) not finishing his training and learning what he could DO with his powers and (b) not actually helping out when he had the chance to redeem himself for the event he seems to consider his greatest failure.\\n\\nTL:DR - I don't think Luke is evil, but I think he might be unintentionally helping evil along with the decisions he makes, thus making him an (unintentional) 'agent of evil' as Yoda predicted.

XIQW-1JQDMA,"I have a theory, Luke says in the teaser trailer ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs time for the Jedi to end‚Äù\\nIn this trailer, I think I know why he says that. It‚Äôs because every Jedi he has trained in one way became evil. Kylo Ren becomes evil (obviously) and Rey hasn‚Äôt became evil yet, but in this trailer, Luke does mention Rey‚Äôs power, and how he‚Äôs seen it before, and wasn‚Äôt afraid, but now he is. Luke sees this and is thinking that this is a sign of Rey ending up joining the dark side.

He says he wasn't scared of it enough before, like when he tossed his lightsaber aside in front of him, only to be tortured by his force Lightning. But he is afraid of it now, because he felt the emperor's true power first hand. Yoda even warned Luke not to underestimate the emperor, however he did, and almost payed for that with his life. So what I'm saying is that Rey is a Palpatine. Luke wasn't scared of that raw power before, but he is fearful of it now. That also makes sense why Luke would be hesitant to train her, knowing the huge connection she has to the dark side and knowing the potential destruction it could unleash, in the hands of the emperor, who was Luke's mortal enemy. It also explains Rey's massive force power, if she is related to the most powerful Sith Lord ever.",1,0

I left my house at 8 am and did not return home till midnight and you know what, other than very mild smearing under my eyes, it was totally intact as if I just did it and I did NO touch ups and it was even a rainy day.

And, I don‚Äôt believe he refused to be released. Last time I checked, that‚Äôs not an option for a prisoner. If they say you go, you go. Thousands of hero‚Äôs in Vietnam never got recognized.

I used it yesterday, got SO many compliments on my makeup it was getting embarrasing but you know what really shook me?  I left my house at 8 am and did not return home till midnight and you know what, other than very mild smearing under my eyes, it was totally intact as if I just did it and I did NO touch ups and it was even a rainy day.  Worth every penny and great job so I just wanted to tell you that.",0,0

RA9gg4qBb30,"McCAIN THE HERO NEARLY SUNK AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER & KILLED 134 SAILORS       THE TRUE STORY\\n Via Lew Rockwell\\nMcCain, when a Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy was a Navy pilot (they call themselves aviators). July 29, 1967 while on the deck and in his plane on the carrier U.S.S. Forrestal he managed to screw up procedures (officially denied and covered up by him and the Navy and also even promoted on Wikipedia if you care to look‚Äìreason to follow). He did a smart ass punk attention getting trick by doing a ‚Äúwet start‚Äù up of his jet.\\n\\nWhen a pilot wants to be a wise ass or show off, this type of engine start creates a large startling flame and lots of surprise noise from the rear of a jet engine on start up‚Äìthis was no accident. This and the large subsequent electrical surge and apparent (incorrect and against policy) weapon arming (by the pilot) caused the launching of a powerful Zuni rocket across the carrier‚Äôs deck hitting other parked planes (photo below) that were packing 1,000 high-explosive pound bombs. The subsequent massive explosions, fire and destruction went several decks below and nearly sunk this major 82,000 ton U.S. aircraft carrier.\\n\\n0\\n\\nThis stunt and aftermath caused the death of 134 sailors and seriously injure (blow off arms legs, cause blindness and burns to another 161 sailors) and took the ship off the battle line for extensive repairs. Any other Navy pilot causing this type of death and destruction the Navy would have raped him and he would probably still be in the brig. Why not McCain? Well, first with many powerful connections this ‚Äúlittle infraction‚Äù was covered up by the Navy (our most politically involved/connected service by the way).\\n\\nYou see his grandfather was a famous FOUR STAR Navy admiral and his dad was at the time of the incident was a powerful Navy FOUR STAR admiral and McCain graduated from the Navy Academy. So the old boy Navy tradition cover his ass network went into high gear immediately; and make no mistake, it does exist and it did for him.",0,0

RA9gg4qBb30,"Yep John Mccain is pretty much a bad***! I have been a fan of his for awhile now and what he is saying and doing now as senator is absolutely awesome and inspiring. In 2008 I became very interested in politics, for me that was a great election year because I believed we had two great candidates. In 2008 I ended up voting for Obama because his message and policies resonated with me. I still think back to the 2000 election, what if John McCain won? Imagine how different would the country would have been. Just 2 years after my 2008 vote McCain was up for reelection in Arizona.  McCain was up against a hard right joke of a candidate, Hayworth in the 2010 Republican Senate Primaries. I literally switched my political parties so that I could vote for McCain in the 2010 Republican Senate Primaries against a hard right joke of a candidate, Hayworth. I am glad I voted the way I did and I am glad that McCain is still a senator who stands up to Trump. His pivotal vote against the awful healthcare bill demonstrates that John McCain is a man of courage and conviction. His vote saved millions of people from losing their healthcare insurance and possibly saved thousands of people's lives from certain death if they were to lose their insurance...My mother being one of them. Thank you John McCain for all of your sacrifice and service. You are an amazing and inspiring human being.",2,0

Kylo and Rey don't switch sides, they both get convinced to fight for a reason.Kylo  has pain from being a Sith in training so Uncle Luke, who has read Sith training books (in a tree bookcase),trains Kylo to be a grey Jedi using Sith and Jedi  force techniques.

They also say the same line to a Jedi they both hope to swing to the dark, fulfill your destiny. Maybe snoke could be trying to train a new pupil after Luke failed him, or maybe he could be talking to Luke, and trying to finish what he stared as palpatine all those years ago.",0,0

Kylo Ren becomes evil (obviously) and Rey hasn‚Äôt became evil yet, but in this trailer, Luke does mention Rey‚Äôs power, and how he‚Äôs seen it before, and wasn‚Äôt afraid, but now he is.

So i met this old couple about 2 weeks ago at the park. It was the cutest old man and his wife and he was helping her walk. He told how theyd been married for 45 years and that he had never regretted a moment spent together. His wife's health had been detereorating recently and she was having trouble walking. He said he couldn't see himself without her, so he was spending every moment he could with her. She was so sweet and fragile and it was so heart warming seeing how much they cared about each other after so many years. I hope you guys enjoy my little tribute to them. .",0,0

RA9gg4qBb30,"McCAIN THE HERO NEARLY SUNK AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER & KILLED 134 SAILORS       THE TRUE STORY\\n Via Lew Rockwell\\nMcCain, when a Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy was a Navy pilot (they call themselves aviators). July 29, 1967 while on the deck and in his plane on the carrier U.S.S. Forrestal he managed to screw up procedures (officially denied and covered up by him and the Navy and also even promoted on Wikipedia if you care to look‚Äìreason to follow). He did a smart ass punk attention getting trick by doing a ‚Äúwet start‚Äù up of his jet.\\n\\nWhen a pilot wants to be a wise ass or show off, this type of engine start creates a large startling flame and lots of surprise noise from the rear of a jet engine on start up‚Äìthis was no accident. This and the large subsequent electrical surge and apparent (incorrect and against policy) weapon arming (by the pilot) caused the launching of a powerful Zuni rocket across the carrier‚Äôs deck hitting other parked planes (photo below) that were packing 1,000 high-explosive pound bombs. The subsequent massive explosions, fire and destruction went several decks below and nearly sunk this major 82,000 ton U.S. aircraft carrier.\\n\\n0\\n\\nThis stunt and aftermath caused the death of 134 sailors and seriously injure (blow off arms legs, cause blindness and burns to another 161 sailors) and took the ship off the battle line for extensive repairs. Any other Navy pilot causing this type of death and destruction the Navy would have raped him and he would probably still be in the brig. Why not McCain? Well, first with many powerful connections this ‚Äúlittle infraction‚Äù was covered up by the Navy (our most politically involved/connected service by the way).\\n\\nYou see his grandfather was a famous FOUR STAR Navy admiral and his dad was at the time of the incident was a powerful Navy FOUR STAR admiral and McCain graduated from the Navy Academy. So the old boy Navy tradition cover his ass network went into high gear immediately; and make no mistake, it does exist and it did for him.",1,0

RA9gg4qBb30,"Yep John Mccain is pretty much a bad***! I have been a fan of his for awhile now and what he is saying and doing now as senator is absolutely awesome and inspiring. In 2008 I became very interested in politics, for me that was a great election year because I believed we had two great candidates. In 2008 I ended up voting for Obama because his message and policies resonated with me. I still think back to the 2000 election, what if John McCain won? Imagine how different would the country would have been. Just 2 years after my 2008 vote McCain was up for reelection in Arizona.  McCain was up against a hard right joke of a candidate, Hayworth in the 2010 Republican Senate Primaries. I literally switched my political parties so that I could vote for McCain in the 2010 Republican Senate Primaries against a hard right joke of a candidate, Hayworth. I am glad I voted the way I did and I am glad that McCain is still a senator who stands up to Trump. His pivotal vote against the awful healthcare bill demonstrates that John McCain is a man of courage and conviction. His vote saved millions of people from losing their healthcare insurance and possibly saved thousands of people's lives from certain death if they were to lose their insurance...My mother being one of them. Thank you John McCain for all of your sacrifice and service. You are an amazing and inspiring human being.",3,0

I would understand if the mother wasn't speaking English, but this is not the case. Also, being a hearing impaired person with two hearing aids, I can tell you the the baby's reaction might be due to the volume being too loud and/or not calibrated properly for the infant. I know that when I got my first hearing aid, it was so bad that I had to take it out until they adjusted it properly. It must be very difficult to do this for a baby.

S44YKdc3G3U,"A lot of people are curious about North Korea and if people there could calm down, stop worrying so much about the west trying to take over/war they would be very prosperous from tourism alone comparably and their influence would grow considerably. Heavy handed threats that endanger everybody concerns everybody even allies often. This happened with the us with clearer cut ethical rights/wrongs during war times and the threats weren‚Äôt at the same scale. Nukes genuinely aren‚Äôt necessary for Kim to maintain his power and likely actually pose more threat to his continued rule than most other issues. If there is almost anybody in history that should hate the us it‚Äôs probably me for a number of reasons. Frankly idk why Kim wouldn‚Äôt use them if he has them because nobody seems to be capable of any logic in the us. They‚Äôre constantly attacking and trying to discredit even their most productive citizens. Just read the us funding levels. For a capitalist nation nobody appears to be very good at even the most basic math when it comes to their accounting, investments. Practically just burning billions of dollars of GDP per day for no discernible reason. Really quite embarrassing.

We have not seen this kind of malignant power since the doctors in Nazi Germany. No one alive now really can speak in a manner that we can understand about the horrors we potentially face as the result of Trump's antics.  I believe we have never faced the kind of danger we face with Trump in our lifetime. We do not understand experientially the realities of the kind of horror this Trump makes possible, such as a complete denial of climate change, and the threat of nuclear war.

RA9gg4qBb30,"McCAIN THE HERO NEARLY SUNK AN AIRCRAFT CARRIER & KILLED 134 SAILORS       THE TRUE STORY\\n Via Lew Rockwell\\nMcCain, when a Lieutenant Commander in the U.S. Navy was a Navy pilot (they call themselves aviators). July 29, 1967 while on the deck and in his plane on the carrier U.S.S. Forrestal he managed to screw up procedures (officially denied and covered up by him and the Navy and also even promoted on Wikipedia if you care to look‚Äìreason to follow). He did a smart ass punk attention getting trick by doing a ‚Äúwet start‚Äù up of his jet.\\n\\nWhen a pilot wants to be a wise ass or show off, this type of engine start creates a large startling flame and lots of surprise noise from the rear of a jet engine on start up‚Äìthis was no accident. This and the large subsequent electrical surge and apparent (incorrect and against policy) weapon arming (by the pilot) caused the launching of a powerful Zuni rocket across the carrier‚Äôs deck hitting other parked planes (photo below) that were packing 1,000 high-explosive pound bombs. The subsequent massive explosions, fire and destruction went several decks below and nearly sunk this major 82,000 ton U.S. aircraft carrier.\\n\\n0\\n\\nThis stunt and aftermath caused the death of 134 sailors and seriously injure (blow off arms legs, cause blindness and burns to another 161 sailors) and took the ship off the battle line for extensive repairs. Any other Navy pilot causing this type of death and destruction the Navy would have raped him and he would probably still be in the brig. Why not McCain? Well, first with many powerful connections this ‚Äúlittle infraction‚Äù was covered up by the Navy (our most politically involved/connected service by the way).\\n\\nYou see his grandfather was a famous FOUR STAR Navy admiral and his dad was at the time of the incident was a powerful Navy FOUR STAR admiral and McCain graduated from the Navy Academy. So the old boy Navy tradition cover his ass network went into high gear immediately; and make no mistake, it does exist and it did for him.",1,0

He threw the 2008 Presidential election putting Barak Obama in the White House. He even turned on his running mate, Sarah Palin.

RA9gg4qBb30,"Yep John Mccain is pretty much a bad***! I have been a fan of his for awhile now and what he is saying and doing now as senator is absolutely awesome and inspiring. In 2008 I became very interested in politics, for me that was a great election year because I believed we had two great candidates. In 2008 I ended up voting for Obama because his message and policies resonated with me. I still think back to the 2000 election, what if John McCain won? Imagine how different would the country would have been. Just 2 years after my 2008 vote McCain was up for reelection in Arizona.  McCain was up against a hard right joke of a candidate, Hayworth in the 2010 Republican Senate Primaries. I literally switched my political parties so that I could vote for McCain in the 2010 Republican Senate Primaries against a hard right joke of a candidate, Hayworth. I am glad I voted the way I did and I am glad that McCain is still a senator who stands up to Trump. His pivotal vote against the awful healthcare bill demonstrates that John McCain is a man of courage and conviction. His vote saved millions of people from losing their healthcare insurance and possibly saved thousands of people's lives from certain death if they were to lose their insurance...My mother being one of them. Thank you John McCain for all of your sacrifice and service. You are an amazing and inspiring human being.",3,0

I know that when I got my first hearing aid, it was so bad that I had to take it out until they adjusted it properly. It must be very difficult to do this for a baby.

This happened with the us with clearer cut ethical rights/wrongs during war times and the threats weren‚Äôt at the same scale. Nukes genuinely aren‚Äôt necessary for Kim to maintain his power and likely actually pose more threat to his continued rule than most other issues. If there is almost anybody in history that should hate the us it‚Äôs probably me for a number of reasons. Frankly idk why Kim wouldn‚Äôt use them if he has them because nobody seems to be capable of any logic in the us. They‚Äôre constantly attacking and trying to discredit even their most productive citizens. Just read the us funding levels. For a capitalist nation nobody appears to be very good at even the most basic math when it comes to their accounting, investments. Practically just burning billions of dollars of GDP per day for no discernible reason. Really quite embarrassing.

Trump sees the world through his distorted and non-empathic sense of Self, an infantile self. He normalizes malignant harm. Many serious thinkers in the world of psychology are quite concerned. We have not seen this kind of malignant power since the doctors in Nazi Germany. No one alive now really can speak in a manner that we can understand about the horrors we potentially face as the result of Trump's antics.  I believe we have never faced the kind of danger we face with Trump in our lifetime. We do not understand experientially the realities of the kind of horror this Trump makes possible, such as a complete denial of climate change, and the threat of nuclear war.

He threw the 2008 Presidential election putting Barak Obama in the White House. He even turned on his running mate, Sarah Palin.

RA9gg4qBb30,"Yep John Mccain is pretty much a bad***! I have been a fan of his for awhile now and what he is saying and doing now as senator is absolutely awesome and inspiring. In 2008 I became very interested in politics, for me that was a great election year because I believed we had two great candidates. In 2008 I ended up voting for Obama because his message and policies resonated with me. I still think back to the 2000 election, what if John McCain won? Imagine how different would the country would have been. Just 2 years after my 2008 vote McCain was up for reelection in Arizona.  McCain was up against a hard right joke of a candidate, Hayworth in the 2010 Republican Senate Primaries. I literally switched my political parties so that I could vote for McCain in the 2010 Republican Senate Primaries against a hard right joke of a candidate, Hayworth. I am glad I voted the way I did and I am glad that McCain is still a senator who stands up to Trump. His pivotal vote against the awful healthcare bill demonstrates that John McCain is a man of courage and conviction. His vote saved millions of people from losing their healthcare insurance and possibly saved thousands of people's lives from certain death if they were to lose their insurance...My mother being one of them.

Trump sees the world through his distorted and non-empathic sense of Self, an infantile self. He normalizes malignant harm. Many serious thinkers in the world of psychology are quite concerned. We have not seen this kind of malignant power since the doctors in Nazi Germany. No one alive now really can speak in a manner that we can understand about the horrors we potentially face as the result of Trump's antics.  I believe we have never faced the kind of danger we face with Trump in our lifetime. We do not understand experientially the realities of the kind of horror this Trump makes possible, such as a complete denial of climate change, and the threat of nuclear war.

By a large margin, the general public wants to see taxes on corporations and the wealthy go up, not down; even Republicans are divided, with only a modest margin in favor of cuts.\\n\\nOne thing we know for sure, however, is that a great majority of Republican politicians know perfectly well that their party is lying about its tax plan ‚Äî and every even halfway competent economist aligned with the party definitely understands what‚Äôs going on.\\n\\nWhat this means is that everyone who goes along with this plan, or even remains silent in the face of the campaign of mass dissimulation, is complicit ‚Äî is in effect an accomplice to the most dishonest political selling job in American history.",0,0

RA9gg4qBb30,"Yep John Mccain is pretty much a bad***! I have been a fan of his for awhile now and what he is saying and doing now as senator is absolutely awesome and inspiring. In 2008 I became very interested in politics, for me that was a great election year because I believed we had two great candidates. In 2008 I ended up voting for Obama because his message and policies resonated with me. I still think back to the 2000 election, what if John McCain won? Imagine how different would the country would have been. Just 2 years after my 2008 vote McCain was up for reelection in Arizona.  McCain was up against a hard right joke of a candidate, Hayworth in the 2010 Republican Senate Primaries. I literally switched my political parties so that I could vote for McCain in the 2010 Republican Senate Primaries against a hard right joke of a candidate, Hayworth. I am glad I voted the way I did and I am glad that McCain is still a senator who stands up to Trump. His pivotal vote against the awful healthcare bill demonstrates that John McCain is a man of courage and conviction. His vote saved millions of people from losing their healthcare insurance and possibly saved thousands of people's lives from certain death if they were to lose their insurance...My mother being one of them. Thank you John McCain for all of your sacrifice and service. You are an amazing and inspiring human being.",3,0

n530GFrdPY8,"can we all come together as one and all universally decree that this song should be a #1 hit instead of lame ass bro country Kane Brown, Jason Aldean and Brantley Gilbert?\\nCountry Radio is killing country music. We need to kick bro country turds out of country music and bring back Brad Paisley, Alan Jackson, George Strait, Josh Turner, Joe Nichols and William Michael Morgan to the top of the charts!\\nIt's a damn shame that Missing by WMM only peaked at #29, Never Gets Old by Joe Nichols peaked at #56 and Last Time for Everything by Brad Paisley stalled at #19. Meanwhile we have meaningless crap like Bottoms Up and The Weekend by Gilbert, Lights Come On, Dirt Road Anthem and Burnin it Down by Aldean topping the charts. FUCK YOU COUNTRY RADIO",4,11

n530GFrdPY8,Brad Paisley is about as southern as Boston cream pie....he was born and grew up in the northern most part of West Virginia....up in the spike between Ohio and Pennsylvania... I dig his songs but parlaying himself as a southern musician is funny..Brad & Keith Urban an Australian are kindred spirits....,1,0
