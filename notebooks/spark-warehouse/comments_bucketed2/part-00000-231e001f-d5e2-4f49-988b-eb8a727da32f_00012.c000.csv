But I grew up before cell phones and the wide adoption of the web so I can see the difference. What about kids who are born today, into the age of the smartphone? I'm worried that they won't have the foresight or the will to be able to use self-discipline and abstinence before its to late. I also think that the issue is to complex to be left solely to the parents. We need to do some research and establish the facts. The modern world us becoming so complex that the old school model of only teaching facts and classic subjects isn't enough, we also need some life skills and philosophy.",0,0

Instead of the normal stereoscopic 120 degrees of vision, people condition themselves to be focused on barely 5 degrees of screen in front of them. This generates a whole slew of awkward problems.

LDcm6twPEJA,"When you look back in your life and remember the happiest moments, do they all have something in common? I thought that probably for most of us,  those were the moments where we felt totally absorbed in something we loved to do, to a point where we forgot about time and about ourselves and everything around ..Like when you get lost in a book, in a piece of music you play or when you feel one with the nature. Or when you get into a deep conversation with a friend, watch a great movie or  a concert...  You get into a kind of flow. \\n\\nI don't have a smart phone, because I thought it would constantly bring me back to the surface.  And surface is absolutely the place where you suffer the most! Imagine all the situations I described above: A phone that makes strange noises at any unexpected moment would ruin it all. \\n\\nWell I don't mean to offend anyone, this is just a personal thing and I confess that I have a total  obsession with silence and my phone is turned off 99 percent of the time. \\n\\nBut here is a quote by Nietzsche that is worth keeping ALWAYS  in mind: \\n\\nThe greatest events  of our lives - they are not our loudest but our stillest hours‚Äù\\n\\n Imagine that you have your favourite cake in front of you. But if you get lost in some thoughts while eating it, you may suddenly realise that the cake is gone!  You just ate it without even noticing it! ( It happened to me more than once with all sorts of muffins! :- ) \\n\\n If we spend our counted days on earth with constant distraction, in the end,  we may feel this way about our lives  ... We won't know where it  has gone...\\n\\nAs T. S. Eliot said: \\n\\nWe get  distracted from distraction by distraction. \\n\\nThat's the greatest danger.\\n\\nI don't mean to sound too dark though. Of course you can have the latest smart phone, in case you REALLY need it, and if you know exactly what you want from it, you can use it properly.\\n\\nFor friends who want to think more on this issue here is a little list: \\n\\n1. There is a TED Talk by Adam Alter called: \\n\\n Why our screens make us less happy. \\n\\n He is a psychologist and professor at NYU and he says that he himself was \\naddicted to his phone and to gaming. Imagine! :- ) That motivated him to write the following book: \\n\\n Irresistible: The Rise of Addictive Technology and The Business of \\nKeeping Us Hooked. \\n\\n2. There is a very interesting  Note to Self podcast episode called: \\n\\n What is our attention actually worth \\n\\nIt can be helpful if you want to re-think your relationship with your phone. \\n\\n3. There is a TED Talk by the  ethical design thinker Tristan Harris called: \\n\\nHow better tech could protect us from distraction\\n\\n4.  I haven't read this one but Shery Turkle from MIT has a book on the issue called:\\n\\n Alone Together, Why we expect more from Techonology and Less From Each Other. \\n\\nYou can also watch her TED talk:\\n\\n Connected, but alone ?\\n\\nThanks for this wonderful lesson and for the amazing animation!",0,0

But I grew up before cell phones and the wide adoption of the web so I can see the difference. What about kids who are born today, into the age of the smartphone? I'm worried that they won't have the foresight or the will to be able to use self-discipline and abstinence before its to late. I also think that the issue is to complex to be left solely to the parents. We need to do some research and establish the facts. The modern world us becoming so complex that the old school model of only teaching facts and classic subjects isn't enough, we also need some life skills and philosophy.",0,0

xmhRIEqbKIY,"When I was 4 years old..I'd already become aware of the fact I loved football. Probably because my father & brothers did, and they were my heroes growing up . One day my older brother decided it was time for me to pick a favorite NFL team. (I've lived in Oxford, Mississippi my entire life so Ole Miss was my college team from my very first breath)  A few weeks after, I was still trying to choose. Then I saw Barry Sanders run for the 1st time, and even at such a young age, I realized what I was seeing was something truly unique & special. I've loved the Detroit Lions from that moment, and I will love the Detroit Lions until the day I die. \\n\\nIts been INCREDIBLY difficult being a Lions fan over the last 25 years, as ANY other Lions fans will no doubt tell you. Much less a fan from Mississippi. From my childhood hero, Barry Sanders, sudden retierment, to losing every game at Lambeau Field for 20 years straight, all the way through the cancer known as GM Matt Millen and the 0-16 year. But there's something about this year's team that just feels different to me. Excellent QB, great WR'S AND TE, solid offense and defensive lines, competent coaching, as well as FINALLY having a couple of really good RB's. I'll be damned, but we may actually have a shot this year? Maybe we don't. Either way, ill be here in Mississippi rooting my ass off for them!",0,0

uqoFsqOJYCg,"Bottom line is, we are all on some level racist. It stems from our ancestors being wary of different looking-acting tribes. Tribalism \\n\\nIt takes more energy to think about this and try not to be racist than it does to fold to your basic evolutionary impulses. (The reason racism is so prevalent: *laziness* )",0,0
uqoFsqOJYCg,"Prepare the TL;DR\\nMany are using the fact that slavery ended 200 yrs ago (though it was really ~150) to refute what blue shirt girl is saying... I disagree with her, but that rebuttal isn't accurate considering Jim Crow Laws promptly followed slavery, were intended to keep blacks (and others) legally oppressed, and didn't end until the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. Even then you had things like the War on Drugs in the 80s to follow it. \\n\\nSo it's really been closer to 40-60 yrs that the playing field has been leveled (which is difficult to formally quantify/prove). Considering most typically aren't fully established, comfortably out of debt, or able to pay their progress forward UNTIL they're in their 40's or older, and that it often takes more than 1 generation to cement the stability following it on an societal level... The idea that there aren't still some inequalities or problems now as far as income, education accessibility and corresponding opportunity by socioeconomic status (tied to race for the aforementioned reasons) isn't far-fetched. \\n\\nI acknowledge issues of racism, racial bias, and privilege, can be hard to indefinitely prove because everything is relative. Things one may find racist or hurtful, even a microaggression, others may not. Even those of the same race. Much of it involves interpretation, experience, the outlook, and world view you bring to the table. People can look at the exact same facts about race and draw VERY different conclusions. \\n\\nThis isn't to dismiss the idea of privilege or racism. But just to ask that everyone respect each other's views. Seriously. Everybody calm the fuck down, okay? Name calling doesn't change people's opinions. You have to get to the ROOT of the person's reasoning. For her it's guilt. It doesn't matter WHY she feels guilty or if you agree with it. If you want her to stop indirectly blaming YOU for being racist (because that's why you're getting defensive and triggered) THAT'S what you'll have to address. Granted, most of us are just here to passive aggressively pass the time, not make actual change. But this complacency is the problem. Because NONE of you would likely be willing to have a level-headed conversation about these issues to anyone's face. You'd shut down, twiddle your thumbs, make judgments and assumptions about those around you. And then resort to name calling behind their backs online. That doesn't solve anything. \\n\\nI have my beliefs, my interpretations. Others may not always agree. I can find it frustrating. But what's more important to me is not that someone sees the world as I do, but that they just respect my views. And me as a human being. I don't care if you believe in words like microagressions. But if I ask you not to touch my hair without permission, whistle at me on the street or harass me because of my outfit, and you respect that, that's all that matters. I'm not going to call you racist for being White, even for disagreeing with me. And I hope you treat me the same way. I hope you won't treat anyone else like many of you are the girl in the Blue shirt. Karma's a bitch. And I don't think you'll look forward to the day it happens to you.",0,0

I think because over here (I am from Canada) we are way too focus that we don't have time for anything and fast-food is just a quick way to get food. So that might be the reasons.

Slim children simply are far less likely to deal with weight problems later on so it's critical to start with a foundation of health for kids at school and home. I don't think American public schools are really studying other healthy country's school menus and trying to understand why they are the way they are. Instead they rely on their own ideas of nutrition which is often boring like salads. Fast food in America often does the same thing.... offer delicious hamburgers & fries... or a pitiful salad, misleading people to believe nutritious food is boring and gross. Although they have been improving on this somewhat in recent years by offering more nutritious options and banning trans fats.",0,0

Tribalism \\n\\nIt takes more energy to think about this and try not to be racist than it does to fold to your basic evolutionary impulses. (The reason racism is so prevalent: *laziness* )",0,0
uqoFsqOJYCg,"Prepare the TL;DR\\nMany are using the fact that slavery ended 200 yrs ago (though it was really ~150) to refute what blue shirt girl is saying... I disagree with her, but that rebuttal isn't accurate considering Jim Crow Laws promptly followed slavery, were intended to keep blacks (and others) legally oppressed, and didn't end until the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s. Even then you had things like the War on Drugs in the 80s to follow it. \\n\\nSo it's really been closer to 40-60 yrs that the playing field has been leveled (which is difficult to formally quantify/prove). Considering most typically aren't fully established, comfortably out of debt, or able to pay their progress forward UNTIL they're in their 40's or older, and that it often takes more than 1 generation to cement the stability following it on an societal level... The idea that there aren't still some inequalities or problems now as far as income, education accessibility and corresponding opportunity by socioeconomic status (tied to race for the aforementioned reasons) isn't far-fetched. \\n\\nI acknowledge issues of racism, racial bias, and privilege, can be hard to indefinitely prove because everything is relative. Things one may find racist or hurtful, even a microaggression, others may not. Even those of the same race. Much of it involves interpretation, experience, the outlook, and world view you bring to the table. People can look at the exact same facts about race and draw VERY different conclusions. \\n\\nThis isn't to dismiss the idea of privilege or racism. But just to ask that everyone respect each other's views. Seriously. Everybody calm the fuck down, okay? Name calling doesn't change people's opinions. You have to get to the ROOT of the person's reasoning. For her it's guilt. It doesn't matter WHY she feels guilty or if you agree with it. If you want her to stop indirectly blaming YOU for being racist (because that's why you're getting defensive and triggered) THAT'S what you'll have to address. Granted, most of us are just here to passive aggressively pass the time, not make actual change. But this complacency is the problem. Because NONE of you would likely be willing to have a level-headed conversation about these issues to anyone's face. You'd shut down, twiddle your thumbs, make judgments and assumptions about those around you. And then resort to name calling behind their backs online. That doesn't solve anything. \\n\\nI have my beliefs, my interpretations. Others may not always agree. I can find it frustrating. But what's more important to me is not that someone sees the world as I do, but that they just respect my views. And me as a human being. I don't care if you believe in words like microagressions. But if I ask you not to touch my hair without permission, whistle at me on the street or harass me because of my outfit, and you respect that, that's all that matters. I'm not going to call you racist for being White, even for disagreeing with me. And I hope you treat me the same way. I hope you won't treat anyone else like many of you are the girl in the Blue shirt. Karma's a bitch. And I don't think you'll look forward to the day it happens to you.",0,0

On the other side, how a person is seen is very much determined by their actions.  Should they act out in the mentality of group thinking, instead of as an individual, it should be no surprise they been seen as their actions have defined them.  The answer to all of this is to act in goodness as an individual, while giving other people the opportunity to do the same.\\n\\nThe concept of racism is to take cliques to the level, where membership is assigned and exclusive to any number of physical or cultural attributes.  Nazi Germany showed the dangers of such concepts of classification based on genetic characteristics, yet we practice such classification today as if we've learned nothing.  Should we see ourselves or others as black, white, Asian, Arabic, Hispanic, etc...  I think we've failed.  It matters if we're good or evil, not what color we are.  Worry about that, forget race, and this whole problem goes away.  You can only change you.  It creates greater divide when people try to compensate for what should be left behind.  Pride or shame cannot be tied to a color, only action.",0,0

So it doesn't make sense to hang onto cash just in case when your credit card debt is subject to huge interest rates.  Better to pay off the card as much as you can--if there's an emergency, you can put money back on, but if there's not, you'll end up a lot closer to being out of debt.

It seems plain old silly to carry a balance on a card costing 12-20% interest annually, while simultaneously holding cash in a bank account yielding <1% annually. This is especially the case given that credit cards allow you to redraw upon the credit. \\n\\nIf you have a credit card balance, IMO, it's better to just pay off as much of it as possible (probably only to the point of not risking overdraft charges on other accounts), and if it's necessary to redraw on that same card, do so if necessary. \\n\\nBy keeping a cash reserve and a credit card balance, you're taking a guaranteed loss rather than risking a smaller loss.

uwukx6DGmW8,"Maybe I've just been listening to too much Bad With Money, Gabby Dunn's awesome podcast (any other fans? Hi! Hello!) about how screwed up the US financial system is, but I found one of Chelsea and Lauren's comments dismissive. The three of you answer a question about how to avoid fast food, and Chelsea and Lauren's solution is to come with an alternate driving route and cook at home. Here's the thing: not everyone has the time or money to cook at home, not to mention how pricey fruits and vegetables can be. Also, food deserts (places where there's a lack of food because it's a poor area) exist, and this disproportionately affects people of color and people who are poor. Which not only makes cooking at home basically impossible, but also means people in those areas have to rely on the few places near them with food options, and often times that means fast food, whether its from somewhere like McDonald's or food from a gas station. Also, the idea of changing your entire driving route just to avoid fast food is completely ridiculous, not to mention nearly impossible. As Hank said, the whole point of fast food is for it to be located conveniently in busy commuter areas. So all of this to say: treating money and food and access to both like it's the same for everyone completely ignores the structural barriers and systems of oppression that keep people from them.",0,1

ZW4jOlyj-sM,"Howdy guys, I've been watching your videos for quite some time now and wanted to say that you guys are great! My favorite videos are probably the ones about your cat's and the collaborations you do with other youtubers. Now, a question I'm having is can you go to Japan with an online bachelors degree? I can't go to a regular college due to medical issues I'm having right now and the online college I am looking at is WGU, they are like any other college only online. I've looked through JET and many other places but can't seem to find anything on this. I was hoping since you live in Japan and are able to read their language a lot better than I that you might be able to find something. Maybe a video could be made on this? Like where people can go to find out this kind of information and so fourth. Again, thanks for the videos and looking forward to future ones!",0,0

I know you guys are like so famous now that you'll be on MTV but  you should at least reply to your dms or the comments. Just interact more with the fans.

uwukx6DGmW8,"Regarding stopping eating fast food, I found meal planning and, adding more power to that, slow-cooking to be the best for me to tackle that problem. If you've meal-planned, you already have a plan for dinner and the ingredients at home and it's on your calendar so all the decision making is done and you know you can do it. To further that with the slow-cooker, if you started that meal in the morning, it's already done or mostly done and you aren't going to stop and grab fast food as you have to get home and check on your cooker/meal, or add the last ingredient that only cooks for 30 min (like egg noodles for chicken noodle soup). It won't matter how tired you are as there's little or no prep left and it beats sitting in line at the drivethru. Seriously, thinking about a roast in my cooker with the potatoes drenched in the drippings underneath is so much more tempting than a fast food burger when I'm hungry. \\nI find when I employ these tactics, I save hundreds of dollars a month on food (there are 5 people in my household) and tend to have my clothes fit better.\\nI think this can easily go hand in hand with Chelsea's idea of bulk cooking on a weekend for lunches or dinners throughout the week.

uwukx6DGmW8,"Okay, I hate to be that guy, but I need to make a few points before people start hopping on the  financial diet bandwagon:\\nFirst, when letting someone give you financial advice, ALWAYS question their credentials. Are these women CPAs, CFAs, or FCs? What qualifies them to give advice (even if it's free)?\\nSecond, I resent the implication that financial professionals are snake oil salesmen. Qualified financial professionals are heavily regulated. When you walk into a bank and ask for someone who can advise you about your finances, they have a legal, fiduciary responsibility to give you the best advice to reach your goals.\\n Which brings me to my third and final point: Investment banks like fidelity aren't the only game in town. When considering your options about investments, you don't HAVE to go straight to the major investment banks. You can always walk into the local branch of your bank and ask if there is someone you can talk to about investments. If your bank has branches in more than one state, they more than likely have a financial consultant on staff you can set up an appointment with.",0,0

WAKE UP & accept forgiveness of your sins through Jesus' agonizing death on the cross. He paid the price of our sins freely out of His deep LOVE for us. Man has turned from our Lord God in blatant disobedience calling evil good and good evil & we are under His judgment. He is a loving Father, but also a righteous Judge. REPENT before it's too late. You do not want to be left behind. Cry out to Jesus today & ask Him to be Lord over your life then turn from sin. If left behind you can still accept Jesus as your Savior, but you'll endure the wrath of God & Satan during the Great Tribulation which will be unfathomable. Be also forewarned to NOT take the mark of the beast (perhaps the RFID chip or bar code in righthand or forehead required to buy or sell), for those who do cannot be saved.

What is your risk vs potential gain? Compare the interest on your mortgage and average gains in the stock market (but past performance is not an indicator of future performance). Think about the chances of you meeting Harvey or Irma. \\nThings to consider when paying off the student loan\\n-there is probably going to be a time limit when the interest rate on the student loan is lower. If there is, take advantage of that and take that into an account into your calculation\\nThings to consider when buying a car\\n-I had money to buy the whole thing but I heard from places that financing it builds your credit up. I am not sure if that is true or not but I just went with it. Always do more research and think about how much of that extra credit rating will save you money on future mortgage rates\\nAs for the cryptocurrencies:\\n-any form of currency trading is as good as a gamble, and cryptocurrencies are currencies. Gold is technically not a currency nowadays, but many still treat it like as it is. Gold price is probably overvalued right now as well. If you research on how much of gold is actually used for real world value such as electronics and jewelries, it's really a tiny, tiny portion of the gold demand. That is not what is causing gold to rise in price. It's other people who treat gold as currency or a storage of value and want a stockpile of them in case the world goes into a global apocalypse or world war, so that they can chop that gold into pieces to trade food, instead of bottle caps.",0,0

Better to pay off the card as much as you can--if there's an emergency, you can put money back on, but if there's not, you'll end up a lot closer to being out of debt.

uwukx6DGmW8,"I'd have to disagree with the advice that was given to not pay off one's credit card in full if it would deplete all of one's cash reserves. It seems plain old silly to carry a balance on a card costing 12-20% interest annually, while simultaneously holding cash in a bank account yielding <1% annually. This is especially the case given that credit cards allow you to redraw upon the credit. \\n\\nIf you have a credit card balance, IMO, it's better to just pay off as much of it as possible (probably only to the point of not risking overdraft charges on other accounts), and if it's necessary to redraw on that same card, do so if necessary. \\n\\nBy keeping a cash reserve and a credit card balance, you're taking a guaranteed loss rather than risking a smaller loss.

uwukx6DGmW8,"There is very little regulation about who can advise you with your money. = Inaccurate at best, ignorant at worst.\\n\\n1) There is VERY stringent regulation in the U.S. about who can advise you. In fact, it is both federally and state-regulated, with the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 at the federal level and the Uniform Securities Act at the state level.\\n\\n2) In addition to passing a rigorous securities exam (Series 7, for which you must already be with a FINRA-member firm to even take), potential FAs must complete a very extensive Form U-4, in which you must disclose everything from a felony charge to outstanding liens on you or your past affiliations. Then you must take and pass ANOTHER exam, called the Series 66, which tests you over the very laws (including the fiduciary rule) that Miss Thang purported that don't exist.\\n\\n3) Once you jump all those hurdles, you're not out of the woods yet. On the second anniversary of your registration date, you will be required to complete continuing education, and then every three years thereafter. Failure to complete these requirements may result in revocation of your status as a registered financial advisor.\\n\\nSource: I am a financial advisor trainee going through this very process. I almost wish there were very little rules, because then I wouldn't be working 12- and 13-hour days to learn as much as I possibly can. \\n\\nBut if that were the case, then I wouldn't have the reverence that I have for my mentor, because then he could just be any ol' snake-oil salesman mountebank off the street.\\n\\nSo, no, Miss Thang.

wQD1JvJZXdI,My Note 5 had average battery life the note 4 as well so when did it have great battery life? I easily get through a day with my Note 8 and I don't really see a difference between that and the S8 plus.

That's without ever charging once.  I had to charge my iPhone at LEAST once a day by noon.\\n\\nI think the battery life is better than it gets credit for.

ZW4jOlyj-sM,"I think something to consider is westerners are bigger than Asians by default. Not in fat, but actual body mass so the required calorie intake will vary. A huge problem we have is while things may not have certain ingredients in them they get replaced by much unhealthier alternatives to both save on production and pass laws that say food should have less of say sugar. Something may not have sugar in it, but it's just replaced with high fructose corn syrup which is much worse for you. There's a lot of shady practice that goes on that allows companies to bypass laws. For example, something may say it's made in america on the box but the item says made in china. What they do is claim that the box was made in the US, but the item was manufactured in China. Good times.",0,0

ZW4jOlyj-sM,"Japan's fast food come in larger portions than Australia's, and Australia is still super high on the 'most obese' scale.

I'm 25 and I can't eat that much.\\n I found most Japanese food to be super salty or sugary. So many sugary fake cream cakes and such.",0,0

ZW4jOlyj-sM,"Howdy guys, I've been watching your videos for quite some time now and wanted to say that you guys are great! My favorite videos are probably the ones about your cat's and the collaborations you do with other youtubers. Now, a question I'm having is can you go to Japan with an online bachelors degree? I can't go to a regular college due to medical issues I'm having right now and the online college I am looking at is WGU, they are like any other college only online. I've looked through JET and many other places but can't seem to find anything on this. I was hoping since you live in Japan and are able to read their language a lot better than I that you might be able to find something. Maybe a video could be made on this? Like where people can go to find out this kind of information and so fourth. Again, thanks for the videos and looking forward to future ones!",0,0

Our country is a wonderful place, built on dreams, freedom and diversity. There are also many grave injustices in our past. Today we have a country where people can work together even if they don't look like each other. But we also live in a country where people have been being murdered by police because of the way they look. If someone wants to stand during the national anthem to appreciate the beautiful positive strengths of our nation, that is very respectable and in line with tradition. If someone wants to break tradition and kneel during the national anthem to be mindful of the real injustices of the past and present, that is also respectable. One of the greatest parts of our nation is that we are free to act however we feel, as long as we are not harming others. Now our president is telling us who to vote for and how to act. That is not American. And it is scary because a lot of people are listening to him. We need to be free to vote how we choose without a president holding rallies for candidates. We need to be free to salute our greatness, or kneel to show mindfulness of our weaknesses. Freedom is what we salute. Tradition is a valid part of society, but no one should ever be told by a president that they must follow tradition or be fired from their career. Hank, I understand that there are other things to talk about. I understand that you don't want to become part of an echo chamber. But you are a thoughtful and articulate American citizen and many people respect your voice. The world and the nation are facing some serious problems right now that could become more serious if we do not talk about them like civil respectful adults.

uwukx6DGmW8,"Regarding stopping eating fast food, I found meal planning and, adding more power to that, slow-cooking to be the best for me to tackle that problem. If you've meal-planned, you already have a plan for dinner and the ingredients at home and it's on your calendar so all the decision making is done and you know you can do it. To further that with the slow-cooker, if you started that meal in the morning, it's already done or mostly done and you aren't going to stop and grab fast food as you have to get home and check on your cooker/meal, or add the last ingredient that only cooks for 30 min (like egg noodles for chicken noodle soup). It won't matter how tired you are as there's little or no prep left and it beats sitting in line at the drivethru. Seriously, thinking about a roast in my cooker with the potatoes drenched in the drippings underneath is so much more tempting than a fast food burger when I'm hungry. \\nI find when I employ these tactics, I save hundreds of dollars a month on food (there are 5 people in my household) and tend to have my clothes fit better.\\nI think this can easily go hand in hand with Chelsea's idea of bulk cooking on a weekend for lunches or dinners throughout the week. A big slow cooker meal on Wed gives you leftovers for Thurs and Fri that you can look forward to and a nice meal mid-week to break up any monotony.",0,0

When you walk into a bank and ask for someone who can advise you about your finances, they have a legal, fiduciary responsibility to give you the best advice to reach your goals.\\n Which brings me to my third and final point: Investment banks like fidelity aren't the only game in town. When considering your options about investments, you don't HAVE to go straight to the major investment banks. You can always walk into the local branch of your bank and ask if there is someone you can talk to about investments. If your bank has branches in more than one state, they more than likely have a financial consultant on staff you can set up an appointment with.",0,0

Man has turned from our Lord God in blatant disobedience calling evil good and good evil & we are under His judgment. He is a loving Father, but also a righteous Judge. REPENT before it's too late. You do not want to be left behind. Cry out to Jesus today & ask Him to be Lord over your life then turn from sin. If left behind you can still accept Jesus as your Savior, but you'll endure the wrath of God & Satan during the Great Tribulation which will be unfathomable.

Think about the chances of you meeting Harvey or Irma. \\nThings to consider when paying off the student loan\\n-there is probably going to be a time limit when the interest rate on the student loan is lower. If there is, take advantage of that and take that into an account into your calculation\\nThings to consider when buying a car\\n-I had money to buy the whole thing but I heard from places that financing it builds your credit up. I am not sure if that is true or not but I just went with it. Always do more research and think about how much of that extra credit rating will save you money on future mortgage rates\\nAs for the cryptocurrencies:\\n-any form of currency trading is as good as a gamble, and cryptocurrencies are currencies. Gold is technically not a currency nowadays, but many still treat it like as it is. Gold price is probably overvalued right now as well. If you research on how much of gold is actually used for real world value such as electronics and jewelries, it's really a tiny, tiny portion of the gold demand. That is not what is causing gold to rise in price. It's other people who treat gold as currency or a storage of value and want a stockpile of them in case the world goes into a global apocalypse or world war, so that they can chop that gold into pieces to trade food, instead of bottle caps.",0,0

Then you must take and pass ANOTHER exam, called the Series 66, which tests you over the very laws (including the fiduciary rule) that Miss Thang purported that don't exist.\\n\\n3) Once you jump all those hurdles, you're not out of the woods yet.

This is especially the case given that credit cards allow you to redraw upon the credit. \\n\\nIf you have a credit card balance, IMO, it's better to just pay off as much of it as possible (probably only to the point of not risking overdraft charges on other accounts), and if it's necessary to redraw on that same card, do so if necessary. \\n\\nBy keeping a cash reserve and a credit card balance, you're taking a guaranteed loss rather than risking a smaller loss.

At those APL's the Note 8 is just like any other phone and very similar to the LG V30. There is no scenario of phone usage that will ever display 1200cd/m¬≤, this is a theoretical value for a picture with 1% white and 99% black - ALL OLED displays can reach super bright whites in that scenario - only DIsplayMate make such useless measurements. Just quote the 100% APL brightness or 50% like most reviewers do. Please.\\n\\nI am getting fed up of the press relaying nonsense brightness figures without understanding them! If you use your web browser in the sun, the white on a Youtube page would reach at most 500cd/m¬≤. Please!!!\\n\\nFrom the DisplayMate review:\\nFor most image content the Galaxy Note8 provides over 490 cd/m2, comparable or higher than most LCD displays in this size class. The measured Brightness on the Home screen is even higher at over 540 nits (note, the home screen has a lower APL and therefore requires less white output).\\n\\nMeasured Average Brightness at 50% Average Picture Level: 525 cd/m¬≤\\nMeasured Full Brightness 100% Full Screen White: 423cd/m¬≤\\n\\nDon't read the press - go read the DisplayMate review yourself and then quote them correctly.

Our country is a wonderful place, built on dreams, freedom and diversity. There are also many grave injustices in our past. Today we have a country where people can work together even if they don't look like each other. But we also live in a country where people have been being murdered by police because of the way they look. If someone wants to stand during the national anthem to appreciate the beautiful positive strengths of our nation, that is very respectable and in line with tradition. If someone wants to break tradition and kneel during the national anthem to be mindful of the real injustices of the past and present, that is also respectable. One of the greatest parts of our nation is that we are free to act however we feel, as long as we are not harming others. Now our president is telling us who to vote for and how to act. That is not American. And it is scary because a lot of people are listening to him. We need to be free to vote how we choose without a president holding rallies for candidates. We need to be free to salute our greatness, or kneel to show mindfulness of our weaknesses. Freedom is what we salute. Tradition is a valid part of society, but no one should ever be told by a president that they must follow tradition or be fired from their career. Hank, I understand that there are other things to talk about. I understand that you don't want to become part of an echo chamber. But you are a thoughtful and articulate American citizen and many people respect your voice. The world and the nation are facing some serious problems right now that could become more serious if we do not talk about them like civil respectful adults.

What is your risk vs potential gain? Compare the interest on your mortgage and average gains in the stock market (but past performance is not an indicator of future performance). Think about the chances of you meeting Harvey or Irma. \\nThings to consider when paying off the student loan\\n-there is probably going to be a time limit when the interest rate on the student loan is lower. If there is, take advantage of that and take that into an account into your calculation\\nThings to consider when buying a car\\n-I had money to buy the whole thing but I heard from places that financing it builds your credit up. I am not sure if that is true or not but I just went with it. Always do more research and think about how much of that extra credit rating will save you money on future mortgage rates\\nAs for the cryptocurrencies:\\n-any form of currency trading is as good as a gamble, and cryptocurrencies are currencies. Gold is technically not a currency nowadays, but many still treat it like as it is. Gold price is probably overvalued right now as well. If you research on how much of gold is actually used for real world value such as electronics and jewelries, it's really a tiny, tiny portion of the gold demand. That is not what is causing gold to rise in price. It's other people who treat gold as currency or a storage of value and want a stockpile of them in case the world goes into a global apocalypse or world war, so that they can chop that gold into pieces to trade food, instead of bottle caps.",0,0

uwukx6DGmW8,"Okay, I hate to be that guy, but I need to make a few points before people start hopping on the  financial diet bandwagon:\\nFirst, when letting someone give you financial advice, ALWAYS question their credentials. Are these women CPAs, CFAs, or FCs? What qualifies them to give advice (even if it's free)?\\nSecond, I resent the implication that financial professionals are snake oil salesmen. Qualified financial professionals are heavily regulated. When you walk into a bank and ask for someone who can advise you about your finances, they have a legal, fiduciary responsibility to give you the best advice to reach your goals.\\n Which brings me to my third and final point: Investment banks like fidelity aren't the only game in town. When considering your options about investments, you don't HAVE to go straight to the major investment banks. You can always walk into the local branch of your bank and ask if there is someone you can talk to about investments. If your bank has branches in more than one state, they more than likely have a financial consultant on staff you can set up an appointment with.",0,0

uwukx6DGmW8,"Time is running out..... Jesus Christ will return soon for His bride (church) 1 Thess. 4:13-18 (by catching up in the clouds). WAKE UP & accept forgiveness of your sins through Jesus' agonizing death on the cross. He paid the price of our sins freely out of His deep LOVE for us. Man has turned from our Lord God in blatant disobedience calling evil good and good evil & we are under His judgment. He is a loving Father, but also a righteous Judge. REPENT before it's too late. You do not want to be left behind. Cry out to Jesus today & ask Him to be Lord over your life then turn from sin. If left behind you can still accept Jesus as your Savior, but you'll endure the wrath of God & Satan during the Great Tribulation which will be unfathomable. Be also forewarned to NOT take the mark of the beast (perhaps the RFID chip or bar code in righthand or forehead required to buy or sell), for those who do cannot be saved. The Lord God gave us free will so the choice is ours, but let those who have ears hear. May the Lord establish His Word Reference: (John 5:24-30;  Eph. 2:1-10,I Thes.4:9-5:11, Zech. 2:8-9, Rev.3:22, Rev. 7:9-17)  I recommend YouTube channel & website informedchristians for info on Biblical signs of Jesus' return, Christian living,  etc.",0,0

uwukx6DGmW8,"Regarding stopping eating fast food, I found meal planning and, adding more power to that, slow-cooking to be the best for me to tackle that problem. If you've meal-planned, you already have a plan for dinner and the ingredients at home and it's on your calendar so all the decision making is done and you know you can do it. To further that with the slow-cooker, if you started that meal in the morning, it's already done or mostly done and you aren't going to stop and grab fast food as you have to get home and check on your cooker/meal, or add the last ingredient that only cooks for 30 min (like egg noodles for chicken noodle soup). It won't matter how tired you are as there's little or no prep left and it beats sitting in line at the drivethru. Seriously, thinking about a roast in my cooker with the potatoes drenched in the drippings underneath is so much more tempting than a fast food burger when I'm hungry. \\nI find when I employ these tactics, I save hundreds of dollars a month on food (there are 5 people in my household) and tend to have my clothes fit better.\\nI think this can easily go hand in hand with Chelsea's idea of bulk cooking on a weekend for lunches or dinners throughout the week. A big slow cooker meal on Wed gives you leftovers for Thurs and Fri that you can look forward to and a nice meal mid-week to break up any monotony.",0,0

uwukx6DGmW8,"I'd have to disagree with the advice that was given to not pay off one's credit card in full if it would deplete all of one's cash reserves. It seems plain old silly to carry a balance on a card costing 12-20% interest annually, while simultaneously holding cash in a bank account yielding <1% annually. This is especially the case given that credit cards allow you to redraw upon the credit. \\n\\nIf you have a credit card balance, IMO, it's better to just pay off as much of it as possible (probably only to the point of not risking overdraft charges on other accounts), and if it's necessary to redraw on that same card, do so if necessary. \\n\\nBy keeping a cash reserve and a credit card balance, you're taking a guaranteed loss rather than risking a smaller loss.

uwukx6DGmW8,"So the thing about credit card debt and a cash emergency fund is that a) credit card debt can balloon VERY QUICKLY and  b) you can probably pay for most emergencies with a credit card (or maybe a cash advance).  So it doesn't make sense to hang onto cash just in case when your credit card debt is subject to huge interest rates.  Better to pay off the card as much as you can--if there's an emergency, you can put money back on, but if there's not, you'll end up a lot closer to being out of debt.  Then once you're out of debt, save up your emergency fund so you don't have to go back into debt.",0,1

To me the emphasis on reading as a gateway to learning, means that those kids (and adults) who can't read for valid reasons are not going to be getting the education they need or the sensitive and compassionate help they require. We should be aiming for education for all, regardless of ability and inclusive of those with disabilities.",0,0

Samsung proves including all of these is possible, there should be *NO* excuses!\\n\\nAbsolutely beautiful device! It's unique and inspired, yet efficient. Gorgeous display! And I've always liked the S Pen. This is the most complete Samsung ever. It's truly awesome! I'm happy they finally implemented a dual camera, I'm a huge fan of the telephoto lens and it's advantages.\\n\\nNow believe it or not the Galaxy Note series is a bit of a touchy subject. In terms of features, the Notes have the most. And with the inclusion of the S Pen it's hard to find a phone worthy of even being compared to it. The Galaxy Note is kinda in it's own special category; it's a phone for people who *need to get stuff done* . For people who don't want a Microsoft Surface Pro, people who want everything they need in their smartphone. So when considering the Note 8 or comparing it to others...it all comes down to *personal NEED* .\\n\\nDo bigger things indeed.

wQD1JvJZXdI,"Reviewers have to stop quoting the 1200cd/m¬≤ brightness, which is for 1% Average Picture Level and has no impact on real life brightness which is between 50% and 100% APL. At those APL's the Note 8 is just like any other phone and very similar to the LG V30. There is no scenario of phone usage that will ever display 1200cd/m¬≤, this is a theoretical value for a picture with 1% white and 99% black - ALL OLED displays can reach super bright whites in that scenario - only DIsplayMate make such useless measurements. Just quote the 100% APL brightness or 50% like most reviewers do. Please.\\n\\nI am getting fed up of the press relaying nonsense brightness figures without understanding them! If you use your web browser in the sun, the white on a Youtube page would reach at most 500cd/m¬≤. Please!!!\\n\\nFrom the DisplayMate review:\\nFor most image content the Galaxy Note8 provides over 490 cd/m2, comparable or higher than most LCD displays in this size class. The measured Brightness on the Home screen is even higher at over 540 nits (note, the home screen has a lower APL and therefore requires less white output).\\n\\nMeasured Average Brightness at 50% Average Picture Level: 525 cd/m¬≤\\nMeasured Full Brightness 100% Full Screen White: 423cd/m¬≤\\n\\nDon't read the press - go read the DisplayMate review yourself and then quote them correctly.

Chemistry. Players who are focused on being their best, within their roles, for the collective strength of the team; to win a championship. That's how it's supposed to be. Brothers in arms.

Yes reading is super important but by focusing on that we actually do a great disservice to students who struggle to read or who have visual impairment. Additionally there are those who can read fine but who learn best through other methods. To me the emphasis on reading as a gateway to learning, means that those kids (and adults) who can't read for valid reasons are not going to be getting the education they need or the sensitive and compassionate help they require. We should be aiming for education for all, regardless of ability and inclusive of those with disabilities.",0,0

5e0LMJRJFaY,"From my boyfriend: microwaves work by essentially vibrating magnets really quickly. This means that only molecules with polorization are affected, but any that are polarized will vibrate, creating heat from friction. Water obviously is a polarized molicule.

5e0LMJRJFaY,"Bunny I love the pilot frixion pens and markers, they are so stinking cool. Like the other posts have stated, friction causes heat, which ‚Äúerases‚Äù the ink using heat from rubbing. Which explains the microwave use, it would do the same I imagine if you left it in a hot vehicle. So then to have your writing reappear, if say  one day you did forget it in your car, (on a hot day) then place in the freezer, voil√†! Also I bet if you erased a mistake, and had rewritten your work, that on a freezing cold day the opposite effect would occur, if left in vehicle, or placed in the freezer. So basically they are great when used in moderate temperatures. And I was wondering about the rocket wave notebook, and if it was worth the price, so thank you so much for this review.

If you leave a notebook with that pen in a hot car, you could likely kiss your notes goodbye.\\nAlso, the pen will stop working way before it runs out of ink.

G_wmoWfZQAM,"So the first thing i do for my natural makeup or should i say every day is dab a few spots of Supreme peeling gel on my face. (You only use it once a week because your skin fun fact only has five layers ) rrub around to get all the dead skin off. Rinse, then following with  Supreme perfecting moisture cream apply that all over my face ( my only expensive products cause a sales lady flirted with my dad. And he was put on the spot and could not say no. Also Supreme is from Izeriel ) then for the base I use  Merle Norman Alabaster beige using the sponge it came with (i wet the sponge. Fun fact i heard was the sponge being damp helps set. Idk if its true ) then i use my Loreal  nouveau true match warm concealer highlighting my T, unxer my eyes and on my eye lid, Cheek bone, lip, chin and nose then blend it with a beauty blender (damp) Then i use the Elf eyeshadow brush and use Illuminate By Ashley Tisdale beach goddess palette. I use the Maui color as my base. Its like a soft beach sand color. Golden/ peach to me. Then i go for St. Barts as my outer corner to smoke the eye, and i go in the crease. Then i use the Fiji color to blend the edges to my base. Then Tahti to highlight under my eyebrows. I go back to Maui and and do my inner bottom eye. Then to ST. Barts to highlight my outer corner bottom of my eye. Then i use the Seychelles contour and outline my cheek bones and forehead. Blend that in. Go in with the blush from the pallete and dab that on. Im just like you, not a big fan on blush. Then to finish off with this pallete i use the highlight St. Lucia and highlight the cheekbones, nose, chin, lip and outer face. Mascara i use is Loreal Voluminous hydrofuge black M900 and for some reason last i do my eyebrows lol.  I use Covergirl brow and eye makers midnight brown pencil to shape my eyebrows i spray hairspray on my eyebrow brush and shape them. And they stay in place the rest of the day. And thats my look for the day!! Like i said i dont have a lot of money and dont ask for much so i use what i can get. But it still makes me look absolutely beautiful. It does what i need it to do and thats all i can ask for. Thank yoy for sharing your video and i would love to do a video for you as well so you can see. But thats impossible for yoy to notice lol. I watch you sc everyday and i love itt!! Maybe my dreams in acting will come true and i will finally meet you. I can not wait to see more videos.

5e0LMJRJFaY,The steam from the water makes it so you can't burn the note book this is because steam helps retract the heat like how water stops fire and heat helps remove ink and mkes it pop out until its gone BTW I'm 11 years old sorry for how long this was I'm a science geek but have a wonderful day.,0,0
5e0LMJRJFaY,I think that the pens erase with heat. My science teacher told me that and that's why you can't use them on checks because checks use heat to scan and see if they're real and it will erase the ink from piolet frixions,0,0

I don‚Äôt know how much did you pay for this, but maybe you should try just the pens on any notebook and if you want to erase just leave them out in the sunshine. :)",0,0

5e0LMJRJFaY,"I really want this! As someone who jots stuff down, makes lists and has a habit of taking up room scribbling, this would be soooo useful. It would probably put a dent in my paper usage. As for still being able to see the writing after microwaving it, I don't think it would bother me much. I press down hard when I write so more often than not, I tend to see the words on the next page anyway from the pressure imprint or from pen ink bleeding through. So not much of a con for me. Already use to it. The only thing I can think of that would make it better is if you were able to use more than just those specific pens on it. I use highlighters with note taking to help break up the text to make it easier to read through. I guess it's good the pens come in multiple colors. I'm wondering what would happen if you also used a regular pencil since it's also erasable. Maybe it mentions something in the instructions? All in all I would totally get this.",0,0

This means that only molecules with polorization are affected, but any that are polarized will vibrate, creating heat from friction. Water obviously is a polarized molicule.

439iY0844xI,"I'm pretty sure Aladdin remained a Prince up until Jafar zapped him, literally undoing his previous wish. I believe it was even confirmed by a writer or something at some point. They also confirmed that Jafar was indeed most dangerous as a Sorcerer Supreme (his second wish) than he was as a genie (Sorcerer Supreme aren't bound to anyone or anything, after all). \\n\\nAs for why he just doesn't use his hypnotic staff to become sultan, I'm pretty sure there's literally a scene in the movie where the Sultan pretty much throws off it's effects, suggesting that it's a weak hypnotism at best, and not entirely reliable. Plus, it's kinda conspicuous, given that Aladdin noticed pretty much immediately and just broke the staff easily. True power, the kind you get from being born into a position of power like the Sultan, isn't something that can be so easily broken like a staff.\\n\\nWhich sort of makes me realize that Jafar basically parallels Aladdin in a way. Both are entrenched within an established caste within society, both are unsatisfied with their lives and aim for the throne, both wish to utilize the genie in order to obtain their goals. But that brings us to the idea that Aladdin could just, up and get a job. Like, wut? \\n\\nThe other street vendors aren't hiring, since it'll mean that they'll have to part with their own limited wealth, and seemingly have no real need for a helper (especially when you can just raise your children to help you, as is common in the lower rungs of society, and far more common before child labor laws become a thing). Plus, becoming a vendor or a vendor's aid would require that Aladdin ignores the plight of starving children like him, since it's doubtful that he'll be able to retain his job if he's slipping food to poor people on the sly. \\n\\nSo tell me, what exactly are his options? He can't sell food or other materials, since he lacks the initial capital to have things to be sold. He can't just go into business, because he doesn't have any marketable skills with which he can sell himself. It's a shitty situation to be in, and it's a situation a lot of people find themselves in, even here and now in America. So try to be a bit more sensitive, ey? If you think it's oh so easy to escape poverty, by all means, speak up and let people know. But don't just sit there and criticize the poor without really thinking through their situation.",0,0

It is possible becouse he was speaking to good and he was to smart. If not,  sending him would be stupid.  Who knows,  maybe he would take lamp for himself (becouse he could know what it is).So finding somebody who can do that for Jafar was only option.  What about one person? First,  Abu is just monkey.  Second,  about the cave we know only this what Jafar said and it could be a lie.   It was better for him to send there just one person. More people, more possible that someone can take a lamp for himself and it is easier, when you know who have the thing that you need and hunt for just one thief. I just don't understand why lamp was so important for him if he just want to be new sultan. He controled sultan so he could give him an  order to just give Jafar his title or force Jasmine for wedding. And if sultan was under his spell,  why he didn't do this same with Jasmine?  In the end, why he just didn't kill them.  He was the most important, reach and powerful man in Agrabah, so probably he would be next sultan if previous dynasty was destroyed.",0,0

439iY0844xI,I'm going to clear some things up for you guys.\n- Aladdin suffers from a fairly common condition called imposter syndrome.\n- The genie actually does make him a prince but because of Aladdin's condition he doesn't internalize it and therefore feels guilty about everything. So when genie tells Aladdin to tell Jasmin the truth he actually wants him to tell her that he didn't used to be a prince but he is one now.\n- Jafar needs the lamp to be legitimately named Sultan which is why he pursues it. When he is made Sultan he legitimately can banish Aladdin and take away his status as a royal and does so.\n- When Jafar is banished Aladdin doesn't receive his title back automatically. It's likely he needs to either get it back from the restored Sultan (awkward) or the genie (going back on a promise).,1,0

All the events for the rest of the film constitute the genie's convoluted plan to fulfill that wish. Aladdin was not a prince until he married Jasmine, because he never asked to be a prince, he asked to be made into one.\\n\\nThe cave scene is most likely an homage to the original tale from 1001 Arabian Nights, which is why it doesn't make a lot of sense nor have consistent rules. If you've ever read the book, you'll recognize the feel of it. Magic being fickle, dangerous, full of lies and half-truths is a very central theme to the Arabian Nights stories - genies are not supposed to be good guys. From my memory of the original stories, I might even say it's more likely that the genie engineered the entire cave debacle specifically to lure in the type of person he knew would eventually free him. He claims to be imprisoned in the lamp, but genies are deceptive. Does he ever say he can't use magic while in there? If no, then he made the cave. The whole movie is him trying to get Aladdin on his side so he'll be freed. And if this were anything like the original stories, Aladdin would be brutally murdered the second he freed the genie.",0,0

Assuming that they got back on the same night it makes me wonder how fast the carpet was going, clearly not the same speed throughout the trip because of the slow river ride.  Going to all these places: the desert where the horse are running, Egypt where the Spinx was being build, Greece where the statues are which look like the ones in Hercules, and China where the fireworks are going off with a dragon before returning to the palace.  I get that most of the places I listed they did not actually stop and check it out but it's the great distance along with the very short time frame that is tripping me up.  Did they leave the palace when it was late at night because all of these other places are experiencing nighttime and when they got back it is still nighttime at the palace because Agrabah would be experiencing daylight when they got back from China or did they just skip a day and came back the next night if this is the case then how is it that no one notice them gone for so long especially Jasmine's father who is pressuring Jasmine to marry a prince before her birthday which is less than three days away because it is the law.

I mean, he can hypnotize other people AND he got the sultans guard on his side. Simple as that: Get a thief to steal the lamp. Poissibility number 1: thief fulfills the deal and gives djafar the lamp. Number 2: thief doesn't hand over lamp so he has to hypnotize him. If this doesn't work - send the guards. Finally - IF all of these possibilities doesn't work for djafar he can still kill the thief - who would miss him anyway? Sounds logical to me ;)\\n\\nOh and Aladin keeps his purity of character because he steals because he has to - not because he wants to. He's not a rotten character, he just had very bad luck (remember? Dead mom, bad father who left for adventure and hab the time of his life - midlife crisis?)\\n\\nThe part about Aladin being a prince is also very simple.

Princes are humans just like alladin or jafar, so a prince's clothes are really what make him a prince. That doesn't really matter though because alladin turns out to be somewhat more than a prince by deciding he doesn't want to be one again.",0,0

I wouldn‚Äôt have to serve any kind of master, nor would I have to stay for all eternity in a lamp waiting for someone to release me.

439iY0844xI,"When it comes to the cave, I think part of it has to do with intention. Like, the guy who had to slit the throats to get the scarabs obviously would have tried to steal something for his own evil purposes. Aladin and Abu were not. When Aladin was touching the carpet, he wasn't trying to steal it, he just stepped on it. But then when Abu tried to steal the gem, that's when the lava defense system was activated. \\n\\nAlso, I watched a video explaining how when Jafar started making it wishes, it some how undid Aladin being a prince and that when Genie was going on about 'tell her the truth' it wasn't that he should tell her that he wasn't a prince but that he was indeed poor 'street rat' when they first met ( because even after Jazmine finds out who he was, he still pretends that he was always rich ). I don't remember exactly what was said, but I swear it made sense.\\n\\nAnd if would be really mean if Jazmine took the lamp to start making wishes. That would really be taking advantage of the genie. Even if she was wishing things like make sure Jafar never comes back, it would still be kind of selfish and takinng advantage of genie's sacrifice. What I never understood is why couldn't genie make aldin a prince AFTER he was set free? Like, he still has genie powers, so why can't he, out of his own free will, make Aladin a prince again?\\n\\nI realize there are still some plot holes, but I feel this fills in a few of them.",0,0

439iY0844xI,"When it comes to the cave, I think part of it has to do with intention. Like, the guy who had to slit the throats to get the scarabs obviously would have tried to steal something for his own evil purposes. Aladin and Abu were not. When Aladin was touching the carpet, he wasn't trying to steal it, he just stepped on it. But then when Abu tried to steal the gem, that's when the lava defense system was activated. \\n\\nAlso, I watched a video explaining how when Jafar started making it wishes, it some how undid Aladin being a prince and that when Genie was going on about 'tell her the truth' it wasn't that he should tell her that he wasn't a prince but that he was indeed poor 'street rat' when they first met ( because even after Jazmine finds out who he was, he still pretends that he was always rich ). I don't remember exactly what was said, but I swear it made sense.\\n\\nAnd if would be really mean if Jazmine took the lamp to start making wishes. That would really be taking advantage of the genie. Even if she was wishing things like make sure Jafar never comes back, it would still be kind of selfish and takinng advantage of genie's sacrifice. What I never understood is why couldn't genie make aldin a prince AFTER he was set free? Like, he still has genie powers, so why can't he, out of his own free will, make Aladin a prince again?\\n\\nI realize there are still some plot holes, but I feel this fills in a few of them.",0,0

Take all the life saving magical medicine for their own kid. They don't even think about maybe using that all-curing plant to grow more of them. To give some to the common folk. Nope! They are just peasents!\\n-  It was way to easy for that old women to get into the palace. \\n- They never found that girl for 18 years, yet she was in a tower just two days away. ...Seriously?\\n- Highest ranking military official: A horse! \\n- And also... where the heck did she get that chameleon from?

439iY0844xI,"Dude, you miss the entire point of a diamond in the rough. A diamond in the rough is not supposed to be a hero. They're not supposed to be outwardly good. They're supposed to be flawed, to be the outlaw, the seemingly bad person on the outside who has a good interior. They are outwardly flawed, but with the proper polishing are capable of true greatness. That is what it means to be a diamond in the rough.\\n\\nThe cave is not looking for a hero. It is not looking for a perfect man. It is looking for a man who is good at heart but does bad things, a man it can help to raise up to their true potential. It is looking for someone with a good nature who, due to circumstance is pushed towards evil. Going through the cave is a test, a test to see if the person is worthy of paradise and of the power the lamp possesses. An evil person who attains that lamp, who sets foot into heaven, will corrupt it and destroy it for everyone else (that's exactly what happens when Jafar gains the power of the lamp). But a good man, even if he is beset with flaws and has many sins to his name, can be improved, can be made as good as any king, because he is, at his heart, a diamond, if a bit rough on the outside. On the other hand, an evil man, even if he is in the highest of places, is still an evil man and will eventually be destroyed by his own evil.\\n\\nThat is why the cave puts in place its rules. No truly evil man can enter the cave, or their own evil will consume them as soon as they set foot inside. But a good man, even if a flawed thief, who sets foot inside may not necessarily be consumed, not unless they give in to their temptation to do evil. They are warned not to touch the forbidden treasure. But touching in this context doesn't mean just rubbing up against it by accident. The cave clearly knows the heart of those who enter it. If you pick up a piece of gold, but you aren't intending to take it, nothing bad would happen to you. But if you were to do as Abu did and grab a gem with the intent of stealing it, the cave would read that intention and damn you to Hell (the lava).\\n\\nThe cave is a test. It is a lot like Purgatory. The evil, the truly wicked and wretched, they always go to Hell. They can't ever set foot in purgatory or paradise. But a good man who is flawed may pass through purgatory, being tempted on the way and suffering, but if they resist that temptation, if they do what is right, they will eventually reach paradise. For Aladin, Paradise is being in that palace, escaping the street life he suffered under as a child, being rich, and having the love of a beautiful woman. \\n\\nThe reason the cave goes nuts when Abu steals the ruby is because, although he is an animal, he is like Aladin's second half. He represents a part of Aladin, the trickster and thief. He is Aladin at his darkest. Aladin himself may steal, but he is good at heart. Notice that he doesn't ever steal to make money, but rather just to live. If you were starving, no job, no prospects, shunned by all of society, and all you had was your pet monkey, would you not steal the occasional scrap of food to get by? You're deluding yourself if you think you wouldn't. Aladin KNOWS what he's doing is wrong, but he also has no other choice. A part of him enjoys stealing, a part of him would like to steal his way into wealth, but the good side of him says not to. Abu is different. If not for Abu being regulated by Aladin, that little monkey would steal everything and would be the most selfish little creature you can imagine (he refused to feed those kids and mistreated Jasmine)\\n\\nSomething similar is reflected in Jafar, actually. Jafar himself is quite evil. Iago, not so much. Iago certainly pretends to be evil, but I think he is pulled that direction by Jafar. Iago is Jafar's light side, and Abu is Aladin's dark side. So when Abu took that Gem, to the cave that was the same as Aladin himself taking it, because in the cave's mind, Abu and Aladin are just two parts of the same being.",0,0

2iObySa91b0,You are completely out of touch with real consumers. A bezel is necessary for your phone cover to rest without covering the screen and affecting usage. This is the limit in bezel thinness IMO. On bigger phones a thin top or lower bezel makes it more difficult to handle.,0,0

2iObySa91b0,"Pixel 2 XL nails all the fundamental aspects of a great smartphone brilliantly except design. While the design is certainly good, it doesn't seem very refined and some elements of it are quite bothersome. I wasn't asking for a beautiful design but at least it should be polished to look premium, something which I can't say about the thick and unsightly top bezel that causes asymmetry and the noticeable side bezels. I'm hoping it's something that'll grow on me by time. But aside from that, it's still the best overall smartphone right now IMO. But why can't it or any other phone be just flawless (by realistic standards)? Why does some annoyance always have to exist on every phone? Waiting for 2018.",0,0

PNPMEQm_vAI,"The video was still amazing despite the eight-sided pencil. In fact, I thought it was a display of greater skill to make a cake with eight sides. Also, don't worry. I was once asked to make a cake for a ground braking event for a church in my area. I had decided to create a cake that was in the shape of the new building they were putting up and even had a detailed sketch that described how to make it. This was a year or two ago, before I discovered your wonderful tutorials, and I wasn't very skilled at creating cakes. I had bought about 10 boxes of cake mix that I baked, cooled, and started to stack with store bought icing. It was a disaster! The morning of, I was still making this cake. The different colors of cake mixes were all in a jumbled mess. Hardly even stacked. I decided I would take it anyway for I had agreed to make it and couldn't back out now. The cake, in its 3ft by 4ft messy glory, and I arrived. I really couldn't bare to look at it so I just sat it down in the dessert section and left it. While trying to be anywhere but where my cake was, I wondered over to the other side of the dessert section and low and behold, there was the exact cake I had wished to create for the event only smaller and made by some other lady. It was perfect. Straight sides, nice frosting, and a beautiful little roof to match. I did find out later that the lady had used rice crispy, but that is beside the point. She had made this wonderful cake and I had made a large mound of cake and frosting. I went back to my seat and tried to forget about it. Later on, I came back to my cake to see if it had sparked any interest. Turns out that people took the term ground breaking literally and thought of my cake as the actual ground breaking part. You know, the actual digging of shovels into dirt and pulling up soil. Despite this, they thought it was reallly good and were eating a good deal of it. This was not really what I was really going for but it worked. This all goes to show that we all make mistakes and that in the end they can still be great. Making a pencil cake with eight sides instead of six is nothing compared to serving a mound of cake for a public event so don't beat yourself up about it. Your cake was amazing regardless of the sides and I'd pay for a slice. Thank you for all your awesome videos, they truly make me laugh. \\nP.S.-Maybe in the future you could make a giant pumpkin cake filled with delicious pumpkin and other fall flavors! You're the best, thank ya for your amazing cake tutorial!üòÑ",0,0

odhMmAPDc54,"(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\\n\\nJesus said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\\n\\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\\nbut Jesus hid himself, \\nand went out of the temple,\\n\\ngoing through the midst of them, \\nand so passed by.\\n\\n(John 8:58-59).\\n\\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\\n\\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\\n\\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(I AM):\\n\\n(Gk. ego emimi);\\n\\n*(John 6:35)<---And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst).\\n*(John 10:7)<---Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep).\\n*(John 10:14)<---I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine).\\n*(John 15:1)<---I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman).\\n*(John 18:5)<---They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\\n\\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\\n\\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\\n\\nThen answered Jesus \\nand said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \\n\\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\\nfor what things soever he doeth, \\n\\nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\\n\\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\\n\\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \\nand sheweth him all things \\nthat himself doeth:\\n\\nand he will shew him \\ngreater works than these, \\nthat ye may marvel.\\n\\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\\n\\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \\nand quickeneth them; \\neven so the Son quickeneth \\nwhom he will.\\n\\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\\n(John 5:19-21).",0,0

aircAruvnKk,"after watching this video it reminded me of a thing i watched before by sethbling. he coded a neural network that learned to play mario, called marI/O. so i watched that video again and that program didnt use preset hidden layers i thought it was more fascinating after watching your video.",0,0

aircAruvnKk,"Plan to patreon.\\nNot aware of any other lecturer who's able to clearly illuminate the conceptual aspects of topics underpinning the subjects you cover in such a clear graphical way, all the while using a flowing narrative which then links the parts into a cohesive whole. (Btw why don't more lecturers do this, isn't linking the pieces to see where else one can go the 'point' after all ?) \\nNot taking these uploads for granted either: I recall that the former host of the series Space Time left to do other things just as he was reaching his stride in the brilliant exposition of commonly misunderstood topics usually only treated with an inadequate or even an inaccurate pop-science synopsis, else left to laborious extrapolation from obtuse course texts. (The new Space Time host is a very good communicator, it's just that sometimes after only a single episode presentation of path integral QM for example, I'm then left wanting a complete in-depth series of stepped presentations for that topic.) For me your presentations seem to be in a 'goldilocks' zone of sorts: having just the right amount of stepped quantitative building blocks analysis to fully appreciate the 'why' as the path taken to the conceptual insight payoff. \\nHopefully philanthropic organizations that support science education will make sufficient donations such that you'll always have the resources and incentives to continue making these in the way you make them.",2,0

odhMmAPDc54,"(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\\n\\nJesus said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\\n\\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\\nbut Jesus hid himself, \\nand went out of the temple,\\n\\ngoing through the midst of them, \\nand so passed by.\\n\\n(John 8:58-59).\\n\\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\\n\\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\\n\\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(I AM):\\n\\n(Gk. ego emimi);\\n\\n*(John 6:35)<---And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst).\\n*(John 10:7)<---Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep).\\n*(John 10:14)<---I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine).\\n*(John 15:1)<---I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman).\\n*(John 18:5)<---They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\\n\\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\\n\\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\\n\\nThen answered Jesus \\nand said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \\n\\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\\nfor what things soever he doeth, \\n\\nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\\n\\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\\n\\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \\nand sheweth him all things \\nthat himself doeth:\\n\\nand he will shew him \\ngreater works than these, \\nthat ye may marvel.\\n\\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\\n\\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \\nand quickeneth them; \\neven so the Son quickeneth \\nwhom he will.\\n\\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\\n(John 5:19-21).",0,0

It's only been in the last ten or so that decent explanations and practical examples have surfaced for those of us that don't have advanced understanding of mathematics. I like your take on the idea of a bunch of 'knobs' - and here's why. \\n\\nKnobs are an analog in more than one way here. But mostly because it temporarily removes the 'strictness' of the digital paradigm and gives the sensation of something that is smoothly adjusted, as if bringing into focus as best as possible the image that is being evaluated into an eventual deterministic result. So thanks for that thought process.\\n\\nIt made me think of beams of light emanating from each of the input layer neurons, and then aimed as if a laser to the receiving second layer - through a mesh that effected the frequency (weight) of the light beam - where the second layer was like an array of prisms that could be turned.\\n\\nI look forward to part II and hope that you will get into backward propagation.",0,0

And Machine Learning itself is split into many sub-domains, primarily based on the presence or absence of tagged data to use for learning, but also on the need for time-domain processing (versus single-event processing).\\n\\nIn between fall low training techniques, such as Gradient Boosting, and perhaps some Bayesian techniques.",0,0

aircAruvnKk,"Thanks for the video! It was truly well done!\\n\\nJust a point of clarification: shouldn't the column vector containing the biases at 14:40 be indexed from 0 to k (rather than 0 to n), since you're supposing there are (k+1) neurons in the first hidden layer after the input layer, and hence (k+1) biases? You need the same dimensionality to sum the matrix product and the *b* vector anyhow. And at 16:00 it seems the *a^(0)* matrix changed from its correct form at 14:40. It should have dimension (k+1)x(n) as it did at 14:40, but the k and n indices have been interchanged. Thanks again and I'm looking forward to the next video!",1,0

Thumbs up.\\n\\nI understand the motivation for using neurons and neural networks but those terms lead people to think computer neural networks are like brains and they are not.  All analogies break down eventually, the computer neural network and the biological neural networks breaks down right away.  For example, brain neurons either fire (depolarize) or they don't where the computer neurons can hold a continuous range of values (despite the sigma function).   I think the computer networks should be described as having nodes (input nodes, hidden nodes and output nodes) to avoid thinking computers will have feelings anytime soon.",1,0

hRRnKJwbrcw,"Yuck....\\n\\n\\nAs a total girl power Spice Girl of the 90s myself, I do not believe that every woman has dealt with harassment. Never heard of anyone dealing with this sort of thing outside these news reports. I also wouldn't consider a passing inappropriate comment (which nearly everybody makes from time to time) to be harassment. I don't separate men from women, really; disrespectful and inappropriate behavior is wrong regardless of who is committing it against whom. Everything can and does go both ways.

You want equality but then we patronize to women like they are different, that's sexism, im not even gonna listen to what these dumb cunts have to say, they probably bullied their way to say something based only on their gender, well i'm not gonna listen , and i dont care if progressive people call me a sexist",0,0

hRRnKJwbrcw,"Judgement is coming to America, God is not pleased! America, a so called Christian Nation teaches their children they can choose their gender, that we came from monkeys, that elements and space dust formed them. They take the very knowledge of the Bible and turn it upside down! They sanction the sin of Sodom as good and right, parading it down our streets for the children to see. We let our government and media harbor and cultivate a cesspool of sin from the tv programs, music, entertainment, fashion, sexual perversion, intellectual manipulation, a greedy people. While the truth in the Bible remains to be seen and while we murder God's children in the womb, we starve them of the truth in school and direct their minds and eyes to the sins of the world. We see evil for good and good for evil. Great sorrow and judgement will come upon all sinners not saved by Christ. Do not get the biblical (Book of Revelations) mark of the beast RFID chip in your hand or forehead, nor worship the false Savior (Man of Sin) who is probably Obama, and the False Prophet is probably Pope Frances.\\n\\nI am writing this to bring light to the truth about Jesus Christ (Yahshua haMashiach) and God the Heavenly Father (YHWH), who is Holy and perfect. Christ and the Father are one, Christ is God embodied. It is by the grace of God that I am saved through faith and obedience unto Christ Jesus, the Word of God made flesh, the Living Lord of Lords, appointed to rule over all that is in Heaven and earth by the authority of Yahuah (YHWH). \\n\\nI have been born again by seeing that my ways were wicked, that my sin is an act of rebellion and is a stain upon the goodness of God and His glory. For without Christ, we are but vain men living according to the flesh and desires of this world, in ignorance to the ways of God.\\n\\nWithout the grace of God, Jesus Christ would never have come to set us free, His love for us was so great that He sent his ONLY begotten son (fully man, fully God) to atone for all the sins of the world through a pure and Holy life, and bore the burden on the cross of cavalry for us as an innocent and blameless image of God.\\n\\nIt is by accepting God's grace through trusting and obeying the gospel and declaring with your lips and believing in your heart that Jesus is the Lord whom God has raised up from the dead on the third day, that we may be saved. \\n\\nRepent!\\nhttp://youtu.be/JRXyVbCVj-c\\n\\nJesus is Lord and Savior\\nhttps://youtu.be/2mgUPt2KI08\\n\\nAtheist Delusion \\nhttps://youtu.be/ChWiZ3iXWwM\\n\\nBeware \\nhttps://youtu.be/Gba8BtJAOqg\\n\\nRFID Chips - Say No\\nhttps://youtu.be/8jAPFZSU0vo\\n\\nIdols before God?\\nhttps://youtu.be/QO44xspRoww\\n\\nEnd-Times Scripture\\nhttps://youtu.be/mV2eq-KRC3U\\n\\nEnt-Time Disaster Signs\\nhttps://youtu.be/K4SI38ji2rI\\n\\nMainstream Indoctrination\\nhttps://youtu.be/Pe1QAY3C7n8\\n\\nSatan is god of the media\\nhttps://youtu.be/MHOZP0PPUXg\\n\\nComing Soon!\\nhttp://youtu.be/wvltsVh7rPs \\n\\nRapture Sign\\nhttps://youtu.be/Ivx4M0FB2S4 \\n\\nCome to Christ\\nhttps://youtu.be/a3VpPvp3QK4\\n\\nMan of Sin\\nhttps://youtu.be/bgu2bDOfNw8\\n\\nEnd of Grace - 120 Jubilees\\nhttp://youtu.be/vu6Q9ow9fHs \\n\\nRFID Zombies \\nhttp://youtu.be/-x7BS5G6oUgk\\n\\nWalmart - FEMA Camp\\nhttp://youtu.be/XsPl0C-pgwI\\n\\n40 Days\\nhttp://youtu.be/Bf3JqruftUg",0,0

y_nuMEtwUW4,64 teams in the playoff!?  He can't be serious?  He's suggesting that teams make their schedule within that year when they know they won't make the playoff (@6:10).  This seems like a ridiculously difficult setup he's trying to explain.  The only reason he wants a larger playoff is because his team isn't good enough to compete with the top four.  So he argues for a bigger playoff.  He should worry about winning out the season then worry about whether or not the playoff is fair.,0,2

odhMmAPDc54,"(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\\n\\nJesus said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\\n\\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\\nbut Jesus hid himself, \\nand went out of the temple,\\n\\ngoing through the midst of them, \\nand so passed by.\\n\\n(John 8:58-59).\\n\\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\\n\\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\\n\\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(I AM):\\n\\n(Gk. ego emimi);\\n\\n*(John 6:35)<---And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst).\\n*(John 10:7)<---Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep).\\n*(John 10:14)<---I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine).\\n*(John 15:1)<---I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman).\\n*(John 18:5)<---They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\\n\\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\\n\\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\\n\\nThen answered Jesus \\nand said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \\n\\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\\nfor what things soever he doeth, \\n\\nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\\n\\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\\n\\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \\nand sheweth him all things \\nthat himself doeth:\\n\\nand he will shew him \\ngreater works than these, \\nthat ye may marvel.\\n\\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\\n\\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \\nand quickeneth them; \\neven so the Son quickeneth \\nwhom he will.\\n\\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\\n(John 5:19-21).",0,0

y_nuMEtwUW4,64 teams in the playoff!?  He can't be serious?  He's suggesting that teams make their schedule within that year when they know they won't make the playoff (@6:10).  This seems like a ridiculously difficult setup he's trying to explain.  The only reason he wants a larger playoff is because his team isn't good enough to compete with the top four.  So he argues for a bigger playoff.  He should worry about winning out the season then worry about whether or not the playoff is fair.,0,3

mvuN2LQf09o,From Mark Grant Monterey's New York City AMERICA.... Prince Harry is extremely well-liked in the United States of America. I remember when they found out Harry was serving overseas the first time and because the security reasons they had a problem out and they caught him getting off the plane choking back tears because he did not want to leave his fellows soldiers on the battlefield behind. That was awesome. I like to thank the Royal House and all of Great Britain for their support in the war against terrorism and for supporting the United States of America and we will always be there for you also.

mvuN2LQf09o,"It would also be good to legalize cocaine available by prescription. Sigmund Freud found cocaine helps counter anxiety and depression like nothing else can. Plus cocaine is natural, meaning the body can easily process it and it will not damage the kidneys or liver. Many psyche meds damage the body's internal organs because they are not normally found in nature. The molecules are created int he lab, not in the hills and meadows. A new rule should allow anyone experiencing serious anxiety or depression to get a prescription for cocaine each month from his regular doctor.  :)",0,0
mvuN2LQf09o,"I love the way these videos finish with the excellent black & white footage of the queen in the early days, where she emphasized she is in service to the people. This is similar to how Christ told his followers that he was to serve them. This manner of the monarch serving the people actually traces back to King David (Psalms) and King Solomon (Proverbs). \\n\\nAlthough King Solomon was noted for being the wealthiest of all kings, his wealth was well deserved because he left us with an wonderful set of moral teachings called the Book of Proverbs, which were probably the first real moral psychology teachings since the Ten Commandments five hundred years earlier. King Solomon's Proverbs may be a compilation of all the good moral teachings in the known world at the time, since we see numerous portion of Proverbs containing prayers we know came from Ancient Egypt as well. :)",0,0

odhMmAPDc54,"(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\\n\\nJesus said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\\n\\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\\nbut Jesus hid himself, \\nand went out of the temple,\\n\\ngoing through the midst of them, \\nand so passed by.\\n\\n(John 8:58-59).\\n\\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\\n\\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\\n\\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(I AM):\\n\\n(Gk. ego emimi);\\n\\n*(John 6:35)<---And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst).\\n*(John 10:7)<---Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep).\\n*(John 10:14)<---I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine).\\n*(John 15:1)<---I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman).\\n*(John 18:5)<---They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\\n\\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\\n\\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\\n\\nThen answered Jesus \\nand said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \\n\\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\\nfor what things soever he doeth, \\n\\nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\\n\\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\\n\\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \\nand sheweth him all things \\nthat himself doeth:\\n\\nand he will shew him \\ngreater works than these, \\nthat ye may marvel.\\n\\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\\n\\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \\nand quickeneth them; \\neven so the Son quickeneth \\nwhom he will.\\n\\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\\n(John 5:19-21).",0,0

y_nuMEtwUW4,"If you use bowl games to host playoff sights your viewership and ticket sales would go through the roof. Think about how many more would watch a random mid-December bowl if instead of 2 at large teams you had a 16 vs 1 or a 13 vs 4 match up. Every mid-level bowl would sell out, regardless of whether the 2 teams' fans traveled or not. This should be a no brainer for NCAA football.",0,0

y_nuMEtwUW4,16 team playoff. 11-12 regular season games. 10 Conference Champs + 6 at large. Keep some bowl games for those who have at least 8 wins instead of 6 for side games. Final 4 still as BCS bowl games. Make it happen NCAA.,0,1
y_nuMEtwUW4,64 teams in the playoff!?  He can't be serious?  He's suggesting that teams make their schedule within that year when they know they won't make the playoff (@6:10).  This seems like a ridiculously difficult setup he's trying to explain.  The only reason he wants a larger playoff is because his team isn't good enough to compete with the top four.  So he argues for a bigger playoff.  He should worry about winning out the season then worry about whether or not the playoff is fair.,0,4

y_nuMEtwUW4,What national treasure. He is the most interesting coach in college football. Great personality. I would have loved to play for him.,4,0
y_nuMEtwUW4,I love it! This guy is hilarious.,4,0
y_nuMEtwUW4,"I am more in favor of a 8 team playoff. That would probably eliminate most of the controversy. But the one thing that I believe should be mandatory: if you go unbeaten, you're in. Period. I don't care if it's Bowling Green from the MAC. To go unbeaten in college football is such a rare happenstance that I think you must reward teams¬†who do it. My only worry is that a team like Alabama might schedule three non-league cupcakes, but even there I don't feel Nick Saban would do it because at some point he has to prepare his team for the SEC. If we had multiple teams from the smaller leagues going unbeaten every year I would be against this idea. But it just doesn't happen. We're lucky if we see one.",0,0
y_nuMEtwUW4,"How interesting. Listening to this educated man is far better than listening to that dweeb midget down South, Ain't Nicky Satan at UAT in Tuscaloser.",0,0
y_nuMEtwUW4,Here's my playoff system:\n\n8 team playoff\nAll power 5 Conference champions get automatic bid\n\nBest Group of 5 team gets bid\n\n2 Outsiders get bid (Wildcard teams)\n\nSo with 2016 scenario here's how it would have worked.\n\n1. Alabama\n2. Clemson\n3. Washington\n4. Penn State\n5. Oklahoma\n\n6. Western Michigan\n\n7. Ohio State\n8. USC,0,0
y_nuMEtwUW4,"I love that Mike Leach is the only person in the whole college football community that has common sense and steps up to say ESPN/College Brass and says that the current system is bologna. The problem is the bowls are involved right now. The bowls operate as such: How many tickets/merchandise can we sell? How big will our TV Ratings be for this matchup? You can't have a playoff system where the 2 final 4 matchups operate this way. You saw this last year with Ohio State and 2014. TCU was not involved in the playoff because their brand doesn't carry the money making weight as Ohio State. 2016, Ohio State was invited to play in the Fiesta Bowl because three reasons: 1. The Ohio State Brand/Alumni base in Scottsdale/Phoenix area. 2. Ohio State played in the Fiesta Bowl the year before against ND and sold out. 3. They played Clemson in 2014 Orange Bowl and bowl organizers were hoping for a close game like that game. Mike Leach is right, the playoffs should be expanded and the opening round games should be on campus while the final 4 should be at 1 site (Dallas, ATL, Los Angeles, New York, Miami etc.). This would allow teams from the south and west coast to finally have to travel to play cold weather games in the north. The bowls can still exist in this system, they would just have the meaning they have now, exhibition match ups. The whole argument that these kids can't take 16 games is invalid. All the divisions and multiple sports have athletes play a lot of games. Why should Division 1 football be different? Let's stop living in this world of make believe of pageantry and Rose Bowl good feelings and just say that the reason is ESPN and a few conferences at the top want to keep all the money.",0,0
y_nuMEtwUW4,"Interesting I agree with Coach Mike Leach. More interesting the 16 team playoff theory has already been examined, published and copyrighted by me. To read more about what Coach Leach and I agree with on the expanded playoff format, you can read the book titled College Football In The BCS Era The Untold Truth Facts, Evidence and Solution author Matthew J Siggelow. Available at Lulu.com. Thanks again Coach Leach. We already connected on Twitter.",0,0
y_nuMEtwUW4,"If you use bowl games to host playoff sights your viewership and ticket sales would go through the roof. Think about how many more would watch a random mid-December bowl if instead of 2 at large teams you had a 16 vs 1 or a 13 vs 4 match up. Every mid-level bowl would sell out, regardless of whether the 2 teams' fans traveled or not. This should be a no brainer for NCAA football.",1,0

y_nuMEtwUW4,"I remember saying this exact thing when I was 12. This is not a hard concept, it's just the schools and NCAA believe they wouldn't make as much money with this method.\\n\\nAlso, do away with preseason rankings. Have faux rankings throughout the season and once the regular season is over, a computer ranks your wins and losses and strength of schedule and you are given your real ranking. Otherwise if team A beats #1 ranked team B in week 2 but then team B finishes the season at 3-9 then team B wasn't really #1 in the nation were they?",0,0

y_nuMEtwUW4,I agree with the 16 team playoff... I refuse to watch another BCS title game until there is at least a 16 team set-up. I‚Äôve been boycotting the BCS for years... I believe the last championship game I watched was when Texas won...,1,9
y_nuMEtwUW4,64 teams in the playoff!?  He can't be serious?  He's suggesting that teams make their schedule within that year when they know they won't make the playoff (@6:10).  This seems like a ridiculously difficult setup he's trying to explain.  The only reason he wants a larger playoff is because his team isn't good enough to compete with the top four.  So he argues for a bigger playoff.  He should worry about winning out the season then worry about whether or not the playoff is fair.,0,4

Terrible but also only those involved know if it has been mismanaged causing death or other unavoidable factors. Many I suspect refused to leave and resources to enforce mandatory evacuations were stretched. Not an easy geographic area to manage either. Condolences to thise who lost a loved one and those who list their homes. Our thought are with you. Stand strong. You will get through this. One tip, brunt photo albums that are somewhat intact and can be be pried open,  in some instances the albums are just melted and sealed. Forcing them open or cutting through the melted seams msy reveal photos beyond the first couple of pages and the last damaged but in between photos are intact. I know this after a friends house fire. Provided some relief.   But things are not important in the end , lives matter. Be safe and look after each other.

One tip, brunt photo albums that are somewhat intact and can be be pried open,  in some instances the albums are just melted and sealed. Forcing them open or cutting through the melted seams msy reveal photos beyond the first couple of pages and the last damaged but in between photos are intact. I know this after a friends house fire.

GT0L3RWQNjw,The reason that it's only 30 seconds long is because the feature is meant to capture game moments. Remember when Xbox introduced that feature by saying Xbox record that?

Ef93WmlEho0,Except that it does work and has worked.  So I'd say it's much more likely it having to do with every single car has a different wheel base so depending on what car you are in the front and rear tire are NOT hitting the same notes.  This is much more likely to effect the song.,0,0

So it's not that they did a bad job on it and messed up. It's just that they made it for one car specifically. So if you have a car with almost the same wheel base as that model Civic, then you should be able to listen to it right. And also think about it. No matter how far or close the grooves are. There are so many different model cars with so many different wheel bases. So no matter how right you think his calculations are.

thUp8jTeJ9Q,The higher end stuff will have the cello wrap.Be careful and the makeup you can cut the top of it off some if its been used.And someone said to watch using the nail polish if its been used before you could take your own in and they will use it on you as not to use the one every one else uses and take it home when your done.But they put nail polish remover in theirs if it gets to tacky so the chemicals alone would maybe kill the germs in it but I don't know but I will ask my friend who went to school for it and I'm sure she will know and I will come back and let you all know if anyone wants.,0,0
