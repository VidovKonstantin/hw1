Alp_a88C8dY,Actually you guys are wrong. A girl did get murdered and grown up Mike Hanlon did found a picture of Georgie near the crime scene. The picture has been missing since Bill and Richie went back to check Georgie's moving and winking picture. Finding this photo is in fact the deciding factor for Mike to believe that IT did returned and called up the others. This is quite important in the book and the picture had driven a lot of flash back so I don't know how you could have missed it if you did read the book.,1,0

T2W7UocH0Hs,"In Poland (and probbably in most other countries) it is common to save your spot by putting a shirt or a coat, an umbrella or a bag. Yet you should not leave any valuables (also in said bag) as they might get stolen.

At event's the best seats are reserved for the elderly and accomplished. Besides that we share so well nobody would hold a thought that was stingy or aggressive. It's more about the activity.:),0,0

One day I was at a mall where I left my bag with two items I bought and thinking someone would return it to lost and found but apparently it was take so I had to rebuy. What I do is when I am alone I don't ever save seats because its pointless however if I am with someone then I have that person save us a seat while I take orders for both of us if its take out or if its order in than me and the person I am with whether it is with my hubby friend or family will take turns to use restroom.,0,0

Just because Japan is extremely safe doesn't mean it is 100% safe.\\nLiving there for years, I became aware of some incidents of theft. However, I will always say that Japan is a great place to travel solo, as crime is extremely minimal. You can use backpacks or bags behind you without any real fear if being ripped off. You don't have to worry about someone rummaging in your bags while you get your wallet to pay. If you ask someone for directions, or look at a map, or otherwise be distracted, you are extremely unlikely to be taken advantage of. But you're still not 100% safe. Don't tempt fate.",0,0

You haven't been paying attention if you're just realizing this now. Brooks Wackerman seems to be a big help in their continued growth. No disrespect to Arin Ilejay, a monster drummer who stepped in when they needed him most but I was worried it wouldn't last. His inexperience and lack of a broad musical background would make it hard.  Plus that was a very hard and trying time for Avenged. This too is probably part of the healing process.",0,0

Franco's inflections and mannerism (from this admittedly short preview) are at times very Wiseau-like while others seem so far removed from Tommy it is off-putting. However, I am usually skeptical regarding things I am very fond of, so I am still excited despite my concerns.\\n\\nI will say I am more excited for Best F(r)iends and the possible small part Tommy plays in this movie. 😉",0,0

4Yue-q9Jdbk,"Okay so of course I felt like shit when this came out unplanned and it was because my day leading up to it was shit. So in chemistry we had to sit through a carbon video having to do with elements WHY I DONT KNOW but that's why school is pointless and you feel dumb every fucking day and all the time if you do something wrong. And then my second period I already wasn't in the mood to be there cause I felt like shit from the class before and I'm love lonely so then this guy's all talking about this mattress fundraiser and when class was over I'm all briefly saying hi and then the teacher comes over and he's all You're gonna be late you can't talk to __________ everyday. You're being nice to people which is fine but (get the fuck out) was what he was trying to tell me so then I'm all pissed because it's like Um bitch do you not get in suicidal and this is the only way I'm not suffering from child abuse? The only reason why I can't do cheer, or why I can't be in choir next semester or why I can't be happy or why I can't be in react and show my good to the world is because the abuse I'm getting is suppressing me enough to where I'm gonna commit suicide if I'm forced out of choir all because I'm being me and my abusers aren't ready for me to be myself which is stupid because they're jeopardizing my health and I want them to go to Prision and I'm boarder line gonna fuck them up and I don't want them in my life and to me Johnny the music teacher sounded like a shitty parent. Like there's a reason why I shut down and can't trust him I don't wanna cause attention to myself by saying that my brother molested me because I don't think he'll ever believe me and I don't think he ever cared about me and that he only called me Jerid all because he didn't want to lose his job. A lot of me too feels like he never did like me and always thought I was annoying as fuck and that I couldn't do shit right and I don't talk to him about it because I can't trust him and I can't trust him because of my brother. Like I do wanna have trust in a person of them saying We're not just gonna give up if they don't accept you but my life will never be the same again and my life will always be tourcher cause of that and they've only tried to offer counciling but I've always turned it down cause I've lived this far without them I can handle it I'm a big boy but they're only gonna offer it so I don't commit suicide and then they end up getting sued from parent to school but then if I did die then I'd be blamed for everything, blamed for dieing blamed for being transgender in the first place, blamed for being gay like I'm not gonna take it I deserve better and there's only so much I can take but I'm tired of the same people not calling me Jerid and all that but all my dad does is beat me and he tells me Jared Folgel comments and subway sandwhich comments and comments of you're weird stop being it, just today he goes Don't be the weird kid meaning I can't see you as a son and you're an embarrassment and I'm scared for you when really he doesn't wanna admit he's a fucking pussy and not handling me like a real man should cause he doesn't say I love you. He never taught me about boys he's made me ashamed of me he's made me think everything I do is wrong and I've stopped being on twitter because I wanna be myself. Like to me that's not a real father that's a pussy ass man that needs real fucking boxers and actually pay attention to me for once in his life. And will I ever tell Johnny any of this shit FUCK NO.... I can't trust his ass one second to even think he can fix anything like my god. So you can assume what happens next after this. There's this girl that knows the birthname but she's too much of a fucking pussy to go into deep water and god I wanted to start a fight with her so bad one time cause she cant stop bitching and it reminds me of too much of Rita so why the fuck would I ever be around her? So I end up on this court with her and she ends up telling me Hey go play like on my partner's court, so then I'm like \\nNo. And then she eventually goes I'm gonna tell. And then I'm all You're gonna snitch? She goes Yeh like all bitches do. And I'm all Cause that's all you ever were? And before all that I'm like saying a fuck bomb or something I don't remember what it was, and then before she could complain about me I'm already on my game saying \\nI'm not playing well whenever she's on the court with me and she's not nice to me. And she damn well knows I'm a boy and uses she and I'm like She's not even using my pronouns and so then the teacher was asking what I wanted to do and I said that I didn't want to at least be on her court so then a friend comes by and goes to play with me for the rest of class and it was cute I liked it. And then I was thinking to myself after all this Hey I wonder if Superfruit is gonna come on today I wonder so then in the middle of class and there being a sub I end up crying in class because I felt like everything was better and I didn't have to be all nuts anymore. Mitch made me okay. It was like I ended up having a drug that I went cold turkey on and then felt better. And then after that was lunch and math and after that is a teacher I hate so then I'm all wanting to go switch out teachers but I filled a request days ago so like I highly doubt that it went in already but yeh.",0,1

Back when I was in school in 1997-8 or there abouts we had under 21 game in the city and someone left a foil wrapped sandwich in the toilet for us to have a nice bomb alert.  There also time in the early 200s when a old lady (I think she was Indian) found her suitcase was too heavy and just left it outside the bank so they closed half the city centre off for like 3 hours or so. \\nAnd as another thought remember 7/7, that was done with bombs in backpacks.\\n\\nWith that as a background  imagine my fear and thinking to seeing  bags being left lying around in a USA bus station, where I seen it a few times, hell I did once. But my favourite thing was in Vancouver bus station when on being told not to leave my bag around, I said yes because you blow it up.

T2W7UocH0Hs,In the USA if you leave your stuff anywhere be prepared it will be taken that is unless someone so kind with a good heart will return it to where someone can retrieve it easily. One day I was at a mall where I left my bag with two items I bought and thinking someone would return it to lost and found but apparently it was take so I had to rebuy. What I do is when I am alone I don't ever save seats because its pointless however if I am with someone then I have that person save us a seat while I take orders for both of us if its take out or if its order in than me and the person I am with whether it is with my hubby friend or family will take turns to use restroom.,0,0

Just because Japan is extremely safe doesn't mean it is 100% safe.\\nLiving there for years, I became aware of some incidents of theft. However, I will always say that Japan is a great place to travel solo, as crime is extremely minimal. You can use backpacks or bags behind you without any real fear if being ripped off. You don't have to worry about someone rummaging in your bags while you get your wallet to pay. If you ask someone for directions, or look at a map, or otherwise be distracted, you are extremely unlikely to be taken advantage of. But you're still not 100% safe. Don't tempt fate.",0,0

WAKE UP & accept forgiveness of your sins through Jesus' agonizing death on the cross. He paid the price of our sins freely out of His deep LOVE for us. Man has turned from our Lord God in blatant disobedience calling evil good and good evil & we are under His judgment. He is a loving Father, but also a righteous Judge. REPENT before it's too late. You do not want to be left behind. Cry out to Jesus today & ask Him to be Lord over your life then turn from sin. If left behind you can still accept Jesus as your Savior, but you'll endure the wrath of God & Satan during the Great Tribulation which will be unfathomable. Be also forewarned to NOT take the mark of the beast (perhaps the RFID chip or bar code in righthand or forehead required to buy or sell), for those who do cannot be saved. The Lord God gave us free will so the choice is ours, but let those who have ears hear.

t4QwhVt5Zk0,"Time is running out..... Jesus Christ will return soon for His bride (church) 1 Thess. 4:13-18 (by catching up in the clouds). WAKE UP & accept forgiveness of your sins through Jesus' agonizing death on the cross. He paid the price of our sins freely out of His deep LOVE for us. Man has turned from our Lord God in blatant disobedience calling evil good and good evil & we are under His judgment. He is a loving Father, but also a righteous Judge. REPENT before it's too late. You do not want to be left behind. Cry out to Jesus today & ask Him to be Lord over your life then turn from sin. If left behind you can still accept Jesus as your Savior, but you'll endure the wrath of God & Satan during the Great Tribulation which will be unfathomable. Be also forewarned to NOT take the mark of the beast (perhaps the RFID chip or bar code in righthand or forehead required to buy or sell), for those who do cannot be saved. The Lord God gave us free will so the choice is ours, but let those who have ears hear. May the Lord establish His Word Reference: (John 5:24-30;  Eph. 2:1-10,I Thes.4:9-5:11, Zech. 2:8-9, Rev.3:22, Rev. 7:9-17)  I recommend YouTube channel & website informedchristians for info on Biblical signs of Jesus' return, Christian living,  etc.",1,0

t4QwhVt5Zk0,"Time is running out..... Jesus Christ will return soon for His bride (church) 1 Thess. 4:13-18 (by catching up in the clouds). WAKE UP & accept forgiveness of your sins through Jesus' agonizing death on the cross. He paid the price of our sins freely out of His deep LOVE for us. Man has turned from our Lord God in blatant disobedience calling evil good and good evil & we are under His judgment. He is a loving Father, but also a righteous Judge. REPENT before it's too late. You do not want to be left behind. Cry out to Jesus today & ask Him to be Lord over your life then turn from sin. If left behind you can still accept Jesus as your Savior, but you'll endure the wrath of God & Satan during the Great Tribulation which will be unfathomable. Be also forewarned to NOT take the mark of the beast (perhaps the RFID chip or bar code in righthand or forehead required to buy or sell), for those who do cannot be saved. The Lord God gave us free will so the choice is ours, but let those who have ears hear. May the Lord establish His Word Reference: (John 5:24-30;  Eph. 2:1-10,I Thes.4:9-5:11, Zech. 2:8-9, Rev.3:22, Rev. 7:9-17)  I recommend YouTube channel & website informedchristians for info on Biblical signs of Jesus' return, Christian living,  etc.",1,0

4Yue-q9Jdbk,"They are very consciously positive & I think that is something a lot of people react to, there is so much negativity out there.  Pentatonix as a group & Superfruit both have that same positive energy of creative people doing what they love and it's like they use all their energy doing that instead of worrying about what everyone else thinks.   A great example of this is, is when they'd say thank  you every time one of the teens complimented them like they don't assume everyone is going to like their stuff and are still surprised when people do.",1,0

4Yue-q9Jdbk,"Okay so of course I felt like shit when this came out unplanned and it was because my day leading up to it was shit. So in chemistry we had to sit through a carbon video having to do with elements WHY I DONT KNOW but that's why school is pointless and you feel dumb every fucking day and all the time if you do something wrong. And then my second period I already wasn't in the mood to be there cause I felt like shit from the class before and I'm love lonely so then this guy's all talking about this mattress fundraiser and when class was over I'm all briefly saying hi and then the teacher comes over and he's all You're gonna be late you can't talk to __________ everyday. You're being nice to people which is fine but (get the fuck out) was what he was trying to tell me so then I'm all pissed because it's like Um bitch do you not get in suicidal and this is the only way I'm not suffering from child abuse? The only reason why I can't do cheer, or why I can't be in choir next semester or why I can't be happy or why I can't be in react and show my good to the world is because the abuse I'm getting is suppressing me enough to where I'm gonna commit suicide if I'm forced out of choir all because I'm being me and my abusers aren't ready for me to be myself which is stupid because they're jeopardizing my health and I want them to go to Prision and I'm boarder line gonna fuck them up and I don't want them in my life and to me Johnny the music teacher sounded like a shitty parent. Like there's a reason why I shut down and can't trust him I don't wanna cause attention to myself by saying that my brother molested me because I don't think he'll ever believe me and I don't think he ever cared about me and that he only called me Jerid all because he didn't want to lose his job. A lot of me too feels like he never did like me and always thought I was annoying as fuck and that I couldn't do shit right and I don't talk to him about it because I can't trust him and I can't trust him because of my brother. Like I do wanna have trust in a person of them saying We're not just gonna give up if they don't accept you but my life will never be the same again and my life will always be tourcher cause of that and they've only tried to offer counciling but I've always turned it down cause I've lived this far without them I can handle it I'm a big boy but they're only gonna offer it so I don't commit suicide and then they end up getting sued from parent to school but then if I did die then I'd be blamed for everything, blamed for dieing blamed for being transgender in the first place, blamed for being gay like I'm not gonna take it I deserve better and there's only so much I can take but I'm tired of the same people not calling me Jerid and all that but all my dad does is beat me and he tells me Jared Folgel comments and subway sandwhich comments and comments of you're weird stop being it, just today he goes Don't be the weird kid meaning I can't see you as a son and you're an embarrassment and I'm scared for you when really he doesn't wanna admit he's a fucking pussy and not handling me like a real man should cause he doesn't say I love you. He never taught me about boys he's made me ashamed of me he's made me think everything I do is wrong and I've stopped being on twitter because I wanna be myself. Like to me that's not a real father that's a pussy ass man that needs real fucking boxers and actually pay attention to me for once in his life. And will I ever tell Johnny any of this shit FUCK NO.... I can't trust his ass one second to even think he can fix anything like my god. So you can assume what happens next after this. There's this girl that knows the birthname but she's too much of a fucking pussy to go into deep water and god I wanted to start a fight with her so bad one time cause she cant stop bitching and it reminds me of too much of Rita so why the fuck would I ever be around her? So I end up on this court with her and she ends up telling me Hey go play like on my partner's court, so then I'm like \\nNo. And then she eventually goes I'm gonna tell. And then I'm all You're gonna snitch? She goes Yeh like all bitches do. And I'm all Cause that's all you ever were? And before all that I'm like saying a fuck bomb or something I don't remember what it was, and then before she could complain about me I'm already on my game saying \\nI'm not playing well whenever she's on the court with me and she's not nice to me. And she damn well knows I'm a boy and uses she and I'm like She's not even using my pronouns and so then the teacher was asking what I wanted to do and I said that I didn't want to at least be on her court so then a friend comes by and goes to play with me for the rest of class and it was cute I liked it. And then I was thinking to myself after all this Hey I wonder if Superfruit is gonna come on today I wonder so then in the middle of class and there being a sub I end up crying in class because I felt like everything was better and I didn't have to be all nuts anymore. Mitch made me okay. It was like I ended up having a drug that I went cold turkey on and then felt better. And then after that was lunch and math and after that is a teacher I hate so then I'm all wanting to go switch out teachers but I filled a request days ago so like I highly doubt that it went in already but yeh.",0,1

I was hoping for a horror movie-I got a big movie about religious allegories. Yeah. It's a good movie for sure and I appreciate how different it was. However, when I go to a horror movies-I'd like to be scared and I'd like a movie that makes sense. I think I'll re-watch Black Swan and The Witch.

t4QwhVt5Zk0,"Time is running out..... Jesus Christ will return soon for His bride (church) 1 Thess. 4:13-18 (by catching up in the clouds). WAKE UP & accept forgiveness of your sins through Jesus' agonizing death on the cross. He paid the price of our sins freely out of His deep LOVE for us. Man has turned from our Lord God in blatant disobedience calling evil good and good evil & we are under His judgment. He is a loving Father, but also a righteous Judge. REPENT before it's too late. You do not want to be left behind. Cry out to Jesus today & ask Him to be Lord over your life then turn from sin. If left behind you can still accept Jesus as your Savior, but you'll endure the wrath of God & Satan during the Great Tribulation which will be unfathomable. Be also forewarned to NOT take the mark of the beast (perhaps the RFID chip or bar code in righthand or forehead required to buy or sell), for those who do cannot be saved. The Lord God gave us free will so the choice is ours, but let those who have ears hear. May the Lord establish His Word Reference: (John 5:24-30;  Eph. 2:1-10,I Thes.4:9-5:11, Zech. 2:8-9, Rev.3:22, Rev. 7:9-17)  I recommend YouTube channel & website informedchristians for info on Biblical signs of Jesus' return, Christian living,  etc.",1,0

If the tribes of Isreal ,as well as the 'gentiles''(all other nationalities), will be ripped out of the land ! Do you see the floods in all continents in different provinces ! Our Father God of Isreal curses as a punishment to the sinners who refuse to accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior !Out of Pure love , this message a warning to many of you, who walk in sin ! Turn your hearts and lives !, Confess with your mouths that Jesus is Lord and Savior! Pray to be forgiven ! Doing so you will become a full Christian , but you must then afterward stay loyal and keep the Law which was given to Moses! Its Written in Exodus ! Stay Loyal to the true living God Of Isreal till the end ! Glorify his Holy name with a honest and innocent heart joyfully ! It's written those who trust in the Lord, are truly happy ,In book of psalms! By keeping loyal in full reverence !, to our Lord Jesus Christ ,the son of man .Who is the light, the truth and the way to enter the Holy Kingdom of heaven. To inheriting eternal life !

Believe and become a  Christian in a prayer of forgiveness ,to our Father God Jahova ! , Ending the prayer in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ Amen!

But ignoring our Gods offer to live according to your own will , Its a warning to all man and women in all nations. These are the end days ! Revelation is here! Don't get caught in sin by ignoring this message of our Gods Instructions to surrender your lives and live by faith! Keep The Ten Commandments as it's the way to eternal salvation !

t4QwhVt5Zk0,"Time is running out..... Jesus Christ will return soon for His bride (church) 1 Thess. 4:13-18 (by catching up in the clouds). WAKE UP & accept forgiveness of your sins through Jesus' agonizing death on the cross. He paid the price of our sins freely out of His deep LOVE for us. Man has turned from our Lord God in blatant disobedience calling evil good and good evil & we are under His judgment. He is a loving Father, but also a righteous Judge. REPENT before it's too late. You do not want to be left behind. Cry out to Jesus today & ask Him to be Lord over your life then turn from sin. If left behind you can still accept Jesus as your Savior, but you'll endure the wrath of God & Satan during the Great Tribulation which will be unfathomable. Be also forewarned to NOT take the mark of the beast (perhaps the RFID chip or bar code in righthand or forehead required to buy or sell), for those who do cannot be saved. The Lord God gave us free will so the choice is ours, but let those who have ears hear. May the Lord establish His Word Reference: (John 5:24-30;  Eph. 2:1-10,I Thes.4:9-5:11, Zech. 2:8-9, Rev.3:22, Rev. 7:9-17)  I recommend YouTube channel & website informedchristians for info on Biblical signs of Jesus' return, Christian living,  etc.",1,0

SLoQoYi3P5U,"Jesus is coming back real soon. Jesus Loves U and he wants U to have a deep relationship with him and truly follow him. Following Jesus is the only way to make it to Heaven. Accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour and give him your heart and soul. Jesus is the son of God who created us all, he is our Lord and Saviour. Jesus is God, he is one with the Father. (John 10:30) God sent Jesus to the Earth to die for our sins to be washed away so we could make it to Heaven. The Bible tells us that if we believe in Jesus we will be saved but there are other things Jesus told us we have to do to be saved. We have to do his will. \\nHere are the things we have to do to be saved and make it to Heaven. I'm gonna list the Bible scriptures for everything and U can read the scriptures yourself and do your own research.\\n1. We have to believe that Jesus is is the son of God and that he is our Lord and Saviour. (John 3:16)\\n2. We have to accept him as our Lord and Saviour and believe that God raised him from the dead. (Romans 10:9)\\n3. Repent from all our sins. (2 Chronicles 7:14)\\n4. Be baptized in the name of Jesus. (Acts 2:38)\\n5. We have to have a deep relationship with him and pray to him and talk to him everyday. The only way to the Father is thru him. (John 14:6)\\n6. Read the Bible and learn the word of God. (Joshua 1:8)\\n7. Fast and pray. (Joel 2:12)\\n8. Speak the word of God to the ppl of the world. (Mark 16:15)\\n9. Do the Lord's will until we die. (Matthew 24:13)\\nOn Judgement day when we go before Jesus there will be many ppl who have prayed to Jesus and even done things in his name and Jesus will say to them depart from me I never knew U and they will go to Hell. This is why We have to have a deep relationship with Jesus and try to do everything he told us to do cause thats the only way we will make it to Heaven. (Matthew 7:20-23). We all fall short of the Glory of God and we are all sinners. (Romans 3:23) This is why Jesus came and died for our sins to be washed away so we could make it to Heaven. (Peter 3:18) Without Jesus we are doomed to Hell. (John 3:36) When we disobey God and sin, God curses us. (Galatians 3:10) God punishes us and puts curses on us to make us obedient to him cause he Loves us and wants us to do right. (Hebrews 12:6) Jesus sets us free from curses when we truly follow him. (Romans 8:2) Quit following everything else in the world like the Government, religion, schools, science, TV, movies, radio, and everything else. (Colossians 2:8) That is all ran by the Devil and his worshippers, the Illuminati. They lie to U and deceive U. Them and the fallen Angels who got kicked out of Heaven with Satan are trying to lead U to Hell. (Ephesians 6:12) \\nPut God 1st in your life. Never put anyone or anything before God, not your family friends job money or anything. (Matthew 6:33) If U Love Jesus then U hate evil. (Proverbs 8:13) Repent from all your sins. Pray to Jesus everyday. Pray to him for everything U need. (John 15:7) Pray to him and ask for forgiveness of your sins, thank him for everything. (Philippians 4:6)  Pray to him to heal U, give U peace, joy, strength, courage, protection, wisdom, knowledge, understanding, patience, direction, guidance, and for him to show U the truth. (Jeremiah 33:3) Do the Lord's will and he will answer your prayers.  (John 9:31) God gives us visions and he talks to us in dreams and shows us things. (Acts 2:17) When U die U will go before Jesus and he will judge U and either let U into Heaven or send U to Hell based on if U did his will. Those who don't do the Lord's will they will be sent to Hell. (Revelation 20:15) Hell is place where ppl will be punished and burn for eternity (Matthew 25:46) Heaven is a place that God has for the ppl who truly Love him. It is eternal paradise where U will be wit Jesus, the Angels, all the animals, and God's ppl forever. God says there will be no more death, we will have eternal life. We will not feel sorrow, we will not cry, and there will be no more pain. (Revelation 21:4) God says that we can't even imagine how amazing Heaven will be. (1 Corinthians 2:9) In Heaven we live forever, rejoice and be joyful forever. (Revelations 22:1-5)",0,2

Man has turned from our Lord God in blatant disobedience calling evil good and good evil & we are under His judgment. He is a loving Father, but also a righteous Judge. REPENT before it's too late. You do not want to be left behind. Cry out to Jesus today & ask Him to be Lord over your life then turn from sin. If left behind you can still accept Jesus as your Savior, but you'll endure the wrath of God & Satan during the Great Tribulation which will be unfathomable. Be also forewarned to NOT take the mark of the beast (perhaps the RFID chip or bar code in righthand or forehead required to buy or sell), for those who do cannot be saved.

jKInAMNrXRA,"• Trump boasted that “unemployment is at its lowest level in 16 years.” True, but it is a continuation of a years-long trend that predates his election.\\n\\n• Trump misleadingly claimed that “we have more people working in the United States today than ever before.” Since the population constantly increases, that’s not unusual. The employment-to-population ratio isn’t higher “than ever before” — it was higher every month between September 1985 and February 2009.\\n\\n• The president wrongly claimed companies are “moving back, creating job growth the likes of which our country has not seen in a very long time.” Jobs have been steadily increasing every month for years. In fact, the job gains have been fewer under Trump than they were during the same time frame in each of the previous four years.\\n\\n\\n• Trump boasted that “the stock market is at an all-time high” since Election Day. True, but it has reached new heights regularly since March 5, 2013, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped the previous record set in October 2007.\\n\\n• Trump said the U.S. “has achieved more against ISIS in the last eight months than it has in many, many years combined.” ISIS territory has been reclaimed at a faster rate under Trump, but more territory was reclaimed from early 2015 to early 2017.\\n\\n• The president said the United States “continues to lead the world in humanitarian assistance.” That’s true by volume, but not as a percentage of gross national income, or GNI, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. As a percentage of GNI, the U.S. ranks 20th out of 28 OECD member countries.\\n\\n• Trump got ahead of himself when he said “we will be spending almost $700 billion on our military and defense.” The Senate passed a nearly $700 billion defense authorization bill, but it must be reconciled with a House version. And lawmakers still have to pass a separate bill appropriating the money.",0,0

jKInAMNrXRA,I was a little skeptical of trump I mean who can't be with the way he gets upset about things and takes it personal but at the same time he has no political background so I had to give him a break on that and there's a few things I don't agree with that he wants to do but there is no way that you feel one hundred percent about any president but I did vote for him and I think he's just trying to play the same game as North Korea because I think that's all they really know how to do is threaten people with words but at the same time if they threaten any of our allies or us I completely agree with parts of taking out North Korea but I don't feel we should take out the whole country.,0,0

Our minimum wage is a joke, our FDA is a joke and there is massive corruption amongst politicians and wall street. All existed before trump and will be there after.

They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\\n\\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\\n\\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\\n\\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\\n\\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\\n\\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\\n\\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\\n\\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\\n\\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\\n\\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\\n\\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\\n\\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\\n\\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \\n\\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\\n\\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",0,0

(Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\\n\\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\\n\\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\\n\\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\\n\\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\\n\\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\\n\\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\\n\\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\\n\\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\\n\\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\\n\\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\\n\\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\\n\\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \\n\\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\\n\\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",0,0

Like texting, eating a hot dog, turning around to talk to someone, looking at a bird in the sky, taking a selfie or having children in a hot zone for foul balls. etc. regardless of all that and placing blame. #1 SAFETY Every single stadium should have safety nets in these zones.. Post big signs in concession area. may get hit with ball if not paying attention. and show warning on stadium big screen and monitors. This seems to be becoming a big problem.There are things that can be done to help prevent this in the future Duh.",0,0

F5Ma-1A-NS0,"As a father of 3 children I couldn't imagine.  Terrible thing to have happen.  With that said it's baseball, and there are times where errand balls can get into the stands whether it be off the bat of a player or a overthrown ball or otherwise.  Part of the charm of a ball game is where kids get tossed foul balls from the players etc.  You put screens in that goes away, at least for that section.   \\n\\nThat's a terrible accident but I'm alittle torn on the idea of screens.  I can see the merit, but I'm not 100% for it either.  FYI, I grew up playing baseball and played competitively in various leagues into my early 20's.  I'm unfortunately aware of what can happen.  Part of the problem is also that many of these players now are hitting the ball quite a bit harder than the preceding players did on average.  Another issue is fans are distracted way too much.  I was watching a minor league game with my kids and a foul ball was ripped into my section.  A 15 year old girl took it right in the side of the head because she was talking to her friends and not watching the game.  The ball was hooking pretty hard from the side spin on the ball as well.  It was a wicked shot, and this was about 1/2 way down the outfield line on the 1st base side well past where they say many of the screens usually are in these parks.  Unfortunately they took her out on a stretcher.    \\n\\nSo not sure if screens are really the right answer.  Hockey is different.  Hockey the puck very seldom gets more and a few feet of elevation.  In baseball it's quiet common for a ball to be hit 100 or so feet up into the air if not more.  There is a much different 3rd dimension (altitude/height) that you have to account for in baseball.",0,0

That being said, the guys are bigger, stronger, and the velocity of the balls flying into the stands is higher than it has ever been and there is no way in hell that little kids and the rest of the fans in attendance  should not be protected from injury by flying bats and foul balls. I truly love this game but it is criminally NEGLIGENT not to put up the netting regardless of whether or not they put a disclaimer on the back of a ticket stub.",0,0
F5Ma-1A-NS0,I just don't get all the protection stuff. It sucks that the girl was hurt but you simply cannot prevent all injuries. It's a known risk going in. If someone trips on the stairs at the stadiums are the stairs safe? What about at little league games where a catcher can get hit in the head with a bat? I've seen many children get foul ball's landing on or close to them at every little league game. What about when the ball breaks the windshield of a car? What if there is a parent in that car and glass cuts them up? Should cars park a mile away? What about if the kid gets hit in the stomach in the infield? Should all the kids now wear pillows? What if the player hits a light fixture ant the lights fall killing 9 people? No more night games! Cant have lights! What if the roof falls. Or a ball or bat breaks through a weak part of the net? It's simply impossible to stay 100% safe. If you don't want to risk it then dont go! It's that easy. It's not rocket science.,0,0

If you use physics to calculate the angle the ball was hit and the velocity of the ball, then you may or may not have ample time to react. Yes it's sad that the toddler got hit, but they can't put up nets that are X feet tall. That just eliminates foul balls which can drastically change baseball. MLB always made the stadiums put on their tickets that foul balls and bats will be thrown accidentally into the crowd. Anyone attending the game are accepting that risk so that means that MLB and/or the stadium can't get sued. It's that simple. If you get hit, then that just really sucks for you, but no one should be blamed for any of it because it is, again, AN ACCIDENT.",0,0

UuOAs0IiEI0,I pretty much do this everyday but the only difference is I use a creamy white or taupey shade in my inner corners and with a flat brush bring it right up to the sides of the nose right next to the eye this REALLY REALLY helps with maken your eyes look bigger and more awake!!! Then I'll bring the same color on the lower lash line just to about the middle of it then I'll blend either my bronzer or some darker shade in the crease and outer corner and wrap it down to where the cream color stops just so it doesn't look so stark white!! It works BEAUTIFULLY!! You looked beautiful hunny where did you get that CC cream??? Can you get it at the drugstore?????? And is it just one universal shade or is there multiple????,1,0

Yes bad weather will effect it's usibility but then those same weather conditions effect the drones capabilities too.

SLoQoYi3P5U,"(((Homosexuality is an abomination before a Holy God. If they dont repent and stop doing this sinful act they will not inherit the kingdom of God. Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \\nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\\n\\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\\n\\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\\n\\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\\n\\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\\n\\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\\n\\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\\n\\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\\n\\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\\n\\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\\n\\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\\n\\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\\n\\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \\n\\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\\n\\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",0,0

JU21shbaVBo,The Baloo/Robin Hood shot you're looking for is around 8:00. What was the first Disney movie you saw where you thought you'd seen a shot before? What did we miss?,32,6
JU21shbaVBo,"Oh god , i didn't notice all that",0,1
JU21shbaVBo,I really don't blame them for reusing shots for the animals... they're a pain in the backside to draw.,177,1
JU21shbaVBo,The perfect case of work smarter not harder,27,1
JU21shbaVBo,Fun Fact: All of Toy Story's 3 characters were all new 3D models.,16,0
JU21shbaVBo,"Disney barely retraced, if you compare frames you can see it was only used the film as reference, not rotoscoping... 2 extremely different things.\\nReference is still used today in 3D animation, just as used in Alice in Wonderland.",9,0
JU21shbaVBo,13:00 Oh yeah!!,10,0
JU21shbaVBo,"As a professional cgi modeller,  I have to say, it is a lot harder to reuse a model than it sounds. \\n\\nFor one thing, each production has a different style so things aren't likely to fit without edits. Productions can also be at different scales, or built for characters with different proportions. Your tall chair for a long legged character will look odd for a new short big-headed child\\n\\nBut the main problem is the organization. Every studio, but even every project, can have its own methods. New props need their own file folders and organizations within those folders. Each piece of the prop has certain names and groupings. Do you keep the pieces separate or weld them together? Do you instance them? Does the modeler create a uv map or is that someone else's job? How many edge loops are there? Should there be more faces and details or less? Quads or triangles?\\n\\nOne production I had got all the old models from another company and we had to reorganize EVERYTHING. It took AGES.\\n\\nOnce again, it really is easier to start from scratch\\n\\nEdit: Just to add to that, it would also take ages to find anything amongst old files too. Everything is named short-formed. And I didn't even mention different software and the fact that Maya alone makes a new version every year. The versions aren't compatible. My company has projects on 2013 and others on 2015",48,1
JU21shbaVBo,"The early movies you used as examples of rotoscoping are blatantly not. You can see it in the timing, how it doesn't exactly match: The live action footage was shot for REFERENCE, not to be traced. They still do that to this day, in EVERY animation studio that is worth their salt. - an irritated animator",102,7
JU21shbaVBo,"This TOTALLY explains why I used to get the animated Robin Hood and a Jungle Book confused with how Baloo is supposed to look. Hahaha, great video! I love animation~",31,0
JU21shbaVBo,2:41 BAMBI WAS A FAILURE?!?!?!,9,1
JU21shbaVBo,I hope Disney does some more 2D movies. They can be really beautiful 😊,11,1
JU21shbaVBo,"I always noticed it as a little girl and thought it was a cute nod to other movies. Its never bothered me as a kid or an adult. And I kinda like it when its small things like dogs licking faces, dancing, etc.  Its a cute nod to prior movies and easter eggs before easter eggs were a thing",8,0
JU21shbaVBo,"Idk why people get so worked up about it, its not like they're ripping off the entire idea, its just taking one idea and remaking it into something new because making anything from scratch is tedious work",8,0
JU21shbaVBo,Kinda like how Iron Man and the first Avengers movie share a scene. The one where the Hulk chases after Black Widow was recycled.,3,0
JU21shbaVBo,"I think the wilhelm scream is at this point just used as a joke/homage. At least in the case of star wars. As that was the series that, in my opinion, made it pretty mainstream.",7,3

JU21shbaVBo,I notice recently on the X Men Evolution animated show that the sound that Iceman used was exactly the same as what Daleks sounded like when exterminating.,0,0
JU21shbaVBo,"The crying of Baby Kate, from Arthur, is used a lot and in Little House on the Prairie they use the same kids playing background a lot throughout the show",0,0
JU21shbaVBo,"A lot of the dates for the movies are wrong. I was trying to figure out how Pocahontas could take something from the Lion King if it came out 3 years earlier, then remembered how old I was when Pocahontas came out and noticed the dates. It happens several times in the video, like saying Robin Hood borrowed scenes from Alice in wonderland then inverting the year (1973, not 1937)",0,0
JU21shbaVBo,I always thought it was an Easter egg when we see recycled animation. A nice little surprise 👽,0,0
JU21shbaVBo,"As much as I love these new fangled 3D movies, I really miss drawn or 2d animation in movies.",0,0
JU21shbaVBo,I don't really care if they recycle here and there because the quality not only of the animation but the storytelling is enough work as it is.,0,0

JU21shbaVBo,"This was a cool video! I was a bit disappointed though, as the title mislead me to believe that Frozen, Toy Story, Moana all did recycled animation as well.",2,0
JU21shbaVBo,3D models is one thing but rigging that stuff is another world so if you can use same animal or humanoid who already have full rig and just swap textures or additional things it's very usefull. Rigging is hard.,0,0
JU21shbaVBo,Well recycled animations from the same characters in the same tv series is completely passable for that scooby doo part.,0,0
JU21shbaVBo,The Adventures of Ichabod and Toad. That movie scared the shit out of me when I was waaaaaay younger. It's the reason why I have an irrational phobia of horses,0,0
JU21shbaVBo,Animation shortcuts are also the reason why:\n\n- Anime protagonists usually sit in the back of the classroom by the window; so the artists don't have to draw all the other desks and students around them.\n- Naruto characters run with their arms back.\n- Evangelion has multiple long distance shots of the characters sitting/standing and talking.,0,0
JU21shbaVBo,"13:15 is the guy on the right supposed to somehow resemble Bill? like the hair color and eyebrow shape are(almost) the same, but other than that its clearly a different character who vaguely resembles somebody else. sort of like how REAL LIFE is full of similar looking people, so whats wrong with Pokemon doing it? (also that severe lack of detail on the right makes it look like less of re-use if anything.)",0,0

JU21shbaVBo,"With Hana-Barbara television animation reusing assets was their trademark.  In a process very similar to how modern Flash or animation software suits work, they would draw individual assets to a cell, then layer them on top of background cells. These background cells would include whole body shots, with the only thing layered on top of the was the moving bits, such as lips. It was for the time ingenious, tho it looked like shit even then.",0,0
JU21shbaVBo,"Wait, they call their archives The Morgue? Jeez, thanks for that mental picture Disney.",0,0
JU21shbaVBo,So basically if you've seen one Disney classic then you've seen them all.,0,0

JU21shbaVBo,11:09 I don't know why it's bothering so much that they put 1991 instead 1995 but I got so angry about it for no reason.,0,0

JU21shbaVBo,Next Week see how Don Bluth saved Disney Animation by being it's greatest rival.,1,0
JU21shbaVBo,That over used scream was also used in the 3 season of Netflix's voltron,2,0
JU21shbaVBo,"I thought they recycled animation to pray upon the nostalgia factor of the brain. When something feels familiar, you trust and like it easier. Same reason why many songs in Undertale are reworks of other songs within the same series.",3,1
JU21shbaVBo,"Turns out the practice of reusing animations was a cost costing innovation WAY ahead of its time and used FOR THE WRONG MEDIUM.  Shows an argument on how CGI is superior than hand drawn in a way, as CGI can be used over and over without little to no effort outside of customization.  Hand drawn, on the other hand, encourages constant innovation and starting from scratch, which can a counter argument.",1,0
JU21shbaVBo,"13:42 Well, the Wilhelm Scream is constantly added to movies just as a gag. It became a tradition to add at least one Wilhelm Scream per movie, pretty much.",2,0

F5Ma-1A-NS0,"I umpired fairly high-level baseball and softball for 30 years.  In the 2,500 games I worked, I saw perhaps ten spectators really get smacked hard by foul balls or wild throws.  They fell into just two demographics: children under the age of 12 and females.  In absolutely every case I witnessed, the person who was struck was inattentive and did not see the ball coming.  On the other hand, I've seen many fans who were properly paying attention to the game deftly protect their heads from hard-hit line drives by at least getting their arms in front of their faces.  I understand the child who was hurt in this clip was a three-year-old girl attending the game with her grandparents.  At the risk of sounding heartless, there is an inherent risk of bringing a small child to a baseball game in seats located so close to the field.  Common sense says a child so young will not be watching the game with any degree of interest.  It is best to sit in an upper deck when with a child.  It's safer and cheaper too.",0,0
F5Ma-1A-NS0,"Baseball has been around for 100 years. You know the risk if you buy a ticket. End of story. A child that small who cannot react to a foul ball should not be seated so close to the field where the ball will travel at a high velocity. It's sad, and I'm so happy to hear she's okay, but this overreacting bullshit needs to stop. You can get hit by a car crossing the street, would we put protective netting at every cross walk? You could slip and fall in the shower and die. Should we put netting on the shower floor? Life is patently dangerous. If you don't feel that you are aware of or are capable of dealing with the risk of a foul ball, either don't go to the game or sit in a section behind the netting. It's a reality of baseball. It's on the ticket.",0,0

F5Ma-1A-NS0,"For those of you arguing with the baseball purists about safety, I wouldn't bother. Most of them don't give a shit whether children are safe at the game. All they care about are their precious foul balls that they can catch and show off to their friends. There are ways to make it work, but they don't want to hear that. Never mind that most of them probably fell in love with the game when they were small children. They're all grown up now, so it's not their problem. All they care about are themselves, like most people on this planet these days. Not that it matters, but I am a baseball fan of 40 years, but I am also a father.

F5Ma-1A-NS0,"As a father of 3 children I couldn't imagine.  Terrible thing to have happen.  With that said it's baseball, and there are times where errand balls can get into the stands whether it be off the bat of a player or a overthrown ball or otherwise.  Part of the charm of a ball game is where kids get tossed foul balls from the players etc.  You put screens in that goes away, at least for that section.   \\n\\nThat's a terrible accident but I'm alittle torn on the idea of screens.  I can see the merit, but I'm not 100% for it either.  FYI, I grew up playing baseball and played competitively in various leagues into my early 20's.  I'm unfortunately aware of what can happen.  Part of the problem is also that many of these players now are hitting the ball quite a bit harder than the preceding players did on average.  Another issue is fans are distracted way too much.  I was watching a minor league game with my kids and a foul ball was ripped into my section.  A 15 year old girl took it right in the side of the head because she was talking to her friends and not watching the game.  The ball was hooking pretty hard from the side spin on the ball as well.  It was a wicked shot, and this was about 1/2 way down the outfield line on the 1st base side well past where they say many of the screens usually are in these parks.  Unfortunately they took her out on a stretcher.    \\n\\nSo not sure if screens are really the right answer.  Hockey is different.  Hockey the puck very seldom gets more and a few feet of elevation.  In baseball it's quiet common for a ball to be hit 100 or so feet up into the air if not more.  There is a much different 3rd dimension (altitude/height) that you have to account for in baseball.",0,0

hNsUtZmWgdg,One presumes this is a proof of concept. Unless you start somewhere you will never get to a practical end product. Yes bad weather will effect it's usibility but then those same weather conditions effect the drones capabilities too. As others have said a drone operator may not know he is being attacked tnough that will change to counter such weapons but then to take avoiding action will affect the drones own mission so the laser can still have an effective deterrent effect.

Hand drawn, on the other hand, encourages constant innovation and starting from scratch, which can a counter argument.",2,0

And I say it's tough because while it does offer important protection for fans sitting in those zones, it does take away a part of what makes being at the baseball games fun.  And now that I think of it... it mainly sucks for the people sitting near the front of those zones because ball girls, ball boys, or the players will no longer be able to toss foul balls to them or interact with them as much.  But as long as the nets aren't the size of field goal nets, fly balls can still be caught.  There would just be no longer an opportunity for fans to make impressive line drive catches.  I'd say I'm about 80-20% leaning in favor of netting.",0,0

hNsUtZmWgdg,One presumes this is a proof of concept. Unless you start somewhere you will never get to a practical end product. Yes bad weather will effect it's usibility but then those same weather conditions effect the drones capabilities too. As others have said a drone operator may not know he is being attacked tnough that will change to counter such weapons but then to take avoiding action will affect the drones own mission so the laser can still have an effective deterrent effect. Range would be the major question unanswered here but that is precisely why tests of this nature are important so as to refine and improve upon the concept.,0,0

DvbYf4eyGFI,"Has anyone else yet noticed that Taylor and Joseph Kahn stole from both Nicki Minaj (No Frauds) and Fergie with the throne, and from Fergie with the Look what you made me do line and a similar line to Now let's have a feast (locked me out and threw a feast) and is now trying to copyright Look what you made me do? (Somebody may be pissy that Kim K was in M.I.L.F $..)\\n\\nSo that's 3 artists whose art space has been stolen from in LWYMMD  noticed so far (Beyoncé was absolutely stolen from). This song and visual was completed way before LWYMMD and how convenient it was of Taylor to release her song with stolen material a month before Fergie's well known and much anticipated release date.\\n\\n I guess attempting to knock Fergie's 11 year album wait out of the way makes room for Taylor to outshine and be comeback of the year huh?..\\nSo many people compared Taylor's Look what you made me do vocal sound to Fergie (especially the 'do') and now we know why!! Don't even need to go indepth about copying with Ready for it because the attempt rap and overall sound is that obvious relating to Fergie. Fergie publicly acknowledged that Beyoncé inspired her in all areas concerning visual album so the least Taylor can do is acknowledge that Fergie inspired 2 of her songs (but then again, she can't acknowledge LWYMMD then she would be outing her thievery when she is supposed to be playing the badass victim now, so calculating). \\n\\nBeyoncé is a very inspirational person so I can't fault Fergie for having great taste towards who is worth being inspired by and atleast Fergie has the respect and decency to not take all the credit for the visual album idea (Fergie being the humble respectful person she is chances are spoke to Beyoncé prior to anything being done about a visual album). Taylor would sooner take all credit for other people's material/inspiration.\\n\\nTaylor also knocked off No Frauds by Nicki Minaj, Drake and Lil Bow Wow with the opening sequence with throne, snakes and the room set up with Chandeliers, it's evident in the first 10 seconds. Nicki did it first.\\n\\nFergie is friends with Nick Minaj and Nicki would have approved the throne being used.\\n\\nIf anyone needs more proof from Taylor knocking Fergie off, from 1:35 to 1:38 in this clip Taylor mimicked the the gun hand movement in LWYMMD when she was in the bathtub of diamonds and dollar note. Again, Fergie made this video clip first.\\n\\nFergie, you're a vocal true original so just keep on slaying it!! ❤",2,0

F5Ma-1A-NS0,"My thoughts are simple: Frazier *DIDN'T* hit that ball at her. Having spoke with professional baseball players over the past 10 years (admittedly, they were minor leaguers, but still), I *CONSISTENTLY* got the answer that they get just as scared when this happens to fans, and that they hope this never happens. Now, moving on to the comment at the beginning of this video about Are fans safe at a ballpark? No, we aren't. Plain and simple. But you also aren't safe at a hockey game, or a football game, or any sporting event. *BUT*, this is such a rare event, that when it *DOES* happen, everyone gets on it. Personally, I think that extending the nets is a good idea, *BECAUSE* of stuff like this. However, I think that it should be easy to see through, so that, y'know, you can watch the game.",0,0

F5Ma-1A-NS0,How is its the family's responsibility to find a safe seat to sit? really are they that stupid?  You pay to watch a game so you should be safe to sit anywhere in that Stadium. Yes I think they should put safety nets around the stadium. But if there are fans that don't want a netting around were they sit then they should do a section were there is no net and if they get hurt by a ball then it's there own fault for sitting were there is no net. It's the owners of the stadium to make sure all there spectators are safe. And it's definitely not the family's falter that that child got hit.,0,0

hNsUtZmWgdg,One presumes this is a proof of concept. Unless you start somewhere you will never get to a practical end product. Yes bad weather will effect it's usibility but then those same weather conditions effect the drones capabilities too. As others have said a drone operator may not know he is being attacked tnough that will change to counter such weapons but then to take avoiding action will affect the drones own mission so the laser can still have an effective deterrent effect. Range would be the major question unanswered here but that is precisely why tests of this nature are important so as to refine and improve upon the concept.,0,0

Because the same argument you used for the glass fibre infrastructure is applicable to our main net provider Telekom. They first built 4G at the most profitable metropole regions. That's it. The cables with especially glass fibre is so rare in germany. If you can load a steam game in under an hour you are very lucky and you cross this day in your calendar.

We had to depend on our cell phones and hotspotting to be connected to the world which was very hard when the cell phone companies had Data caps on their Internet, and even now with their unlimited plans they throttle or Internet speeds on the phones like crazy, because we go over the data caps too fast. Having good Internet in this day and age is so important it would allow me to run my YouTube channel much more affectively than I do now. So thank you vox for bringing this to peoples attention.

These lives matter in direct relation to  how much political capitol and media buzz they generate. The 11 people dead in Chicago this weekend generate zero so nobody cares.

However the biggest blame is the entire system of Division I College  Football (or whatever it's called now). You have to run up the score in blowout games just to have a shot to get a post season bowl bid or the more important berth in the Final 4 of the College Football Playoff. After a certain margin of score, they should be a cap in the college football standings period. Make it clear I am not calling for the mercy rule that in little league baseball.

F5Ma-1A-NS0,"The main thing people need to understand is that at one time hockey didn't have protective netting, until a 10 year old girl was hit by the puck, and killed. It's bound to happen, and it's almost a matter of time. If I was the teams I would most definitely install protective netting, but then again as I've learned the USA only changes once they see what can actually happen with their own two eyes",0,0
F5Ma-1A-NS0,She better have got that damn foul ball. Its a shame but when i was younger and went to ball games whoever i was with always made sure to remind me to pay attention and put my glove up in a situation like this. Too bad it was such a small child but you have to be careful on the foul line.,0,0
F5Ma-1A-NS0,It's stupid that baseball has been a long known sport and they are surprised that a fan got hit by a baseball that's dumb,0,0
F5Ma-1A-NS0,The chances of getting hit by a ball is slim. It's part of the game though. No need to add more netting in my opinion,0,0

F5Ma-1A-NS0,if the netting saves even one life it's worth the trouble and cost.,0,0
F5Ma-1A-NS0,"People in the stands who never played baseball aren't too alert to where the ball is at all times, but even if this sweet little girl had seen the ball coming she'd have been powerless to avoid it unless she had the presence of mind to duck down quick. Most adults are also unable to protect themselves because of inattention and taking their eye off the ball.  It's not a movie folks. \\n\\nFans in the stands are eating/drinking/talking, and don't watch the ball all the time, so they are vulnerable.  If you've played and are in the stands you already know what can happen if you're hit by the ball and try to stay alert.  Children should not be in the lowest level of the stands, OR there should be netting high enough to protect the ENTIRE ground level stands as far as 3rd base.\\n\\nUnfortunately, baseball is sold as 'family entertainment', and park owners have avoided the reality of people getting hurt over the years as pitchers threw faster, and hitters use that incoming energy to rocket the ball at over 100 mph off the bat.  If I think I'll be yakking at a game, I sit in the roof stands or behind home plate.  But if I had a baby there I'd be watching and protecting.",0,0

F5Ma-1A-NS0,"My thoughts are simple: Frazier *DIDN'T* hit that ball at her. Having spoke with professional baseball players over the past 10 years (admittedly, they were minor leaguers, but still), I *CONSISTENTLY* got the answer that they get just as scared when this happens to fans, and that they hope this never happens. Now, moving on to the comment at the beginning of this video about Are fans safe at a ballpark? No, we aren't. Plain and simple. But you also aren't safe at a hockey game, or a football game, or any sporting event. *BUT*, this is such a rare event, that when it *DOES* happen, everyone gets on it. Personally, I think that extending the nets is a good idea, *BECAUSE* of stuff like this. However, I think that it should be easy to see through, so that, y'know, you can watch the game.",0,0

F5Ma-1A-NS0,What makes no sense is why they have nets behind the catcher when a ball is going like 90 but on the sides they don't when a ball going off the bat can be like 100-110 I agree it's rare but even for the 3 or 4 people who get hurt are still people getting hurt,0,0

F5Ma-1A-NS0,"agree about extending the netting but I disagree also. fans need to be attentive at this games. real fans are. they watch every pitch and every swing and can react to foul balls and bats. but so many people go that don't pay attention to the sport so what's the point of going then? fans crave the ball hit in the seats so they can go home with a souvenir.

F5Ma-1A-NS0,Poor kid had to go to a baseball game and she was hit? Two for one.,0,0
F5Ma-1A-NS0,it is the parents fault. Why would you position your child at such dangerous seats such as the 3rd or the 1st baseline?

F5Ma-1A-NS0,How is its the family's responsibility to find a safe seat to sit? really are they that stupid?  You pay to watch a game so you should be safe to sit anywhere in that Stadium. Yes I think they should put safety nets around the stadium. But if there are fans that don't want a netting around were they sit then they should do a section were there is no net and if they get hurt by a ball then it's there own fault for sitting were there is no net. It's the owners of the stadium to make sure all there spectators are safe. And it's definitely not the family's falter that that child got hit.,0,0
F5Ma-1A-NS0,Also Fans seating in the 3rd and 1st base sections have to pay more attention to the ballgame because they're more prone on getting hit by foul balls.,0,0
F5Ma-1A-NS0,"it is the parents responsibility, There are other seating areas that you can take your child to watch a game. I used to coach baseball and when the ball is hit in that side of the field at that level it can be going over 150 miles an hour which would kill an adult let alone a child. Your child that young will enjoy the game just as much sitting in the upper level.",1,0

n54-eEvoMpg,"Vox, if you're going to do a story about internet in rural areas you need to mention the High Cost Program, a support mechanism of the Universal Service Fund (USF).  The high cost program is a $4.2 Billion fund that subsidizes Local Exchange Carriers (LECs) for providing telecommunication services in rural and high cost areas.  This is how people in the areas in this segment get their broadband services.  This is also the program, managed by the FCC, that is working to cut the broadband gap.  People need to be informed of this if they want to change the current status of broadband build-out in this country.",1,0

n54-eEvoMpg,"Although I agree with the sentiment of the message, it leaves off several details that are of extreme importance.\\n\\nFirst, Satellite Internet at Broadband Speeds is available to essentially all Americans today from multiple providers.  It is not a great tool for gaming but does meet the Broadband Requirement.  Thus, the first mistake is that the map shown is, in fact, a wireline map.  It does not include any form of wireless - including Satellite.\\n\\nSecond, there is an entire part of the story left off of the REA story.  That of the RUS - Rural US Telephone service.  Many of those same communities had started telephone service and under the REA the RUS was formed to help subsidize rural phone service.  There are around 1,100 local incumbent telephone companies in the US.  The big names (Verizon, AT&T, Frontier, Centurylink, Fairpoint) you probably have heard of.  But there are plenty of companies like TDS or East Otter Tail Telephone, or Copper Mountain Telephone in the US.\\n\\nThese small companies tend to have very good networks because they are subsidized by all of us.  If you see a charge for USF (Universal Service Fund), that is where that money goes to the tune of several $B per year.  Many of these companies are Co-Ops and are owned by the local town.  The biggest problem areas are rural properties of the large companies as they do not receive these subsidies.  They base their builds around their Return on Investment (ROI) and Rural Broadband falls behind Data Centers, Mobile Networking, Enterprise Fiber Optic Networks all the time.  They will simply never be built based on their value.\\n\\nThird, Wireless Internet (WISPs) exist and are good in some areas.  We are struggling with spectrum and line of sight issues and it is difficult get permits to build towers.  It can be a solution a bit, but most of the residential WISP connections that exist today do not meet the 25/3 definition of broadband.  It is not likely this is going to change soon.\\n\\nFinally, the solution hinted at existed in the Phone World that came about as part of the Telecom Act of 1934.  POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) was made a Universal Service.  That means that if you build a house, the telephone company must bring you a phone line.  Not might, not should, but must by law.  I worked on equipment that supported a cabin that had a 100 mile distance to the CO that served it.  That line was not cost effective, but that is why the subsidies exist (and are under the gun to be eliminated).  If we want Universal Broadband, then we need to legislate Universal Broadband.  It is the only way.",0,0

The French have offered it to most parts of the world from USA south (I'm Canadian and I know it's not available here). The money would be much better spent this way, with the use of relay towers on the ground. It seems as if this plan is just a mafia move to give money to the current powerful landline companies, by substidizing them to get more customers. Another alternative is an upgrade from 4g to 5g with cellphone companies. 5g has existed for many years but has yet to go mainstream. Upgrading would be way cheaper and faster the ground wires.... the only benifit of the ground wires is that it will employ labour workers for awhile, which perhaps part of his job agenda.",0,0

In the face of that, who cares about  five times as often ???\\n\\nStep two would be to cross-reference the wealthy with the poor, and consider how many more times the poor are shot by police than are the wealthy.\\n\\nThis is a society which can't even achieve balance in those areas, which are far, FAR more statistically significant than is anything related to African Americans or any other so-called racial minority.\\n\\nBut the problem is, you didn't bother to educate 'everyone' (including Costas) enough so that they can understand the statistics which are habitually in front of their eyes for all to see.\\n\\nCostas is only here as a service to the NFL... and as such, he's the last guy who should be reporting on near universal response to the story.

It was Kaepernick  along with those other pampered, ignorant millionaire athletes who have little understanding of history or the constitution who tainted a traditionally sacred moment with politics. Trump is calling them on the carpet for THEIR ACTIONS.   The anthem SHOULD NOT be a racial issue.  It should be a unifying and sacred moment for every American and its wrong for any person to use that national, public forum to exercise their First Amendment privilege for personal issues.  That's what the President is pursuing--bringing us together as one under a sacred symbol.  Why is that so hard for the liberal left to perceive? To throw the race card, once again, into the dialogue, just to take a cheap shot at the President just shows a lack of character and integrity.   Look at what Americans are saying--see it in your slumping ratings and see it in the lack of ticket sales.  People don't burn their favorite team's symbols for nothing.  We're sick of the denigration of our country by our own citizens and main stream media.  We love this country and we're standing up for it.  Bob, why don't  you talk about how the NFL can't even follow its OWN rules regarding the national anthem instead of ripping on the President.

Forty-one percent (41%) of pro football players have college degrees.  According to Forbes, only 40% of ALL adult Americans (black, white, brown, male, female, all) have college degrees, so the league is doing better than our general pop.  Some non-football players with college degrees aren't particularly well-spoken either.  To generalize and call an entire group, team, race, religion, nationality morons is inappropriate.

Once you become born again, the Holy Spirit gives you grace because of your faith in Jesus Christ.  This grace allows you to overcome temptation because Jesus was able to overcome the world.  Overcoming temptation gets you to a state of repentance.  The process of repenting takes your whole life time, for nobody ever gets to a point of being sinless for we are fallen sinful beings.

OlIeFVVXRpc,"They make it sound like they are supposed to be standing to the confederate flag. It's the stars and stripes that are a symbol of freedom and civil rights! The United States was the first country to abolish slavery, so naturally we would have social issues are to be expected, especially when the no one listened to Booker T. Washington when he warned that too much government intervention and protests would create white resentment. Instead he believed that black people should win over the white people by there good works. Things like this NFL protest are counterproductive to civil rights, always have been. Can we please just find another way to protest civil rights then this? The NFL rule book states that players should stand, if they don't follow the rules should there not be consequences? Everyone has a right to do what they want but at the same time there are consequences to our choices. Our flag is NOT a symbol of white supremacy, it's the symbol of our country and constitution, something that we all need to respect and defend....if we don't...then there will be noone willing to defend it anymore. Should we do away with the selected service too? Makes you wonder if thats the plan of our enemies all along.....",0,0

However the biggest blame is the entire system of Division I College  Football (or whatever it's called now). You have to run up the score in blowout games just to have a shot to get a post season bowl bid or the more important berth in the Final 4 of the College Football Playoff. After a certain margin of score, they should be a cap in the college football standings period. Make it clear I am not calling for the mercy rule that in little league baseball.

JU21shbaVBo,"Actually, CG cartoons do reuse animation (although I believe this is much more common in gaming). The animation isn't in the model itself -it's a file on it's own. You can apply the movements of one character to another if their models are similar enough. Take a closer look next time you play a game or watch a lower budget animated movie -you may notice a bunch of different enemies have the same walk or that all the characters dancing on screen dance with uncanny precision.",0,0
JU21shbaVBo,"It's not excusable to me. For a tv show that has a freaking deadline and is on a tiny budget, okay. And to justify it with the fast food animation of Hanna Barbara is just sad. If can provide me with non-Disney feature examples than okay, but if not then I say shame on you Disney!",0,0
JU21shbaVBo,"I think it would be kind of a pain to redraw scenes, and wouldn't be lazy even if they directly copied.  Copying animation isn't like copying a fashion style, after all.

I've certainly become more aware of it as I've gotten older.\\n\\nThe most egregious use of recycled animation for me had to be Gundam SEED and Gundam SEED Destiny.  They began to feel like clip shows and in Destiny I actually started feeling ill after seeing the same animation used for the 20th time.

Sure, photo shop/paint shop pro and CGI movies have their place in style - but all of the traditional/hand crafted arts, are ever more adored and become ever more admired; because of the opposite growing trends.

j8i18Wiaq7Q,لن اكلم المشائخ فقد سقطت بالنسبة لي مصداقيتهم في هذا الحدث وانا حر في ذلك لكن ابكون متحضر واسأل مجلس الشورى اين عقولكم  وخططكم يامتنورين  السؤال هنا  .. ماهو الهدف من السماح للنساء بالقيادة ؟. أليس لقضاء حاجاتهن والتخلص من السائق الأجنبي .. طيب ممتاز .. لماذا لم يسمح بجلب سائقات للنساء وافضل ان تكون افريقية سمراء ومعروف المغزى من ذلك  وشرط القبول ان تكون حاصلة على شهادة في الدفاع عن النفس لتكون ند لضعاف النفوس وبعد ذلك يعطى هذا القرار وقته ومن ثم ترفع التوصيات بنجاحه من عدمه .\nسبحان الله .. ربنا يقول ..  وقرن في بيوتكن .. والبعض يرقص فرحا بالسماح لخروج نسائهم لوحدهن  .. النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم لم يحث النساء للخروج الى للمسجد  وانتم تفرحون بهذا القرار  لتخرج كيف تشاء .. وبعدين انت يامن تقول النساء في وقت النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم  كانت تركب الناقة .. هذا ماتردده انت وامثالك بدون وعي .. نعم النساء ركبن الناقة والجمل لكن كانت النساء تقودها حول الحمى يعني بالقرب من سكنها ولاتسافر او تخرج بعيد عن موطن إقامتها لوحدها وهذا كان حتى قبل الاسلام .. في زمن الجاهلية كانت النساء تركبن الدواب ويسرن بها حول الحمى كما ذكرت  وكان الرجال حينها لهم من النخوة والعزة والغيرة  على ان يعتدون على اي امرأة حتى وإن كانت من اهل العدو وفي هذا قصص عديدة يفتخر و يتفاخر بها اهل جزيرة العرب اهل المروءة والشرف اقراء عن قصة اسماء بنت ابي بكر عندما صفعها ابوجهل بعد ان سأل عن والدها وقال اين اباك بعد ان هاجر مع النبي او إقراء عن زينب ابنته النبي صلى الله عليه وسلم عندما ارادت ان تلحق بأبيها للمدينة وقطع عليها الطريق صناديد قريش ماذا قالت سمية ابنة ابي خلف زوجة ابو سفيان وهي التي للتو قتل ابيها واثنين من اخوتها وعمها لم تقل انتقموا ايها الرجال لأهلي وإنما قالت امعركة مع أنثى؟ . كنتم في بدر وهزمتوا اتريدون انتصاركم على انثى ويحكم .. وصرخة بهم ابتعدوا عنها ثم دنت منها وقالت الك حاجة يا ابنة عم كانت شيم العرب في النساء والرجال تانف ان يقترب الرجال من النساء اما في عصر المدنية ماتت تلك القيم وأصبح الشائع قلة العقل والسفه الا من رحم ربي( وهم قله للأسف). ارجع لسؤالي لماذا سمح للمرأة القيادة ؟ ان كان عندكم جواب غير الذي ذكرت ووضعت له حل ولو جزئي ننتظر الرد  منكم او من المشاركين .\nنسأل الله السلامة.,0,0

rrZk9sSgRyQ,"Technically okay, but not really good in the writing. Plotholes that two Replicants in a hijacked tanker truck could drive through.  \\n\\n  Replicants were already banned for use on Earth. They could only be manufactured and were then confined to the manufacturer's premises - or delivery destination. \\n\\nThat Nuke was way too low to make an effective EMP, they need to be detonated fully outside of the atmosphere for the X-ray radiation to induce pair-scattering and loose electrons. \\n\\nThat data backups of strategic importance are confined to one facility is preposterous.  That doesn't happen even in today's world.  The Insurance underwriters won't let that happen.   \\n\\nNice security response.   I worked at a notable chemical manufacturer's facility in the early 90s.     The security there had their own Cadillac V100 armored car and M-16s, shotguns, S&W 76 subguns and Remington 700s.    I can't imagine in some dystopian future (with basically organic terminators running around willy-nilly)  at a facility of national importance,  that the front gate security would come out with pistols pyew pyew.      \\n\\nThe city architecture scenes were super nice though.",0,0

Plotholes that two Replicants in a hijacked tanker truck could drive through.  \\n\\n  Replicants were already banned for use on Earth. They could only be manufactured and were then confined to the manufacturer's premises - or delivery destination. \\n\\nThat Nuke was way too low to make an effective EMP, they need to be detonated fully outside of the atmosphere for the X-ray radiation to induce pair-scattering and loose electrons. \\n\\nThat data backups of strategic importance are confined to one facility is preposterous.  That doesn't happen even in today's world.  The Insurance underwriters won't let that happen.   \\n\\nNice security response.   I worked at a notable chemical manufacturer's facility in the early 90s.     The security there had their own Cadillac V100 armored car and M-16s, shotguns, S&W 76 subguns and Remington 700s.    I can't imagine in some dystopian future (with basically organic terminators running around willy-nilly)  at a facility of national importance,  that the front gate security would come out with pistols pyew pyew.      \\n\\nThe city architecture scenes were super nice though.",0,0

I've gone to a couple of kitchenware shops that sell some decorating stuff like food colours and sprinkles but they are the same ones I find in the supermarket. your lustre dust also seems to form a really opaque solution when you mix it with the vodka and doesn't clump up so I've been look but can't find any that doesn't clump! :(,0,0

txvKrTplOVs,Kumail is AWESOME!\n\nI met him  at a show in Atlanta a few years ago. What happened next I couldn't make up if I tried. I GOT PULLED UP ON STAGE TO PERFORM STAND UP COMEDY!!!!\n\nI was taking professional lessons on how to be a stand up comic. We had homework as you would in any class. Go see someone live or you cannot perform. The rules could not be more clear. About two weeks before I was supposed to perform I decided to go and see Thomas Middleditch and Kumail Nanjiani as my watch a comedian perform live homework.\n\nThey were awesome and after the show they had a little Q and A. I asked for advice on how to perform stand up comedy. They pulled me up on stage in front of THEIR sold out show of 500 people. I got pity laughs there is really no other way of saying it. The material I performed wasn't finished but some people found it genuinely funny. I got to talk to Kumail and Thomas for a few minutes afterwards.\n\nTwo weeks later I performed on the exact same stage they had when I was supposed to. And I killed it. The only reason I did was because I performed on stage with them first. That was absolutely terrifying to get pulled up on stage at their show but because I did performing my own set a few weeks later wasn't difficult at all. I really got into comedy and genuinely want to pursue the profession. Then I got sick for 2 years within a few weeks after that one big performance. It's been well over a year now that I keep saying I will get back on stage this month I haven't yet though ><,0,0

Chiesa is the only real legit 155er that he’s beat, even then Chiesa isn’t a top contender either. IMO they should have given him at least one more fight before he was taking on the top of the division. He’s not yet on the same level as guys like Conor, Tony, or Khabib. I’d like to see him fight Gaethje. I feel like that would be a good test to see where he’s at. Otherwise, Mighty Mouse has cleaned out 125 and there is no more competition for him there.

Chiesa is the only real legit 155er that he’s beat, even then Chiesa isn’t a top contender either. IMO they should have given him at least one more fight before he was taking on the top of the division. He’s not yet on the same level as guys like Conor, Tony, or Khabib. I’d like to see him fight Gaethje. I feel like that would be a good test to see where he’s at. Otherwise, Mighty Mouse has cleaned out 125 and there is no more competition for him there. I really want to see Tony vs Conor. Werdum might be getting the rematch against Stepe. Bisping vs GSP will be interesting",0,0

yG-yfbDscbo,"I'd love to know your thoughts on something I picked up on. In the trailer, Luke said that this power did not scare him then but it does now. Now as you know, one of the rules of being a Jedi is your not allowed to feel fear for it is a path that leads to the Dark Side. Do you think Luke showing this flaw might say something about where he stands as a Jedi in this movie? Or could the theories all be true and Luke really has turned to the Dark Side? Or am I just looking to much into this?",0,0

yG-yfbDscbo,"The biggest gripe I have with this new trilogy is, where the fuck did the first order get all that stuff? I mean you'd think after toppling the last empire the new rebuplic would never let that happen again. Like it's basically if after losing WW2 the nazi party rose up all of a sudden with a huge army 20 years later and started WW3? Like where would they get the resources to do that. The nazi party was completely destroyed and Germany was split among the allies with all remaining nazis hunted down and killed. The same should have applied in Star Wars universe but somehow not. It's kinda lazy writing to just say, hey we're back without any explanation. Like how did the republic not notice them amassing a huge army and planet sized weapon?? It's just not convincing that the first order could exist so it makes the rest of the movies kinda dumb",0,0
yG-yfbDscbo,the movie is going to end with Ray joining Kilo Ren and be a huge cliff hanger for the next movie.  Will she turn to the darkside? Maybe.  Or maybe she's tricking Kilo.  Either way thats how it will end,0,0
yG-yfbDscbo,"Here's what I think:\\nEpisode 7: Rey: Light Kylo: Dark\\nEpisode 8: Rey: Dark Kylo: Light\\nEpisode 9 (At the very end): Rey: Gray Kylo: Gray\\nThis would be a great theme to wrap up Star Wars. Sometimes, everything isn't all black and white. There's faults in the Jedi's philosophy and there's faults in the Sith's philosophy.",0,0
yG-yfbDscbo,"The scene at the end is definitely cobbled together from other things. Rey's wearing her Resistance gear (which she has at the end of 7/beginning of 8 and will likely quickly change out of into her Jedi Training gear) and looks like she's sitting down, and the lighting is very yellow and looks like she might be talking to Luke next to a campfire. Meanwhile Kylo's lighting is very orange and there's flames falling out of the sky all around him. I think this is TLJ's red herring. Also Kylo says nothing in that scene, he just extends a hand, and for all we know it might be cut right before he does the Neo come at me hand gesture.",0,0

The Absoulte. The Undivided Power.  The Balance. Again, with the theory Star Wars has some ties to Buddishm and Taoism, It could be possible. Ren Is the Dark Side, But, in his dark side, there a part of Light in him,  Rey is the Light, but, also, she has a dark side to her. Both Kylo and Rey are equal in power and strength. But, instead of fighting each other, how about they start to equalize everything. They harness the  Absolute Force. They can destroy everything in their path, transforming themselves into  should i say gods ? \\nThey are part of the bigger scheme of things. The ultimate annihilation of the universe. Now, nor jedi or first order can beat them. The major plot twist ? Luke has forshadowed this ... he knows what's coming. And by the way, guess what ?\\nIn my wild card theory, they are brother and sister. Hear me out: Luke after the return of the jedi. decides to live a celebatary life, learning about the force and everything in it. Leia and Han have Kylo, but, what if, Leia had given birth to Rey and Kylo ?\\nKylo is trained by luke and rey stays with her mom.  Now, Leia, senses that her daughter is more developed than she thinks.\\nThis might cause a problem. Therefore, she delivers her to another family and for her nor to dwell in her ability ...\\nShe focus her efford on Kylo and hopes to bring them together ... Then, well ... The plans don't go as they were supposed to ...\\nIf there's any flaws on this theory, i understand. I don't know the full official and unofficial canon. It's just conjecture.\\nBut feel free to point out the holes ....",0,0

yG-yfbDscbo,"This will be a slight spoiler for some people: My thoughts on this preview are mainly that this movie is going to be awesome. First off, we have Kylo in a station at the beginning. I belive the station is working on what looks like dozens of new war machines for the First Order. Then it shows Kylo Ren walking across a cave-like area with over a dozen flametroopers. Next, Ren is seen in a metallic-glassy looking room with two Imperial/First Order guards. I'm guessing he is receiving his new lightsaber. The next series of images show Rey and Luke training. Luke then sees how powerful Rey has become, and wants no part of it. Then we finally see Kylo Ren flying in combat. About to destroy his mother, after his father in Force Awakens, he hesitates, trying to decide between good and evil. After that, the Millennium Falcon zooms through what looks like the same cave seen earlier, this time in a wider range. The planet_cave they're on must be large... large enough for a small ship battle! After we see Chewy, and his new friend, we see a series of Poe Dameron's images. Mostly, he is in a space environment, like always! Finally, for my favorite part of the trailer... Captain Phasma and Finn fighting one on one, Finn holding a similar weapon found in the last movie. I am a huge fan of Phasma, and clearly, if you know Phasma's origin, would beat Finn within a matter of seconds. Later, we go back to Luke and Rey. I'm guessing that when Luke is talking in the background, he is arguing with Leia on how to let Rey go on. Then a huge battle scene appears with improved AT-AT's and a ship similar to Ren's against a small army of Resistance ships. Next, we finally get a glance at Snoke, (not as a huge hologram), using the force against Rey, trying her best to resist his actions. Lastly, Rey and Ren are together (although I know some people disagree and think those are two completely different scenes) and Rey asks for someone to show her the way, probably through the force and battle. And that is going to be the end of my summary, thanks for reading! Bye!!!",0,0

yG-yfbDscbo,"See thats exactly what I got from the trailer, but my father who is way to into the lore of Star Wars does not think Luke would turn Rey down, but will know what she is... which my father believes is a Grey.\\n\\nGrey are more powerful and more in tuned with the force then Jedi and can work with both the light and dark sides of the force without giving into the sides. Which would be a very bad thing to turn her away and risk her becoming dark like Ben did. Also believing that Ben is a Grey cuz he used light forces as well as dark in the force awakens and him being luke's first encounter of such power. \\n\\nBen will be unable to kill Leia because in the original lore her loved his mother more than anything. the order will kill leia possibly even killing luke and rey and ben will team up against the order and snoke. \\n\\nLuke will die the last Jedi and Rey and Ben will be the return of the ancient Greys. Thats my father's theory.",0,0

yG-yfbDscbo,"I think Luke gets scared of her ability cause he’s seen it with Kylo and what happened when Snoke turned him to the dark side.  She tells him about Kylo and someone needs to destroy him.  He trains her up to a certain point and gets scared and tells her the Jedi should end. She gets frustrated, leaves, and finds someone as strong in the force as she is in Kylo.  Kylo says she needs to be taught the ways of the force by Snoke & the dark side is the right side to be on.  She will be so much more powerful if she follows him & Snoke.  I think Kylo is telling Rey that she needs to kill the past being Luke to fulfill her destiny!! And we leave on a cliff hanger with Kylo & Snoke trying to seduce her to the dark side!! And then Luke comes to the rescue in the next one after Kylo killing Leia!!!",0,1

yG-yfbDscbo,"The Last Jedi: This is not going to go the way you think! \\nTag line, boom, owned it. \\nI love the thought of Rey and Kylo both saying, 'alright, screw you guys, we'll do it our way and figure it out together.' For some reason, I get the feeling that Kylo's Let the past die bit is either him talking to himself, or to Snoke, and processing what he was told to do with Han, because that did not work out the way he was told it would by Snoke. Kylo got weaker, not stronger. Or, maybe he is saying this to Rey as advice, urging her on in some way in her bad-assery (like if Snoke is the one who dropped Rey off on Jakku, and maybe Kylo is saying kill it to her re Snoke during the torture scene, because he feels betrayed by him and has sympathy for her. SO many questions! Also, re our boy Luke, maybe he is talking to a force ghost when he explains how afraid he is. Well played holding off showing them and Luke trashing some fools until we can see it on the big screen. Trailer gets better every time I watch it.",0,1

Why can't people take a detour and try something different? Whether it's a different sound, visual or experience. There are always going to be some who stay in the past and are unhappy when artists change and experiment. And so what if St.Vincent wants to try performing on her own or offer a different experience? I'm glad when artists don't stay stuck just to please. Annie is trying something bolder, brighter and clearer. Observing different things now. Still staying true to her guitar.

But seeing her perform Los Ageless on Colbert....and now hearing THIS, I'm now super thrilled for this new album. I mean, she never ever disappoints....and this new albums is looking to be even _more_ eclectic and surreal _and catchy_ than past stuff, and that's saying something. Annie is such a force of nature...what I especially love about her is that she's not only absurdly creative and smart...but she's a bit nuts, maybe more than a bit. That's a very crucial ingredient to making a truly interesting artist, or even just an interesting human being.\\n\\nPeople like Bjork or Bowie or Prince or Jack White or Michael Jackson....this list is long, although only representing a *_tiny_* fraction of humanity, those sort of artists are what I gravitate toward. People who are not only very talented and informed at songwriting....but who also have a few screws loose; artists who seem very self-confident and mentally sharp, but who also have a noticeable undercurrent of madness lurking beneath the surface. That's an important element of creative thinking and doing...and Annie has it in spades. She's very..._iconic_ to me...and I'm hugely inspired by Annie in making my own music and art.",0,0

Better they try different directions and styles than stay stagnant trying to please fans who just want the artist to do the same thing again and again. Why can't people take a detour and try something different? Whether it's a different sound, visual or experience. There are always going to be some who stay in the past and are unhappy when artists change and experiment. And so what if St.Vincent wants to try performing on her own or offer a different experience? I'm glad when artists don't stay stuck just to please. Annie is trying something bolder, brighter and clearer. Observing different things now. Still staying true to her guitar.

yG-yfbDscbo,"See thats exactly what I got from the trailer, but my father who is way to into the lore of Star Wars does not think Luke would turn Rey down, but will know what she is... which my father believes is a Grey.\\n\\nGrey are more powerful and more in tuned with the force then Jedi and can work with both the light and dark sides of the force without giving into the sides. Which would be a very bad thing to turn her away and risk her becoming dark like Ben did. Also believing that Ben is a Grey cuz he used light forces as well as dark in the force awakens and him being luke's first encounter of such power. \\n\\nBen will be unable to kill Leia because in the original lore her loved his mother more than anything. the order will kill leia possibly even killing luke and rey and ben will team up against the order and snoke. \\n\\nLuke will die the last Jedi and Rey and Ben will be the return of the ancient Greys. Thats my father's theory.",0,0

So she steals some books and ghosts. \\n\\nI'm guessing it'll be similar to how Luke left Yoda except for different reasons. I doubt we'll see much of Luke's power unless its in flashbacks.

yG-yfbDscbo,"I think Luke gets scared of her ability cause he’s seen it with Kylo and what happened when Snoke turned him to the dark side.  She tells him about Kylo and someone needs to destroy him.  He trains her up to a certain point and gets scared and tells her the Jedi should end. She gets frustrated, leaves, and finds someone as strong in the force as she is in Kylo.  Kylo says she needs to be taught the ways of the force by Snoke & the dark side is the right side to be on.  She will be so much more powerful if she follows him & Snoke.  I think Kylo is telling Rey that she needs to kill the past being Luke to fulfill her destiny!! And we leave on a cliff hanger with Kylo & Snoke trying to seduce her to the dark side!! And then Luke comes to the rescue in the next one after Kylo killing Leia!!!",0,1

For some reason, I get the feeling that Kylo's Let the past die bit is either him talking to himself, or to Snoke, and processing what he was told to do with Han, because that did not work out the way he was told it would by Snoke. Kylo got weaker, not stronger. Or, maybe he is saying this to Rey as advice, urging her on in some way in her bad-assery (like if Snoke is the one who dropped Rey off on Jakku, and maybe Kylo is saying kill it to her re Snoke during the torture scene, because he feels betrayed by him and has sympathy for her. SO many questions! Also, re our boy Luke, maybe he is talking to a force ghost when he explains how afraid he is. Well played holding off showing them and Luke trashing some fools until we can see it on the big screen. Trailer gets better every time I watch it.",0,1

cqpg9IJ0jbg,"Yeah Jody I love Revenge Of The Sith too. It did change how I looked at Star Wars. The Emperor and Obi Wan were the stars of that movie, especially Obi Wan. The score, the quotes, and the action were dope. But what really made me love it was Obi vs Anakin at the end, that fight was PURE EPIC for real. Obi's lines were epic you were supposed to be the chosen one it's over Anakin i have the high ground only a Sith deals in absolutes, i will do what I must BUCKETS!!!

Perfect! during the trailer and while Jody and the crew was talking was a bit irritating at times. Just my honest opinion.\\n\\n*2) Luke Dipped:* From what it seemed like to me, Luke was talking to Rey. He saw the power of her Force, similar to Kylo's, which is why he said that when he witnessed this raw strength the first time, he wasn't afraid, but that now he was.\\n\\n*3) Leia:* The only part of this trailer that came close to making me feel anything was seeing Carrie Fisher on that spacecraft and Kylo with his finger on the trigger. Out of all ways for General Leia to die, it's gotta be by this weak Kylo's hand? Not to mention her son, too - this nigga be offin' his pops and his mother. And even then, he doesn't come across as savage or menacing.",5,1

If kylo and snoke were both bad that's honestly very simple storytelling. If Rey and kylo were in a grey area that would really change the whole Star Wars universe.

cqpg9IJ0jbg,"Kylo won't push the trigger and shoot at his mother. Look closely at his facial expressions in that shot. The Force Awakens novel and script both said he immediately regretted killing Han. Snoke had convinced him that he had to kill Han to reach his potential, but he felt weakened instead. Plus the director of this movie said that Leia's story arc will be very satisfying. How would that be if her son kills her? Even though Kylo is speaking about killing the past during that shot, I think that's a later conversation Kylo is having with Rey.",0,0
cqpg9IJ0jbg,"I think Luke was talking about Kylo ren when he was talking about the raw power, he didn't fear/ respect it so kylo became a loose cannon, he probably could've trained him better. Now that he sees Rey, another person with a lot of power, he fears/respects it tremendously because of what kylo ren did (killed the other students and joined Snoke). He's going to want to be the best mentor possible to Rey, because he does not want another one of his students go down a path of violence.",0,0

Is Trump perfect? Of course not. Many conservatives paint him to be the best man ever. He isn't. But, I must admit, he's a hell of a lot better than I had originally expected him to be. I voted for him, but had my reservations. He's the most pro-life President we've seen, though it may be debated with Reagan.

ofzjzf_rhZc,"Shorting the COM is not a cheap circuit board design necessarily. The cheap boards will actually just have them shorted on a ground plane or something or to the battery like you have.. Its done disconnected  that way so you can have an isolated load. The relay might be switching something that is at a different voltage or even a different common mode entirely.\\n\\nSuppose instead of one battery, you had like a 5V line controlling the logic and a 24V battery or something, by isolating them you can use both without them shorting. On this board that has the 18V from your batteries shorted to the relay COM you do not have an option to use a seperate battery. \\n\\nSuppose also that you were not connecting a battery to the load, or it was an AC load.

So the scientists and specialists found that by replacing those healthy bacteria while the patient was in the hospital, they found that the patient had less nausea, they could eat what they wanted to eat, they had more energy, faster recovery, and generally felt better after getting chemo'.

But seeing her perform Los Ageless on Colbert....and now hearing THIS, I'm now super thrilled for this new album. I mean, she never ever disappoints....and this new albums is looking to be even _more_ eclectic and surreal _and catchy_ than past stuff, and that's saying something. Annie is such a force of nature...what I especially love about her is that she's not only absurdly creative and smart...but she's a bit nuts, maybe more than a bit. That's a very crucial ingredient to making a truly interesting artist, or even just an interesting human being.\\n\\nPeople like Bjork or Bowie or Prince or Jack White or Michael Jackson....this list is long, although only representing a *_tiny_* fraction of humanity, those sort of artists are what I gravitate toward. People who are not only very talented and informed at songwriting....but who also have a few screws loose; artists who seem very self-confident and mentally sharp, but who also have a noticeable undercurrent of madness lurking beneath the surface. That's an important element of creative thinking and doing...and Annie has it in spades. She's very..._iconic_ to me...and I'm hugely inspired by Annie in making my own music and art.",0,0

Better they try different directions and styles than stay stagnant trying to please fans who just want the artist to do the same thing again and again. Why can't people take a detour and try something different? Whether it's a different sound, visual or experience. There are always going to be some who stay in the past and are unhappy when artists change and experiment. And so what if St.Vincent wants to try performing on her own or offer a different experience? I'm glad when artists don't stay stuck just to please. Annie is trying something bolder, brighter and clearer. Observing different things now. Still staying true to her guitar. But I do understand sometimes people just don't dig something and that's fair enough. There's a beauty in difference of views and opinion.",1,0

She tells him about Kylo and someone needs to destroy him.  He trains her up to a certain point and gets scared and tells her the Jedi should end. She gets frustrated, leaves, and finds someone as strong in the force as she is in Kylo.  Kylo says she needs to be taught the ways of the force by Snoke & the dark side is the right side to be on.  She will be so much more powerful if she follows him & Snoke.  I think Kylo is telling Rey that she needs to kill the past being Luke to fulfill her destiny!! And we leave on a cliff hanger with Kylo & Snoke trying to seduce her to the dark side!! And then Luke comes to the rescue in the next one after Kylo killing Leia!!!",0,0

For some reason, I get the feeling that Kylo's Let the past die bit is either him talking to himself, or to Snoke, and processing what he was told to do with Han, because that did not work out the way he was told it would by Snoke. Kylo got weaker, not stronger. Or, maybe he is saying this to Rey as advice, urging her on in some way in her bad-assery (like if Snoke is the one who dropped Rey off on Jakku, and maybe Kylo is saying kill it to her re Snoke during the torture scene, because he feels betrayed by him and has sympathy for her. SO many questions! Also, re our boy Luke, maybe he is talking to a force ghost when he explains how afraid he is.

The score, the quotes, and the action were dope. But what really made me love it was Obi vs Anakin at the end, that fight was PURE EPIC for real. Obi's lines were epic you were supposed to be the chosen one it's over Anakin i have the high ground only a Sith deals in absolutes, i will do what I must BUCKETS!!! Love Ewan McGregor and that movie.",4,0
cqpg9IJ0jbg,"Three things from this video:\\n\\n*1) You Win! Perfect:* I'm glad that Jody's Corner got all them new family members joining, it's no secret I wanna see this channel grow to great heights, but hearing that You Win! Perfect! during the trailer and while Jody and the crew was talking was a bit irritating at times. Just my honest opinion.\\n\\n*2) Luke Dipped:* From what it seemed like to me, Luke was talking to Rey. He saw the power of her Force, similar to Kylo's, which is why he said that when he witnessed this raw strength the first time, he wasn't afraid, but that now he was.\\n\\n*3) Leia:* The only part of this trailer that came close to making me feel anything was seeing Carrie Fisher on that spacecraft and Kylo with his finger on the trigger. Out of all ways for General Leia to die, it's gotta be by this weak Kylo's hand? Not to mention her son, too - this nigga be offin' his pops and his mother. And even then, he doesn't come across as savage or menacing.",5,1

cqpg9IJ0jbg,"My theory is  we saw kylo struggling to kill his mom, I honestly don't think he will because they would not show it in the trailer. I honestly think kylo is going to go good or at least be in the middle. This trilogy already has a big bad guy and that's snoke. If kylo and snoke were both bad that's honestly very simple storytelling. If Rey and kylo were in a grey area that would really change the whole Star Wars universe. I don't want that right now, but if rian Johnson manages to convince me i will not mind it.",0,0

cqpg9IJ0jbg,"Kylo won't push the trigger and shoot at his mother. Look closely at his facial expressions in that shot. The Force Awakens novel and script both said he immediately regretted killing Han. Snoke had convinced him that he had to kill Han to reach his potential, but he felt weakened instead. Plus the director of this movie said that Leia's story arc will be very satisfying. How would that be if her son kills her? Even though Kylo is speaking about killing the past during that shot, I think that's a later conversation Kylo is having with Rey.",0,0
cqpg9IJ0jbg,"I think Luke was talking about Kylo ren when he was talking about the raw power, he didn't fear/ respect it so kylo became a loose cannon, he probably could've trained him better. Now that he sees Rey, another person with a lot of power, he fears/respects it tremendously because of what kylo ren did (killed the other students and joined Snoke). He's going to want to be the best mentor possible to Rey, because he does not want another one of his students go down a path of violence.",0,0

ofzjzf_rhZc,"I think it's possible you have misunderstood the way to wire up that board. Normally you don't have to connect anything from the PWR IN to the three relay connections. Your wiring of the relay connections is unusual and may be the root of your problem. So, one solenoid contact goes to battery ground, but the other goes just to N/O and NOT to N/C. When your signal reaches the unit, the contacts switch over and the solenoid gets power. You might want to try it",0,0
ofzjzf_rhZc,You should make a mini bike (taco bike),0,0
ofzjzf_rhZc,Relays for the most part will always need a common connection. Also you would wire using NO contact of the relay meaning no current flows to the valve under normal conditions. When you activate the relay (button) you close the circuit allowing current flow to the valve.,0,0

That's not a good circuit, electronics are in the same box as the hydraulic valve, without spacers and not only you messed up the relay NO/NC contacts, you didn't know why common needs to be connected. The reason is that this way, you can also use it to switch 230V mains if you want. Seems like a useless project, since the two 9V batteries likely won't last a week in NO configuration or even a day in NC configuration (those solenoid valves draw a lot of pixies and the relay box is just inefficient).",0,0

They said Chemo, kills cancer cells...and healthy cells, but it also kills all the good bacteria in our gut, colon, etc. Bacteria that actually keeps us healthy, that our body needs!. So the scientists and specialists found that by replacing those healthy bacteria while the patient was in the hospital, they found that the patient had less nausea, they could eat what they wanted to eat, they had more energy, faster recovery, and generally felt better after getting chemo'. You probably know what I'm talking about already. Well Wil, sending good vibes your way .Peace, Matt.",0,0

hwFx0ROBf7o,"The first song, New York...just didn't really do it for me. I love Annie for her insanely idiosyncratic angular approach to songwriting....and that song just didn't tickle my fancy. But seeing her perform Los Ageless on Colbert....and now hearing THIS, I'm now super thrilled for this new album. I mean, she never ever disappoints....and this new albums is looking to be even _more_ eclectic and surreal _and catchy_ than past stuff, and that's saying something. Annie is such a force of nature...what I especially love about her is that she's not only absurdly creative and smart...but she's a bit nuts, maybe more than a bit. That's a very crucial ingredient to making a truly interesting artist, or even just an interesting human being.\\n\\nPeople like Bjork or Bowie or Prince or Jack White or Michael Jackson....this list is long, although only representing a *_tiny_* fraction of humanity, those sort of artists are what I gravitate toward. People who are not only very talented and informed at songwriting....but who also have a few screws loose; artists who seem very self-confident and mentally sharp, but who also have a noticeable undercurrent of madness lurking beneath the surface. That's an important element of creative thinking and doing...and Annie has it in spades. She's very..._iconic_ to me...and I'm hugely inspired by Annie in making my own music and art.",0,0

Better they try different directions and styles than stay stagnant trying to please fans who just want the artist to do the same thing again and again. Why can't people take a detour and try something different? Whether it's a different sound, visual or experience. There are always going to be some who stay in the past and are unhappy when artists change and experiment. And so what if St.Vincent wants to try performing on her own or offer a different experience? I'm glad when artists don't stay stuck just to please. Annie is trying something bolder, brighter and clearer. Observing different things now. Still staying true to her guitar.

9gBixJFcSJg,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",0,0

That's not a good circuit, electronics are in the same box as the hydraulic valve, without spacers and not only you messed up the relay NO/NC contacts, you didn't know why common needs to be connected. The reason is that this way, you can also use it to switch 230V mains if you want. Seems like a useless project, since the two 9V batteries likely won't last a week in NO configuration or even a day in NC configuration (those solenoid valves draw a lot of pixies and the relay box is just inefficient).",0,0

ofzjzf_rhZc,"I think it's possible you have misunderstood the way to wire up that board. Normally you don't have to connect anything from the PWR IN to the three relay connections. Your wiring of the relay connections is unusual and may be the root of your problem. So, one solenoid contact goes to battery ground, but the other goes just to N/O and NOT to N/C. When your signal reaches the unit, the contacts switch over and the solenoid gets power. You might want to try it",0,0

They said Chemo, kills cancer cells...and healthy cells, but it also kills all the good bacteria in our gut, colon, etc. Bacteria that actually keeps us healthy, that our body needs!. So the scientists and specialists found that by replacing those healthy bacteria while the patient was in the hospital, they found that the patient had less nausea, they could eat what they wanted to eat, they had more energy, faster recovery, and generally felt better after getting chemo'. You probably know what I'm talking about already. Well Wil, sending good vibes your way .Peace, Matt.",0,0

Yall have the funniest little arguments but whem its ovet tell each other 'i love', you both make the craziest pranks on each other and you either get pissed or cry but in the end tell each other 'I love you' . yall can act totally ridiculous in public or not but never be embarrassed of each other. Yall both will do anything for each other amd it sets so much goals for people and its so inspiring.❤\\nYall just keep doing what yall are doing cause you both dont know how much you impact on yalls fans and set huge examples for love.

9gBixJFcSJg,"JP and Julia I am sure you guys have found this to be true but you cannot underestimate letting things sit for at least 24 hrs. Especially when it comes to commercial sauces. So many copy cat recipes out there get negative feedback because people make it, try it and then it doesn't taste exact because they haven't given the ingredients a chance to marry. I learned this over a sauce recipe from my fav Chicken finger spot in Louisiana, Raising Cains. Their sauce is amazing. So much so people sub out items from their combos for extra sauces. LoL",0,0

ofzjzf_rhZc,"I think it's possible you have misunderstood the way to wire up that board. Normally you don't have to connect anything from the PWR IN to the three relay connections. Your wiring of the relay connections is unusual and may be the root of your problem. So, one solenoid contact goes to battery ground, but the other goes just to N/O and NOT to N/C. When your signal reaches the unit, the contacts switch over and the solenoid gets power. You might want to try it",0,0
ofzjzf_rhZc,You should make a mini bike (taco bike),0,0
ofzjzf_rhZc,Relays for the most part will always need a common connection. Also you would wire using NO contact of the relay meaning no current flows to the valve under normal conditions. When you activate the relay (button) you close the circuit allowing current flow to the valve.,0,0

ofzjzf_rhZc,"This one is bad. That's not a good circuit, electronics are in the same box as the hydraulic valve, without spacers and not only you messed up the relay NO/NC contacts, you didn't know why common needs to be connected. The reason is that this way, you can also use it to switch 230V mains if you want. Seems like a useless project, since the two 9V batteries likely won't last a week in NO configuration or even a day in NC configuration (those solenoid valves draw a lot of pixies and the relay box is just inefficient).",0,0

9gBixJFcSJg,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",0,0

S5Esa9L4nvE,"Time travel is mathematically not possible.\\n\\nWhen a signal is sent from one location and received at another location, then as long as the signal is moving at the speed of light or slower, the mathematics of simultaneity in the theory of relativity show that all reference frames agree that the transmission-event happened before the reception-event. When the signal travels faster than light, it is received before it is sent, in all reference frames. The signal could be said to have moved backward in time. This hypothetical scenario is sometimes referred to as a tachyonic antitelephone.\\n\\nQuantum-mechanical phenomena such as quantum teleportation, the EPR paradox, or quantum entanglement might appear to create a mechanism that allows for faster-than-light (FTL) communication or time travel, and in fact some interpretations of quantum mechanics such as the Bohm interpretation presume that some information is being exchanged between particles instantaneously in order to maintain correlations between particles. This effect was referred to as spooky action at a distance by Einstein.\\n\\nNevertheless, the fact that causality is preserved in quantum mechanics is a rigorous result in modern quantum field theories, and therefore modern theories do not allow for time travel or FTL communication. In any specific instance where FTL has been claimed, more detailed analysis has proven that to get a signal, some form of classical communication must also be used. The no-communication theorem also gives a general proof that quantum entanglement cannot be used to transmit information faster than classical signals.",5,8

iv1C0pEdhOg,"So, from this, what I would like to see you guys try is a taste test with your noses plugged.  80% of ones sense of taste comes from their sense of smell. If you don't believe me, try it. Say, with a Dorito. Plug your nose, put it in your mouth and start chewing. During the chewing process, unplug your nose...and MAGIC! :D\\nI mention this, because, I would like Rhett to try that nasty blood with this process. I mean, I'm sure once he unplugged his nose he'd hate his life, but I want to see if he can handle it then (before the unplugging of the nose).\\n\\nPossible other things to do this with are obviously foods that you would normally not like (Link, I'm not sure tomato's count but you can try! I don't know if it's the smell of them that you don't like or the texture. To me it's texture.)\\nBut also try it with spicy things, to gauge the level of spice you taste with your nose plugged versus the rush of heat when unplugged.\\n\\nOf course, salty, sweet. I can't really go into exact foods because I leave that all up to you! But that nasty blood is one I'd like for Rhett...probably at the end like he did in this video. If you do consider this in advance, Rhett, I promise I don't hate you. That's not why I'm suggesting it.

9gBixJFcSJg,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",0,0

Q7o163QU8CE,"I have a book recommendation for you! It's probably the most amazing book I have read this year, apart from On The Other Side of course. It's called 'The Night Circus' and it was written by Erin Morgenstern. It is truly amazing and each of the characters are gorgeous and profound. Here's the blurb and I hope that one day you can find and enjoy this book as I have.\\nIn 1886 a mysterious travelling circus becomes an international sensation. Open only at night, constructed entirely in black and white, the Cirque des Rêves delights all who wander its circular paths and warm themselves at its bonfire. There are contortionists, performing cats, carousels and illusionists - all the trappings of an ordinary circus. But this is no conventional spectacle. Some tents contain clouds, some ice. The circus seems almost to cast a spell over its aficionados, who call themselves the rêveurs - the dreamers. And who is the sinister man in the grey suit who watches over it all? Behind the scenes a dangerous game is being played out by two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who, at the behest of their masters, are forced to test the very limits of the imagination - and of love. A feast for the senses, a fin-de-siècle fantasia of magic and mischief, and the most original love story since The Time Traveler's Wife, The Night Circus is an extraordinary blend of fantasy and reality. It will dazzle readers young and old with its virtuoso performance, and who knows, they might not want to leave the world it creates.",0,0

vVnJKV8aScc,"Hi Jemma, I am sure this will also be another big hit but I don’t think I have quite enough Golden Syrup. I wish I knew why this was such a difficult item to find here in the USA, the same with Clotted Cream. You would think it was a State Secret! The last time I was in Ireland, I just happened to bring 2 jars of it Home along with a couple packages of REAL SCONES! The scones made here are just biscuits, even the ones at the famous State Fair in Washington. I think they pass as a scone because most Americans haven’t had a true Irish Scone or even British scone for that matter! They don’t know what to look for in texture or taste. It is my goal to get a true Irish Scone into the hand of every person in the State of Washington, (I don’t want to be greedy and say the world, at least until the state is fulfilled then I will move forward from there) hehee. Must make realistic goals right, I mean look at you? You did it! Quite Impressive! I am awaiting an invite to visit to tour your facility and work with you and learn from you and your friends (employees) it would be great craic when and if I came home!",1,1

The tram took us through a set that was being actively shot for some movie at the time, and we noted how it looked completely trashed and destroyed - it was just a street scene; some back alley. The guide told us that the set decorators HAD to exaggerate the filth, because once it made it onto the screen, between the lighting methods and the lower resolution of actual film, it would appear normal to viewers. If they dressed it normally as we'd see in real life, on film it would appear unrealistically pristine. Now, things have completely reversed.",1,0

x4SheWJkn6s,"I remember growing up in a small town in Canada, where at the time there were probably like 10 hispanic adults. I remember going to school (elementary, grade 1) and one girl telling me that I couldn't play with them because my hair was black and not blonde like theirs, so i spent all my recess' alone in a corner of the playground because no one wanted to play with me. I remember crying myself to sleep, hating to the idea of having to be alone and ignored again the next day at school. Then one day on a Saturday, a tv show had a girl with black hair, beautiful and so talented, singing a song that i was loving, that uplifted everyone in the room. My mom bought her album and would play it for me all the time, eventually through watching/listening to Selena be confident in every way being who she was, made me feel better. One day, at school again we were having free time and the teacher turned on the radio, Selena started to play and the kids in the class started to dance and asked our teacher what she as saying, the teacher didnt know and she explained Selena is Hispanic/Latina and that she is speaking spanish, she asked me if I knew what she was saying and of course I did, i quickly translated (as best as i could) and suddenly the other kids started talking to me. I don't know, perhaps I was just a sensitive child but Selena really pulled me out of a tough situation, she made me feel like its okay to be me and in the end her music is what made others accept me for who I am. Definitely a legend.",0,0

9gBixJFcSJg,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",0,0

Months before buying one I'd done lots of research on it (as I do with many exciting things I want to buy). Then late November of last year I bought one for over $1,000, and all in all I spent over 2k. I quickly found out it wasn't as easy as I thought it would be, but through playing around, asking questions, and experience I learned so much about taking video and pictures, as well as editing photos and some video. After ups and downs of thinking I'm the worst photographer ever and the best photographer ever, yesterday, I finally got a photo printed for the first time from this camera! And while there still might be so much more to learn, I'm already looking for a Sony mirrorless camera to add to my collection! xD Gotta add a mirrorless edition to my arsenal of cameras!

I'm not making this a religious issue, I'm talking about the ecosystem. And if we don't die, the world won't have room for us. Death IS a natural thing. You leave room and you become food for the ground that gives food to the living. It's a cycle. It used to work well (nature) until we started messing with that and started to want to live forever. Every living thing dies, and it's fine. It's our iinacceptance and fear of the unknown (death) that moves us as human beings. But don't be fooled thinking it's a matter of changing things.

vVnJKV8aScc,"Hi Jemma, I am sure this will also be another big hit but I don’t think I have quite enough Golden Syrup. I wish I knew why this was such a difficult item to find here in the USA, the same with Clotted Cream. You would think it was a State Secret! The last time I was in Ireland, I just happened to bring 2 jars of it Home along with a couple packages of REAL SCONES! The scones made here are just biscuits, even the ones at the famous State Fair in Washington. I think they pass as a scone because most Americans haven’t had a true Irish Scone or even British scone for that matter! They don’t know what to look for in texture or taste. It is my goal to get a true Irish Scone into the hand of every person in the State of Washington, (I don’t want to be greedy and say the world, at least until the state is fulfilled then I will move forward from there) hehee. Must make realistic goals right, I mean look at you? You did it! Quite Impressive!

Q7o163QU8CE,"last year i was in a show that our director wrote that was called when the curtain falls !!  it was about a young brother and sister who stumbled across an abandoned theatre and characters from previous musicals came to life. it was about their journey and all the characters they met. \\nthe story perfectly intertwined songs from musicals; i remember part of the story where the little girl was separated from her brother, so she sang 'On My Own' from Le Miserables, and then she met Ursula from The Little Mermaid and the witch stole her voice with the song 'Poor Unfortunate Souls', and then the girl was the puppet in the ventriloquist act from Chicago in 'They Both Reached for the Gun' because she couldn't talk, and she finally met Maria and the children from The Sound Of Music who taught her how to talk again with 'Do Re Me'. she was reunited with her brother after singing 'Home' from Beauty and the Beast. we finished the show singing 'Do You Here the People Sing' from Les Miserables because we (as the forgotten about characters) had been rediscovered and were loved once again, and we were dressed as the characters from the shows. it was such a good story line, and so great to perform because there were so many different musical numbers. \\n\\nmaybe this could inspire your new book carrie !! it even has the same name, after all. Congratulations !! x",1,0

Q7o163QU8CE,"I have a book recommendation for you! It's probably the most amazing book I have read this year, apart from On The Other Side of course. It's called 'The Night Circus' and it was written by Erin Morgenstern. It is truly amazing and each of the characters are gorgeous and profound. Here's the blurb and I hope that one day you can find and enjoy this book as I have.\\nIn 1886 a mysterious travelling circus becomes an international sensation. Open only at night, constructed entirely in black and white, the Cirque des Rêves delights all who wander its circular paths and warm themselves at its bonfire. There are contortionists, performing cats, carousels and illusionists - all the trappings of an ordinary circus. But this is no conventional spectacle. Some tents contain clouds, some ice. The circus seems almost to cast a spell over its aficionados, who call themselves the rêveurs - the dreamers. And who is the sinister man in the grey suit who watches over it all? Behind the scenes a dangerous game is being played out by two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who, at the behest of their masters, are forced to test the very limits of the imagination - and of love. A feast for the senses, a fin-de-siècle fantasia of magic and mischief, and the most original love story since The Time Traveler's Wife, The Night Circus is an extraordinary blend of fantasy and reality. It will dazzle readers young and old with its virtuoso performance, and who knows, they might not want to leave the world it creates.",0,2

c_9iv9HwO5Q,"You know, that's an interesting comment Adam made about the increase in resolution of modern films and modern digital projectors (not to mention BluRay on your TV at home). Some 20-odd years ago, I did the Universal Studios tour in southern California. The tram took us through a set that was being actively shot for some movie at the time, and we noted how it looked completely trashed and destroyed - it was just a street scene; some back alley. The guide told us that the set decorators HAD to exaggerate the filth, because once it made it onto the screen, between the lighting methods and the lower resolution of actual film, it would appear normal to viewers. If they dressed it normally as we'd see in real life, on film it would appear unrealistically pristine. Now, things have completely reversed.",1,0

c_9iv9HwO5Q,This movie was given way too much money. They gave Ridley very little money to do the first one and it turned out well. Its not about the money. Yet the sequel cost $150m + god knows how much for marketing. For a niche sci fi movie thats insane. But because it fit Hollywood's anti capitalist narrative the money spiggots were set to kill.,0,0

mcRHpJyn4B8,"I realized you described my journey with cameras. :D For many years I've been obsessed over DSLRs and wanted to get one. Months before buying one I'd done lots of research on it (as I do with many exciting things I want to buy). Then late November of last year I bought one for over $1,000, and all in all I spent over 2k. I quickly found out it wasn't as easy as I thought it would be, but through playing around, asking questions, and experience I learned so much about taking video and pictures, as well as editing photos and some video. After ups and downs of thinking I'm the worst photographer ever and the best photographer ever, yesterday, I finally got a photo printed for the first time from this camera! And while there still might be so much more to learn, I'm already looking for a Sony mirrorless camera to add to my collection! xD Gotta add a mirrorless edition to my arsenal of cameras! It'll be kinda learning a camera's operating features all over again! :D",0,0

9gBixJFcSJg,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",0,0

C25qzDhGLx8,"2:45 Immortal generation? There's no such thing. I mean, you're talking about aging. More strictly, aging-related illnesses. As Aubrey de Grey well pointed out, even if we beat aging people will die of traumatic injuries and all sort of non-aging related diseases (remember only 70% of all deaths in the world is caused by aging-related illness.)",0,0
C25qzDhGLx8,Would be nice if this video covered the logistics of how the earth has limited space and drastically less deaths means that we cannot support the current rate of births etc,0,0
C25qzDhGLx8,"Interesting argument, but there's one little problem with it: Death and age are - in fact - inevitable, and what's more, we can prove it. Our universe is going to become uninhabitable in 30 billion years or so and will eventually run out of energy due to entropy. And this is perhaps the simplest argument that demonstrates that nothing lasts forever. It may sound nice and poetic to say that age is a disease that should be eradicated but it is inevitable. Age is simply a process governed by the physical laws of the universe that state that nothing is free and nothing lasts forever. Even if we succeed in prolonging our youth and live longer and longer lives, we will still break down and wither and age and eventually die, assuming of course we escape mortal injury from both our own hands and each other. And even if we can get through all that, we are STILL going to meet our end because with everyone living longer and dying less, our population will further explode. We are overpopulated as it is. Our numbers increase by the milliions each year and we are using more and more resources and eventually, they will run out. We're already responsible for the beginning of the next mass extinction our planet has seen, and if we don't take steps to reduce our imprint, we may end being responsible for our own demise. \\n\\nThere's another flaw in your argument, concerning the idea that humans have 'romanticized' death to where we seem like we might almost accept and embrace it. News flash: religion is still a thing that exists, something that demonstrates without a doubt that humans still fear death and try to do anything and everything to escape it's embrace. A VAST majority of the world's population believes in life after death, that death is not an end but merely a transition into another life that will last forever. Most people are willing to believe in anything that comforts and protects them from the knowledge that they will eventually die, and what's more, they're willing to ensure they're children believe the same things to protects themselves from any scrutiny they might face from a child's innocent questions. People have romanticized death, yes, but most of them probably didn't do it in the manner that you suggest.\\n\\nI'm all for minimizing pain and suffering and increasing happiness and well-being, but I recognize that at a certain point, the returns begin to dimmish. You are correct in calling anyone who promotes pain and suffering to help one appreciate the good and the health one has (or for any other reason for that matter) a monster. But to suggest that it's possible to end all suffering is absurd. And it is so for the simple reason that we as a species like to differentiate. We compare and contrast just about every aspect of our lives, our environment, and our fellow primates. Good without bad just is. There's no way to tell one without the other because it is a result of how our minds work. There are certain things we will tend to like and there are certain things that we will tend to not; that is our reality. Everyone is going to enjoy something in their lives, and they are also going to find things that they will not. What helps us appreciate the good things in our lives isn't unnecessary pain but the memory of the pain and suffering that does come to us. It something for us to compare to and it helps us realize and appreciate the good things we do have. Death and age aren't good or bad, they just are.\\n\\nI don't want to die, and I'm not certain I will ever want to die. I fear dying, I fear ceasing to exist and missing out on the future of my family, my friends and the overall future of our race. But I do not fear death, because at that point I won't care because my brain won't be functioning to experience death. I see no reason to view death as good or bad, it just is. But just as romanticizing death is madness, fancying oneself as capable of being immortal is just as insane, because eventually swords and shields wear out too.",0,0
C25qzDhGLx8,"If immortality can be done it needs little support. At the very least the scientist will want it for themselves and if they achieved it would be eternal fame and fortune.

But then you're still prone to accidents, or other ways of coming into harm. \\n\\nAlso, what do we know about the storage limits of the human brain?

Cancer is a disease that is literally due to cells not dying like they are supposed to. Death is absolutely necessary to life, and I'm sorry but when you factor in how much humans have fucked up the planet, on top of overpopulation creating horrifying quality of life issues, plus the impending threat of automation eliminating a slew of jobs and leaving most of the world's workers obsolete with no means of making an income, I really can't see any reason why humans not dying would be even remotely close to a good idea.",0,0

C25qzDhGLx8,"I disagree, accepting death and accepting that there is nothing after this life is a necessary part of life — it does shape your life for the better.

If your life was say, 200 years than what’s to stop you from living in the present? If I know that I only have ~60-70 years before I become disheveled than the choices I make today will be with that knowledge. Conversely if I know I can live another 160 years, why not just say “I can start ____ in 20 years, I have plenty of time”. \\n\\nAccepting death can allow you to enjoy your life",1,0

vVnJKV8aScc,"Hi Jemma, I am sure this will also be another big hit but I don’t think I have quite enough Golden Syrup. I wish I knew why this was such a difficult item to find here in the USA, the same with Clotted Cream. You would think it was a State Secret! The last time I was in Ireland, I just happened to bring 2 jars of it Home along with a couple packages of REAL SCONES! The scones made here are just biscuits, even the ones at the famous State Fair in Washington. I think they pass as a scone because most Americans haven’t had a true Irish Scone or even British scone for that matter! They don’t know what to look for in texture or taste. It is my goal to get a true Irish Scone into the hand of every person in the State of Washington, (I don’t want to be greedy and say the world, at least until the state is fulfilled then I will move forward from there) hehee. Must make realistic goals right, I mean look at you? You did it! Quite Impressive!

Q7o163QU8CE,"last year i was in a show that our director wrote that was called when the curtain falls !!  it was about a young brother and sister who stumbled across an abandoned theatre and characters from previous musicals came to life. it was about their journey and all the characters they met. \\nthe story perfectly intertwined songs from musicals; i remember part of the story where the little girl was separated from her brother, so she sang 'On My Own' from Le Miserables, and then she met Ursula from The Little Mermaid and the witch stole her voice with the song 'Poor Unfortunate Souls', and then the girl was the puppet in the ventriloquist act from Chicago in 'They Both Reached for the Gun' because she couldn't talk, and she finally met Maria and the children from The Sound Of Music who taught her how to talk again with 'Do Re Me'. she was reunited with her brother after singing 'Home' from Beauty and the Beast. we finished the show singing 'Do You Here the People Sing' from Les Miserables because we (as the forgotten about characters) had been rediscovered and were loved once again, and we were dressed as the characters from the shows. it was such a good story line, and so great to perform because there were so many different musical numbers. \\n\\nmaybe this could inspire your new book carrie !! it even has the same name, after all.

Some 20-odd years ago, I did the Universal Studios tour in southern California. The tram took us through a set that was being actively shot for some movie at the time, and we noted how it looked completely trashed and destroyed - it was just a street scene; some back alley. The guide told us that the set decorators HAD to exaggerate the filth, because once it made it onto the screen, between the lighting methods and the lower resolution of actual film, it would appear normal to viewers. If they dressed it normally as we'd see in real life, on film it would appear unrealistically pristine. Now, things have completely reversed.",1,0
