Se trata de una de las canciones que quedaron guardadas cuando la banda brit√°nica estaba componiendo uno de los √°lbumes m√°s influyentes de su carrera: El OK Computer (1997).\\nDos d√©cadas despu√©s, el tema vio la luz en OKNOTOK. La reedici√≥n incluye el disco original, las 8 caras b y tres temas in√©ditos que el grupo ha tocado en directo pero cuyas versiones de estudio jam√°s han visto la luz. Estas son ‚ÄúMan of War‚Äù y ‚ÄúI Promise‚Äú y Lift, todas ya con su correspondiente nuevo v√≠deoclip.\\nLas im√°genes de Lift est√°n dirigidas por el brit√°nico Oscar Hudson, que ha trabajado con la banda desde el lanzamiento de A Moon Shaped Pool (2016). En este v√≠deoclip vemos un surrealista viaje en ascensor protagonizado por el vocalista del grupo, Thom Yorke.  En el trayecto se encuentra con diversos personajes y situaciones, pero como se indica en la canci√≥n, no todo es lo que parece.\\nM√∫sica independiente novedades.",0,0

u6iVspBWzZU,"Okay so this is no way me trying to get sympathy, because I am doing very well mentally. This is mainly out of curiosity. So, summer 2016 I was really really I'll, basically I was in and out of hospital for a month, I had three surgeries and basically lost a lot of weight. Anyway, I went back to school four days after getting out of hospital (only for like an hour a day) and it definitely tired me out a lot. Basically what I'm trying to say is that during my recovery time I'd feel a lot of things described in the video. It wasn't constant (like it is for Dodie) but a lot of the time I'd feel like I was almost in a dream, and nothing really felt real. I wasn't too worried as it didn't happen for long periods at a time and it didn't happen lots. Also my memory of when I was ill is quite foggy and I can't pinpoint specific moments. So, I was wondering if you can get derealisation that only lasts for a short time. Because once I got better it stopped happening.

u6iVspBWzZU,"i don't know what type of dissociation i suffer from but i believe it's some type of mix between derealisation and depersonalisation. when i experience it (which is quite often) it feels like a different world in my head. it's basically like i'm writing a book/a whole different universe every time i experience it. it is a continuous story but when i get tired of it or when somehow i start writing a new world the older one doesn't feel right anymore and it stresses me out to force myself to continue with the older one. everybody in my universe (i believe that they're called paracosmos in the literature world) has their own set story and life and thoughts and i can project myself onto any of them and live as them and that's how i deal with my real life issues - i make up some storyline that somehow makes my character feel in a similar way to the way i'm feeling irl and deal with it by not being myself per say. some characters are reoccurring since i was 14 (i have experienced this since i was 12 but i recall moments when i was 7/8 of very similar situations) and others die with the paracosmos i leave behind (i still remember them and their lives and all of that jazz, and sometimes i bring them back) (characters can stay alive but i change parts of their storyline and you know i make sure they fit into whatever world i picture). it is mostly triggered and stimulated by audio and visuals and when i watch a movie or a tv show and a character from those really speak to certain parts of me i almost always make sure to include parts of them in my paracosmos (i don't know if i'm expressing myself correctly). i also feel very attached and connected to them. i do lose keep track of time and sometimes space when i experience this and i do have gaps in memory because of this. i also have a really weird sense of time like it still feels like 2012 in my head (i was 12 at the time). i also experience this involuntarily when i'm in a not so positive mood and have lots of stress and anxiety or when i'm sad and all that jazz. when i'm happy it cools down a bit and i can sort of choose when to write it? like i know that if i listen to music when i'm happy i will dissociate and i know that if i'm walking by myself i will also do it etc. aside from this when i'm living in the real world i do experience feeling like i'm out of my body and i'm not inside of it (specially in social situations and when i have to interact with people) it feels like i'm in a movie you know? there's a lot more stuff that goes around this thing but i feel like i've written too much so i'm going to keep it to myself. also sorry if there are any mistakes i'm not a native english speaker x",0,0

Not the clean kind of OCD, the hoarding. So for 12 years I live in copious amounts of trash and filth, and of course I was never allowed friends over. I was constantly verbally abused by her but I never really understood what that meant at the time. It got so bad I had to share a bedroom with my dad, brother and me. Thankfully my dad and brother moved out to a house next door that we previously rented. It's still too ugly and mouldy to ever invite friends (I've never had a birthday party) but I'm so so thankful that I actually get to move around my house and freely enter any room without being bombarded with trash... Sorry if this is tmi I've just never told this to anyone, not even my counsellor. I'm 13 years old now and it still really affects my day to day life. I've never been diagnosed with anything but I have self harmed and had one suicide attempt. I constantly feel pessimistic about my future. I get good grades, but I'm extremely anti social.

Something about school triggers it, but I don't know what. With depersonalization, I often, since I was very little, have felt disconnected with my body. I would look at my hands and feel weird, and try stomping my feet to make me feel connected, but nothing would work. I just felt like I was floating separate from my body. Eventually, it would pass, and I never thought much of it. Now, I can put a name to it and try to tell people how I feel!

Something about school triggers it, but I don't know what. With depersonalization, I often, since I was very little, have felt disconnected with my body. I would look at my hands and feel weird, and try stomping my feet to make me feel connected, but nothing would work. I just felt like I was floating separate from my body. Eventually, it would pass, and I never thought much of it. Now, I can put a name to it and try to tell people how I feel!

u6iVspBWzZU,"This video was VERY helpful for me to explain the differences between the 3 words. I have disassociation every single day, as other things happening in my body adds to this part of me going: ah, shit! Panic! Let's get out of this body quickly! It can show on me in many ways- feel like I'm floating being tied to a balloon so there's still this level of groundedness, or I have moments, especially when I'm not on my anxiety meds, where I just feel loony and I cannot connect what I am seeing to me, as if I am in a video game or I'm always strapped into a VR headset, it's terrifying and no one I've said about it so far really thinks this is real or it's not all in my head, so I just wanted to say thank you Dodie and her Therapist friend hehe ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",0,0

u6iVspBWzZU,"Hi! I have a question/need advice:\\nI took a math test yesterday and as I started getting more stressed because of time, I could feel myself getting more and more sucked away. After I came to terms with the fact that I wasn't gonna finish it, I decided to do the easy ones on the back, but I couldn't even remember how to do a simple factoring problem. My mind wasn't there at all. I was wondering how to fix this/bring my mind back when this happens? When it does come back after I get out of that situation, panic attacks come on because everything rushes at me at once. Any ways to bring my mind back to focus WHILE it happens, then not get flooded afterwards?",0,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"Thanks for sharing this. I feel like your videos can really help a lot new moms and future moms. You talk about topics that really happens- the good, the bad, and the ugly! I'm a mom of two and my milk didn't come in until the 4th day for both of my babies. The second time around was much easier as I knew what to expect, but as a first time mom with my son it was so frustrating. He wound latch on properly, but I knew he wasn't getting much because he wasn't having enough wet and poopy diapers. Ultimately, I had to supplement with formula for a few days until he started gaining weight again. Breastfeeding isn't easy. It literally sucks the life out of you üòÇ. Would I do it all over again? Heck yeah! Knowing that I can produce milk to nourish my baby is such an amazing feeling!",60,0

I am also small chested and I always felt that because I am small chested then I would never be able to breastfeed, which actually happened.

It was still pretty difficult to tell others and get them to understand my situation because they just think I'm selfish or don't care because I was not breastfeeding.",0,0

First my twins and now my singleton who will be 1 in a week. BF my twins was very difficult with latch issues, tongue ties, exclusively pumping for a few months, lots of pain, inverted nipples and mastitis. Luckily, after BF for 2 years and through my pregnancy, when my third came along, I had no pain and no issues. Through the past 11 months I've pumped to donate milk to mama's who aren't able to produce as much. Its been satisfying but I know it'll be hard to wean, when the time comes, knowing this is my last baby.",0,0

I noticed my second child is much more clingy to me, I think because we bonded during feedings. Now I have the problem of weaning her.

The freedom I will have once this is over will be incredible. That, and my breasts are in such bad shape - bruised and itching for the past month.

I will be able to pump 5 oz right at the week mark. But little one just refuse to latch on, so I have to get the nipple shield to get him latch.

Zmi9iQp6944,Im glad you had an overall good experience.  Breastfeeding doesn't have to be difficult and people will scare you with horror stories but it's no big deal really.  I've had two babies with upper lip ties and poor latches (their upper lips are turned in) but they breastfed great and I've never had to supplement with formula.  I have a good milk supply because I eat eat eat and don't worry about losing the baby weight right away.  Women have breastfed since the beginning of time and modern women are overthinking it.,1,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"I'm breastfeeding my son, and he had horrendous skin problems from when he was about 3/4 months old. Turned out he was allergic to wheat, dairy, oats, nuts and soya! At that point he was only breastfeeding, so I had to cut all of those out of my diet, which was soooo hard! Later he was retested and only reacted to wheat, dairy and nuts. He's now turned 2 and still breastfeeds, mainly just when he wants to go to sleep. Thank you for sharing your story!",0,0

I literally felt the same way you did at the beginning, because my daughter didn't have any issues latching on, but my milk didn't come in for about 5 days. So I had to supplement with formula, and I felt so disappointed and frustrated with myself. Those first few days at home were the worst, because I couldn't produce enough milk for my baby. My baby is about two months now, and I'm still breastfeeding, although my milk supply is still not completely enough for her. But thank you for sharing your story.

Zmi9iQp6944,"Congratulations on having good boobs!  I was not so lucky.  Before I gave birth my midwife warned me that my boobs might not work so well for breastfeeding because the nipples were fairly flat, but I had made up my mind that I was going to make it work no matter what because of all the health benefits for both me and my baby.  I chose to deliver naturally with no pain medication at all because my family has a history of allergies and I didn't want to risk the baby having a reaction to one of the drugs.  Delivering the baby without pain meds was painful, but it was nothing compared to the pain of my nipples stretching out and bleeding for WEEKS in the beginning of breastfeeding.  To make things worse, my baby had protein intolerance to wheat, dairy, eggs, and oats proteins in my milk.  He threw up entire feedings and had bloody diapers before I figured out that I needed to go on a crazy elimination diet to figure out what he was reacting to.  I lost tons of weight, had to do night shifts with my husband holding him up on our chests so he could sleep, almost lost my mind, and felt the worst pain in my life.  But bloody diapers stopped immediately after the diet, and after a year he outgrew those protein intolerances and could eat normal food except eggs.  Breastfeeding was then enjoyable.  In fact, I breastfed him through age 2.  He also eventually outgrew the egg allergy.  I like my body and myself better now for getting through that because it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.  My nipples stick out now, but my boobs don't sag.  I didn't gain a crazy amount of pregnancy weight though so maybe that helped.  Good luck to anyone pregnant, trying to conceive, or postpartum.  It's hard, but so worth it.",0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,YES! New mother here and my breastfeeding journey was super rocky especially at the beginning. Thank you SO much for touching on all aspects of the good and bad of breastfeeding! I tried talking to my mom about this at the beginning but it was just so frustrating because she didn't understand since she didn't BF. I was constantly in fear of it producing enough milk for my baby. I actually preferred pumping at the beginning because my baby had an awful latch so pumping was more comfortable for me plus it was easy to see how much she was eating. Then I had the dreaded clogged duct a few weeks ago and started tO EBF for two weeks straight and realized afterwards that I never wanted to go back to pumping because there's just SO much stuff to clean with pumping!!! Unfortunately I'm going back to work next week so I had to start pumping again to get her used to a bottle again... would LOVE to see a video about transitioning aria to solids and about her sleep schedule! Would also love to see a what's in your diaper bag vid!,0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,With my first I remember freaking out the first night we had her home thinking she was starving because I KNEW I didn't have enough milk. I had my husband run to the store in the middle of the night just to get formula. I  wanted to exclusively breastfeed. But I couldn't watch her cry from being hungry. After that my milk came in and breastfeeding was a breeze. It was trying to stop after almost 2 years that was the hard part üòÜ,0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"I quit breast feeding after 5 months because my daughter kept biting my nipple, I just gave up and gave her formula because I couldn't handle her bitting...I'm glad I weened her off early because she kept sleeping after eating and that was my only routine breast feed then her sleeping on me. Brest feeding is slot of work I don't think I could do it for a whole year...good for you Jen.",0,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"Due to my experience of having two boys. Feeding a baby formula, especially to a newborn can be tricky. They suck in a lot of gas from the bottle. So, it's a good idea to feed them a few ounces, stop, and burp. Then, feed them some more ounces. If they take the whole bottle all at once, they do throw up. I had a very hard time breastfeeding my two boys, they had a hard time latching properly. I had to supplement with formula and pump exclusively for the first 2-3 months. I hated pumping, it hurt too much. Plus, I didn't produce much breastmilk. I pumped as much as I can, only getting 2 ozs per pump session. I was very depressed and blamed myself for being a bad mom. I would cry every day. I had a c-section with my first (now 7 yrs old) and my second (now 2 yrs old), I had a VBAC. In the end, my boys are healthy, happy, and full of life. Seeing that, I feel that I did something right. And I am much more content in that sense. Thanks for sharing your journey Jen!

My son was born small (4lb 8oz) at full term because of unforeseen circumstances and I was always worried I wasn't feeding enough. Even today there are some days we use formula when we need to. I made my goal of six months BF... now he is slowly self weaning. \\n\\nHe is now a fat 7 month old and thriving. Parents, fed is best! #fedisbest.",0,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"Hi Jen, thanks for sharing your story. I gave birth 3 weeks ago and am going through the whole breastfeeding process now. Like you, I wanted to exclusively breastfeed, however my anatomy just wasn't working with me. It's very difficult for my baby to latch on and one breast produces more milk than the other. My milk also didn't come in for a few days and I got guilted from multiple family members about why I wasn't producing milk already and/or why was I not producing enough milk. It was very tiring and depressing and eventually I did give in to supplementing with formula and my baby is healthy and eating well. Since she doesn't like my nipple shape much, I'm having to pump a majority of the time which isn't what I wanted but it's working and generating milk for her so I'm ok with that. Thanks for mentioning the mastitis symptoms. I actually didn't know about that so I'll definitely be on the lookout for any signs. I'm really glad you decided to make these videos. I can truly relate to all of them and I'm learning things as well from your experience. Not enough people talk about the process after the 9 months of pregnancy and I think these videos are truly an eye opener and guide. Thank you!",0,0

Zmi9iQp6944,Thanks for sharing such a vulnerable experience. I'm currently breastfeeding our 3 month old and the first month was definitely one of the most difficult and stressful things I had to go through. My milk didn't come in until day 5 and even then I wasn't making enough milk and had to supplement with formula for the fist month. Plus I had such a forceful letdown on my left breast that it was so painful to breastfeed her from that side... But I stuck it out and now it is so much better. I still struggle with my supply but I'm making enough that I haven't had to give her any formula for the last 2 months so I'm super proud! My goal is breastfeed for at least 6 months but I'm pretty satisfied that I made it this far.,0,0

Zmi9iQp6944,I still remember how my first few days were hell as i had to go through painful moments where my nipples were sore and blistered and breasts so engorged with milk. But I never give up. I wanted to feel 'complete'. Plus my baby refused formula milk . I'm as petite as Jen only slightly bigger and taller and I still breastfeed my son who's turning 2 at the end of this month. Constantly I get people asking when will i stop breastfeeding him. My answer is when he wants to. He eats a good diet and does drink  milk like soy milk or almond milk every now and then. I've tried so hard when he was a baby to feed him formula but he just refused. I'm happy to breastfeed him. üòä,2,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"Thanks for the honest video. Trying to nurse my early full term posterior tongue tied baby was one of the hardest things I've ever done. It was so much work: months of having the baby latched on for countless hours per day, line feeding, a bout of jaundice, pumping round the clock, seeing multiple doctors, six lactation consultants, physical therapists, etc. He's now six months and while it's mostly pumping here, I so treasure the handful of times per day I'm able to nurse my little one. Sometimes breastfeeding isn't what we expected it to be and it doesn't always work out for everyone. That's okay. The hormones combined with self imposed expectations and societal pressures make seem it seem like the biggest potential failure as a mom. Yes breast milk is great, but formula isn't the end of the world. And neither is exclusively pumping. \\n\\nEnjoy those babies, in the end it goes by too fast. ‚ù§Ô∏è",1,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"Hi Jen, you are very lucky that you were able to exclusively BF your baby and even more lucky that you hit your goal. It was my dream before I had my baby that I will exclusively BF. But things didn't work out as plan. I was a 1st time mom with no help on what to do. My husband works a week after I gave birth, my baby had a latching issue that I didn't know at first until I asked a doctor and it turned out she has a upper lip tie. I ended up exclusively pumping up to 7 months but to be honest with it was really really hard. But seeing my baby now, oh my gosh!!! Every pain, every fever and every sacrifice that I went through are all worth it!!!!!!!! Thank you for sharing your experience. Cheers to all the mommas out there.",1,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"Jen, thanks for sharing your story! Feeding your baby the first time can be very demanding and almost discouraging because for the amount of time you invest in feeding your baby. And when mom invests so much time, they usually have this heavy expectation that they're baby should be healthy and gaining weight. So, when the results don't show as expected, it's really discouraging for the amount work they put in. Breast feeding is still a stigma, especially when it comes to breastfeeding in public. Not to mention the times working moms have to step out of their office to pump breast milk. The whole process is just a hassle... but if a mom is determined it's really rewarding.\\nEven though health care staffs recommend mothers to breastfeed their child for at least 12 months, most moms usually stop by the first month, so good for you Jen for successfully meeting your goal. \\nOne thing to keep in mind for new moms is that..... baby's stomach is TINY. If we overfeed them, they throw up. If we feed them too fast, they also throw up. Better not to throw up than not feeding enough. Breastfeeding gives a perfect amount. And even if some mom's don't produce enough milk the first couple of weeks it's fine,  because the hormone is going to kick in and create the perfect amount for the baby. Remember, first-day milk or colostrum should be the size of a cherry. Day two should be the size of the walnut. By one week it should be the size of the apricot, and by the first month, it should be the size of a large egg. So even if we think we're not giving enough, the reality is, we are. Just have to keep feeding the baby as demanded and our bodies will react to the amount that baby needs.",2,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"For me, despite trying very hard, the milk supply just wasn't enough. Part of it is poor latching, part of it is just that my body doesn't produce enough milk. I ended up pumping and giving my baby half formula and half breastmilk, and did it for 7-8 months. For me, pumping beyond the point where milk was coming out actually helped send the signal to my body to produce more milk, but it only worked to a certain point, beyond which my baby was still hungry, which is why I supplemented with formula. The disappointment is immense because there's SO much saying that the body would always produce enough, that it almost seems socially unacceptable to NOT breastfeed, like you're a failure in not providing the best for the baby when not exclusively breastfeeding. Well guess what - the true failure is when the baby starves because Mummy wants to feel like she's doing her job breastfeeding! I think it's more important to do your best breastfeeding but be open and pay attention to your baby and what he/ she needs! So my advice to new mummies are to do your best, but don't beat yourself up if you do have to supplement or feed formula, relax and just do your best!",1,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"Thanks for sharing your story! Before having my daughter I also told myself I'll give breastfeeding my best try and see how it goes. Supply wasn't my issue (I'm 6 months in and still have oversupply) but it was my daughters tongue tie. Her tongue couldn't extend because of a tight frenulum causing her to suck extra hard. My nipples were bleeding by day 2, chapped and raw. Even air made them throb with pain. I got a consultant who let me know that she 100% had tongue tie. We ended up having to make a decision to get her tongue tie cut on week 2. It was either that or continue feeding her on my bleeding nipples, and hope for the best. The pain was so bad I was constantly sobbing while feeding my daughter. As soon as we had her tongue tie cut feeding was PAINLESS. I realized oh wow...so breastfeeding is actually not supposed to hurt. There were some people out there that made me feel terrible for cutting my daughters frenulum - but 6 months on and realizing how minor of a procedure it was for the trade off of painless breastfeeding...so so so worth it. Every mommy has to make their own choices that are best for their babies and themselves.",0,1

Zmi9iQp6944,"Thanks for sharing this. I feel like your videos can really help a lot new moms and future moms. You talk about topics that really happens- the good, the bad, and the ugly! I'm a mom of two and my milk didn't come in until the 4th day for both of my babies. The second time around was much easier as I knew what to expect, but as a first time mom with my son it was so frustrating. He wound latch on properly, but I knew he wasn't getting much because he wasn't having enough wet and poopy diapers. Ultimately, I had to supplement with formula for a few days until he started gaining weight again. Breastfeeding isn't easy. It literally sucks the life out of you üòÇ. Would I do it all over again? Heck yeah! Knowing that I can produce milk to nourish my baby is such an amazing feeling!",60,0

I am also small chested and I always felt that because I am small chested then I would never be able to breastfeed, which actually happened. Although I understand that it is not because of the size but the body. It was still pretty difficult to tell others and get them to understand my situation because they just think I'm selfish or don't care because I was not breastfeeding.",0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"Thank you for sharing this!! There isn't enough real life experiences about BF out there! \\n\\nI've been BF 3 years straight with 3 babies. First my twins and now my singleton who will be 1 in a week. BF my twins was very difficult with latch issues, tongue ties, exclusively pumping for a few months, lots of pain, inverted nipples and mastitis. Luckily, after BF for 2 years and through my pregnancy, when my third came along, I had no pain and no issues. Through the past 11 months I've pumped to donate milk to mama's who aren't able to produce as much. Its been satisfying but I know it'll be hard to wean, when the time comes, knowing this is my last baby.",0,0

I noticed my second child is much more clingy to me, I think because we bonded during feedings. Now I have the problem of weaning her.

I will be able to pump 5 oz right at the week mark. But little one just refuse to latch on, so I have to get the nipple shield to get him latch.

Zmi9iQp6944,Im glad you had an overall good experience.  Breastfeeding doesn't have to be difficult and people will scare you with horror stories but it's no big deal really.

I have a good milk supply because I eat eat eat and don't worry about losing the baby weight right away.  Women have breastfed since the beginning of time and modern women are overthinking it.,1,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"Congratulations on having good boobs!  I was not so lucky.  Before I gave birth my midwife warned me that my boobs might not work so well for breastfeeding because the nipples were fairly flat, but I had made up my mind that I was going to make it work no matter what because of all the health benefits for both me and my baby.  I chose to deliver naturally with no pain medication at all because my family has a history of allergies and I didn't want to risk the baby having a reaction to one of the drugs.  Delivering the baby without pain meds was painful, but it was nothing compared to the pain of my nipples stretching out and bleeding for WEEKS in the beginning of breastfeeding.  To make things worse, my baby had protein intolerance to wheat, dairy, eggs, and oats proteins in my milk.  He threw up entire feedings and had bloody diapers before I figured out that I needed to go on a crazy elimination diet to figure out what he was reacting to.  I lost tons of weight, had to do night shifts with my husband holding him up on our chests so he could sleep, almost lost my mind, and felt the worst pain in my life.  But bloody diapers stopped immediately after the diet, and after a year he outgrew those protein intolerances and could eat normal food except eggs.  Breastfeeding was then enjoyable.  In fact, I breastfed him through age 2.  He also eventually outgrew the egg allergy.  I like my body and myself better now for getting through that because it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.  My nipples stick out now, but my boobs don't sag.  I didn't gain a crazy amount of pregnancy weight though so maybe that helped.  Good luck to anyone pregnant, trying to conceive, or postpartum.  It's hard, but so worth it.",0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,YES! New mother here and my breastfeeding journey was super rocky especially at the beginning. Thank you SO much for touching on all aspects of the good and bad of breastfeeding! I tried talking to my mom about this at the beginning but it was just so frustrating because she didn't understand since she didn't BF. I was constantly in fear of it producing enough milk for my baby. I actually preferred pumping at the beginning because my baby had an awful latch so pumping was more comfortable for me plus it was easy to see how much she was eating. Then I had the dreaded clogged duct a few weeks ago and started tO EBF for two weeks straight and realized afterwards that I never wanted to go back to pumping because there's just SO much stuff to clean with pumping!!! Unfortunately I'm going back to work next week so I had to start pumping again to get her used to a bottle again... would LOVE to see a video about transitioning aria to solids and about her sleep schedule! Would also love to see a what's in your diaper bag vid!,0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,With my first I remember freaking out the first night we had her home thinking she was starving because I KNEW I didn't have enough milk. I had my husband run to the store in the middle of the night just to get formula. I  wanted to exclusively breastfeed. But I couldn't watch her cry from being hungry. After that my milk came in and breastfeeding was a breeze. It was trying to stop after almost 2 years that was the hard part üòÜ,0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"I quit breast feeding after 5 months because my daughter kept biting my nipple, I just gave up and gave her formula because I couldn't handle her bitting...I'm glad I weened her off early because she kept sleeping after eating and that was my only routine breast feed then her sleeping on me.

Zmi9iQp6944,"Due to my experience of having two boys. Feeding a baby formula, especially to a newborn can be tricky. They suck in a lot of gas from the bottle. So, it's a good idea to feed them a few ounces, stop, and burp. Then, feed them some more ounces. If they take the whole bottle all at once, they do throw up. I had a very hard time breastfeeding my two boys, they had a hard time latching properly. I had to supplement with formula and pump exclusively for the first 2-3 months. I hated pumping, it hurt too much. Plus, I didn't produce much breastmilk. I pumped as much as I can, only getting 2 ozs per pump session. I was very depressed and blamed myself for being a bad mom. I would cry every day. I had a c-section with my first (now 7 yrs old) and my second (now 2 yrs old), I had a VBAC. In the end, my boys are healthy, happy, and full of life. Seeing that, I feel that I did something right. And I am much more content in that sense. Thanks for sharing your journey Jen!

My son was born small (4lb 8oz) at full term because of unforeseen circumstances and I was always worried I wasn't feeding enough. Even today there are some days we use formula when we need to.

Zmi9iQp6944,"Thank you for sharing your breastfeeding journey, Jen! ‚ù§Ô∏è My daughter only breastfed for only 2 weeks because I don't have that much supply to really make her full. She will cries every now and then and I have to fed her formula. Until then, she doesn't want to feed from me anymore. I have suffer from mastitis too, and shit it's hurt. Felt like your boobs had been punched really hard. I would sit and cry every night while holding my breast.

Zmi9iQp6944,I literally cried when my baby wouldn't latch the first and second day. I felt the same like I was a failure and I wasn't going to be a good mom because I couldn't feed my baby. I thought I was never going to never be able to breastfeed.,0,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"Hi Jen, thanks for sharing your story. I gave birth 3 weeks ago and am going through the whole breastfeeding process now. Like you, I wanted to exclusively breastfeed, however my anatomy just wasn't working with me. It's very difficult for my baby to latch on and one breast produces more milk than the other. My milk also didn't come in for a few days and I got guilted from multiple family members about why I wasn't producing milk already and/or why was I not producing enough milk. It was very tiring and depressing and eventually I did give in to supplementing with formula and my baby is healthy and eating well. Since she doesn't like my nipple shape much, I'm having to pump a majority of the time which isn't what I wanted but it's working and generating milk for her so I'm ok with that. Thanks for mentioning the mastitis symptoms. I actually didn't know about that so I'll definitely be on the lookout for any signs. I'm really glad you decided to make these videos. I can truly relate to all of them and I'm learning things as well from your experience. Not enough people talk about the process after the 9 months of pregnancy and I think these videos are truly an eye opener and guide. Thank you!",0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"It took me 7 days for my milk to come in with my second baby. It's different for every mom and every pregnancy too! With my first baby, it came in at 4 days, but I wasn't able to produce enough milk, so we supplemented. But somehow with my second, I've been able to exclusively breastfeed. If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Don't stress and love that baby!",0,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"So interesting to listen to other moms' breastfeeding stories! I have 11 month old twins and was determined to nurse them. My milk took two weeks to really come in, partly because of the C-section and partly because they were born a little early. It broke my heart when I had to supplement with formula those first weeks. But, I was able to exclusively breastfeed them after the first month. I'm still nursing both twins although it's much easier now that they're eating solids.",0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"I HATED pumping too! I had to do it manually when I got back to work.\\nMy boobs got huge too, I barelly could lower my arms!",0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"Mmmhmm,  you're right I think.   Breastfeeding just came natural to me,  latch was EASY and intuitive.  My nipples are small and pokey-outey and just easy for my children to nurse.   Bad thing is I have no advice for moms who occasionally ask me for help as they're shaped SO differently than me with large flat nipples on very large breasts.   I dunno.   Everyone is different.  It's not shameful but we all have different struggles... I just wish I could help more when a mama is right in front of me trying to get their crying baby to latch on.",0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,Thanks for sharing such a vulnerable experience. I'm currently breastfeeding our 3 month old and the first month was definitely one of the most difficult and stressful things I had to go through. My milk didn't come in until day 5 and even then I wasn't making enough milk and had to supplement with formula for the fist month. Plus I had such a forceful letdown on my left breast that it was so painful to breastfeed her from that side... But I stuck it out and now it is so much better. I still struggle with my supply but I'm making enough that I haven't had to give her any formula for the last 2 months so I'm super proud! My goal is breastfeed for at least 6 months but I'm pretty satisfied that I made it this far.,0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"I love you Jen! I've been following you forever since I was a teenager, I mean years, back to your Kansas, acne routines, and everything, your first video with wongfu!

Zmi9iQp6944,I'm so glad you made this video! I just gave birth Saturday and having the same issues of producing enough milk for the baby and the anxiety of knowing you didn't feed them enough is heartbreaking. Knowing what you went through and what I'm going through right now definitely helps me s lot because it lets me know I'm not out there alone in the same situation. So thank you Jen!,1,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"Thank you for all these mommy videos, <33 super informative and can't thank you enough for your honesty ^___^ ‚ù§Ô∏è",1,0
Zmi9iQp6944,I still remember how my first few days were hell as i had to go through painful moments where my nipples were sore and blistered and breasts so engorged with milk. But I never give up. I wanted to feel 'complete'. Plus my baby refused formula milk . I'm as petite as Jen only slightly bigger and taller and I still breastfeed my son who's turning 2 at the end of this month. Constantly I get people asking when will i stop breastfeeding him. My answer is when he wants to. He eats a good diet and does drink  milk like soy milk or almond milk every now and then. I've tried so hard when he was a baby to feed him formula but he just refused. I'm happy to breastfeed him. üòä,2,0

Zmi9iQp6944,Breastfeeding is good up to 2 years old :),1,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"Thanks for the honest video. Trying to nurse my early full term posterior tongue tied baby was one of the hardest things I've ever done. It was so much work: months of having the baby latched on for countless hours per day, line feeding, a bout of jaundice, pumping round the clock, seeing multiple doctors, six lactation consultants, physical therapists, etc. He's now six months and while it's mostly pumping here, I so treasure the handful of times per day I'm able to nurse my little one. Sometimes breastfeeding isn't what we expected it to be and it doesn't always work out for everyone. That's okay. The hormones combined with self imposed expectations and societal pressures make seem it seem like the biggest potential failure as a mom. Yes breast milk is great, but formula isn't the end of the world. And neither is exclusively pumping. \\n\\nEnjoy those babies, in the end it goes by too fast. ‚ù§Ô∏è",1,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"Hi Jen, you are very lucky that you were able to exclusively BF your baby and even more lucky that you hit your goal. It was my dream before I had my baby that I will exclusively BF. But things didn't work out as plan. I was a 1st time mom with no help on what to do. My husband works a week after I gave birth, my baby had a latching issue that I didn't know at first until I asked a doctor and it turned out she has a upper lip tie. I ended up exclusively pumping up to 7 months but to be honest with it was really really hard. But seeing my baby now, oh my gosh!!! Every pain, every fever and every sacrifice that I went through are all worth it!!!!!!!! Thank you for sharing your experience. Cheers to all the mommas out there.",1,0
Zmi9iQp6944,Im a new mom and I could relate to everything you said on this video. Thank you so much for sharing :),1,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"Jen, thanks for sharing your story! Feeding your baby the first time can be very demanding and almost discouraging because for the amount of time you invest in feeding your baby. And when mom invests so much time, they usually have this heavy expectation that they're baby should be healthy and gaining weight. So, when the results don't show as expected, it's really discouraging for the amount work they put in. Breast feeding is still a stigma, especially when it comes to breastfeeding in public. Not to mention the times working moms have to step out of their office to pump breast milk. The whole process is just a hassle... but if a mom is determined it's really rewarding.\\nEven though health care staffs recommend mothers to breastfeed their child for at least 12 months, most moms usually stop by the first month, so good for you Jen for successfully meeting your goal. \\nOne thing to keep in mind for new moms is that..... baby's stomach is TINY. If we overfeed them, they throw up. If we feed them too fast, they also throw up. Better not to throw up than not feeding enough. Breastfeeding gives a perfect amount. And even if some mom's don't produce enough milk the first couple of weeks it's fine,  because the hormone is going to kick in and create the perfect amount for the baby. Remember, first-day milk or colostrum should be the size of a cherry. Day two should be the size of the walnut. By one week it should be the size of the apricot, and by the first month, it should be the size of a large egg. So even if we think we're not giving enough, the reality is, we are. Just have to keep feeding the baby as demanded and our bodies will react to the amount that baby needs.",2,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"For me, despite trying very hard, the milk supply just wasn't enough. Part of it is poor latching, part of it is just that my body doesn't produce enough milk. I ended up pumping and giving my baby half formula and half breastmilk, and did it for 7-8 months. For me, pumping beyond the point where milk was coming out actually helped send the signal to my body to produce more milk, but it only worked to a certain point, beyond which my baby was still hungry, which is why I supplemented with formula. The disappointment is immense because there's SO much saying that the body would always produce enough, that it almost seems socially unacceptable to NOT breastfeed, like you're a failure in not providing the best for the baby when not exclusively breastfeeding. Well guess what - the true failure is when the baby starves because Mummy wants to feel like she's doing her job breastfeeding! I think it's more important to do your best breastfeeding but be open and pay attention to your baby and what he/ she needs! So my advice to new mummies are to do your best, but don't beat yourself up if you do have to supplement or feed formula, relax and just do your best!",1,0

Zmi9iQp6944,I totally feel for you hence it happened to me too. But unfortunately my baby wouldn't take the bottle after I went exclusively breast feeding for 2 weeks. I struggled with feeding my baby enough milk by 5 months so I had to start solids earlier. My body started decreasing on production before my baby was ready.,1,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"I think it would be really interesting to hear from your husband how he felt throughout the whole process in terms of your labour and breastfeeding and everything else that comes along with having a baby. We don't often hear from men and their experiences as a new father so I think it would be fascinating! I'm also really glad that you are so open when it comes to pregnancy and motherhood because so many people glamourise it and hide all the difficult aspects that it actually comes with, so it's great that you are making people more aware of the reality!",4,1

I agree with you, i am so happy that I breastfed my baby!",0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,You need to eat alot to be able to produce milk for breastfeeding. And alot of nourishing food that produces milk in your body. If they are not latching on you can pump it out for your baby. I had to eat twice as much to have milk for my baby. And in Asian cultures there are special food you need to eat to bring your body back all the nutrients you lose during birth.,0,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"Thanks for sharing your story! Before having my daughter I also told myself I'll give breastfeeding my best try and see how it goes. Supply wasn't my issue (I'm 6 months in and still have oversupply) but it was my daughters tongue tie. Her tongue couldn't extend because of a tight frenulum causing her to suck extra hard. My nipples were bleeding by day 2, chapped and raw. Even air made them throb with pain. I got a consultant who let me know that she 100% had tongue tie. We ended up having to make a decision to get her tongue tie cut on week 2. It was either that or continue feeding her on my bleeding nipples, and hope for the best. The pain was so bad I was constantly sobbing while feeding my daughter. As soon as we had her tongue tie cut feeding was PAINLESS. I realized oh wow...so breastfeeding is actually not supposed to hurt. There were some people out there that made me feel terrible for cutting my daughters frenulum - but 6 months on and realizing how minor of a procedure it was for the trade off of painless breastfeeding...so so so worth it. Every mommy has to make their own choices that are best for their babies and themselves.",0,1

Zmi9iQp6944,"I think it would be really interesting to hear from your husband how he felt throughout the whole process in terms of your labour and breastfeeding and everything else that comes along with having a baby. We don't often hear from men and their experiences as a new father so I think it would be fascinating! I'm also really glad that you are so open when it comes to pregnancy and motherhood because so many people glamourise it and hide all the difficult aspects that it actually comes with, so it's great that you are making people more aware of the reality!",17,2
Zmi9iQp6944,Im glad you had an overall good experience.  Breastfeeding doesn't have to be difficult and people will scare you with horror stories but it's no big deal really.  I've had two babies with upper lip ties and poor latches (their upper lips are turned in) but they breastfed great and I've never had to supplement with formula.  I have a good milk supply because I eat eat eat and don't worry about losing the baby weight right away.  Women have breastfed since the beginning of time and modern women are overthinking it.,4,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"Thank you for the video Jen! I wanted to breast feed my baby so badly (I'm not sure if it ever occurred to me that there was a possibility I wouldn't be able too) but it wasn't a success for me. I remember asking the nurses, doctors, lactation specialists, basically anyone who knew anything how I would KNOW that my baby was getting milk and no one would give me a straight answer! It was so incredibly frustrating! My baby was having rising bilirubin counts (developing pretty bad jaundice), spent a lot of the time crying, and wouldn't stay latched to me (even with a good latch) for the first week plus of her life. Our pediatrician finally recommended I supplement with formula and it was a god send. All of a sudden she slept for hours on end, her weight was going up, bilirubin was going down and she was so happy. My baby was doing so much better. But to this day (she's 2 years old) I still have lingering feelings of failure over not being able to provide such a basic thing for my baby. I loved hearing your story, it was wonderful insight on something I hopefully get to experience one day if I become pregnant again.",0,0

And I had to go back to work by the 4 month so I continuing to try to BF was almost impossible. You are very lucky.

Zmi9iQp6944,"The concept of 10% body weight loss being the max is so frustrating! If you've had any IVs during the labor process (or if you've been pumped full of LOTS of fluids for a cesarean) your baby's birthweight is inflated from water weight! My middle child was 9 pounds even and my youngest was just over 8. Thankfully my pediatrician is very much a trust your instincts doctor because otherwise I would have given up breastfeeding entirely. \\n\\nAs far as my journey goes, I only nursed my eldest for two weeks. External circumstances (lack of support) and lack of knowledge contributed to that. My middle child I nursed and then exclusively pumped for several months. It is a pain, but if any new moms are reading this I highly recommend ordering extra pump parts if you're going to be pumping frequently! I think I got a couple extra sets for $12 each on Amazon. \\n\\nI'm currently nursing my four month old daughter. It has been a completely different experience! I think as you said anatomy is a huge part of it. I pumped for my second child because the pain never stopped and I didn't know to have him checked for a tongue or lip tie--which in hindsight is likely the case. But my daughter? Right at the two week mark the pain stopped! And I even had a cracked nipple and bled so much she had a blood mustache but it didn't hurt! I don't think I'm necessarily trying HARDER to make it work with my daughter, but we're just an inherently better fit AND I'm much more knowledgeable. I highly recommend any new moms joining local La Leche League or other breastfeeding support groups before giving birth just to read through some of the frequent issues and solutions. \\n\\nFed is obviously best. My eldest who was primarily formula fed has had very few illnesses, and the same with my middle child who only had a few months of breastmilk! They've got EBF cousins who have had more frequent viral and bacterial illnesses, so the whole concept that breastmilk is a cure-all preventative magical mana from heaven liquid is unfair to moms who struggle with guilt from switching to formula. Do what you need to do to stay sane--your baby needs you healthy and happy most of all.",0,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"Suckling is work done it stimulates the body to make more milk so never think that it's a waste of time. It also provides comfort for the child.\\n\\nYou are lucky most will have to use dual electric pumps to stimulate if the baby is sleepy to suckle all the time or just for the mom to get more sleep too use the pump to kick start the milk.\\n\\nThe baby shits 1st few days too!! So surely there is some weight loss too!! \\n\\nYour emotions are at a mess up to 6 months post birthing so it's very normal to feel like that just press on press on.\\n\\nEven if one doesn't breast feed don't feel too bad just move on and love baby and let them grow, enjoy baby's\\nGrowing moments",0,0

With my second child I was so determined to breastfeed her so I stuck with it no matter how tired and frustrated I got. I noticed my second child is much more clingy to me, I think because we bonded during feedings. Now I have the problem of weaning her.

Zmi9iQp6944,"Hi Jen! My baby was actually born with a cleft lip. Thank goodness it was mild, but he still did not latch, and i believe it was more of an anatomical mismatch. He'll be 8 months the end of this month and I'm still pumping. I hate it but he doesn't like formula and I want to make the effort for him. Pumping is the worst, especially when you work full time.

I will be able to pump 5 oz right at the week mark. But little one just refuse to latch on, so I have to get the nipple shield to get him latch.

Zmi9iQp6944,"Congratulations on having good boobs!  I was not so lucky.  Before I gave birth my midwife warned me that my boobs might not work so well for breastfeeding because the nipples were fairly flat, but I had made up my mind that I was going to make it work no matter what because of all the health benefits for both me and my baby.  I chose to deliver naturally with no pain medication at all because my family has a history of allergies and I didn't want to risk the baby having a reaction to one of the drugs.  Delivering the baby without pain meds was painful, but it was nothing compared to the pain of my nipples stretching out and bleeding for WEEKS in the beginning of breastfeeding.  To make things worse, my baby had protein intolerance to wheat, dairy, eggs, and oats proteins in my milk.  He threw up entire feedings and had bloody diapers before I figured out that I needed to go on a crazy elimination diet to figure out what he was reacting to.  I lost tons of weight, had to do night shifts with my husband holding him up on our chests so he could sleep, almost lost my mind, and felt the worst pain in my life.  But bloody diapers stopped immediately after the diet, and after a year he outgrew those protein intolerances and could eat normal food except eggs.  Breastfeeding was then enjoyable.  In fact, I breastfed him through age 2.  He also eventually outgrew the egg allergy.  I like my body and myself better now for getting through that because it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.  My nipples stick out now, but my boobs don't sag.  I didn't gain a crazy amount of pregnancy weight though so maybe that helped.  Good luck to anyone pregnant, trying to conceive, or postpartum.  It's hard, but so worth it.",0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,YES! New mother here and my breastfeeding journey was super rocky especially at the beginning. Thank you SO much for touching on all aspects of the good and bad of breastfeeding! I tried talking to my mom about this at the beginning but it was just so frustrating because she didn't understand since she didn't BF. I was constantly in fear of it producing enough milk for my baby. I actually preferred pumping at the beginning because my baby had an awful latch so pumping was more comfortable for me plus it was easy to see how much she was eating. Then I had the dreaded clogged duct a few weeks ago and started tO EBF for two weeks straight and realized afterwards that I never wanted to go back to pumping because there's just SO much stuff to clean with pumping!!! Unfortunately I'm going back to work next week so I had to start pumping again to get her used to a bottle again... would LOVE to see a video about transitioning aria to solids and about her sleep schedule! Would also love to see a what's in your diaper bag vid!,0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,With my first I remember freaking out the first night we had her home thinking she was starving because I KNEW I didn't have enough milk. I had my husband run to the store in the middle of the night just to get formula. I  wanted to exclusively breastfeed. But I couldn't watch her cry from being hungry. After that my milk came in and breastfeeding was a breeze. It was trying to stop after almost 2 years that was the hard part üòÜ,0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"I quit breast feeding after 5 months because my daughter kept biting my nipple, I just gave up and gave her formula because I couldn't handle her bitting...I'm glad I weened her off early because she kept sleeping after eating and that was my only routine breast feed then her sleeping on me.

Zmi9iQp6944,"Due to my experience of having two boys. Feeding a baby formula, especially to a newborn can be tricky. They suck in a lot of gas from the bottle. So, it's a good idea to feed them a few ounces, stop, and burp. Then, feed them some more ounces. If they take the whole bottle all at once, they do throw up. I had a very hard time breastfeeding my two boys, they had a hard time latching properly. I had to supplement with formula and pump exclusively for the first 2-3 months. I hated pumping, it hurt too much. Plus, I didn't produce much breastmilk. I pumped as much as I can, only getting 2 ozs per pump session. I was very depressed and blamed myself for being a bad mom. I would cry every day. I had a c-section with my first (now 7 yrs old) and my second (now 2 yrs old), I had a VBAC. In the end, my boys are healthy, happy, and full of life.

My son was born small (4lb 8oz) at full term because of unforeseen circumstances and I was always worried I wasn't feeding enough. Even today there are some days we use formula when we need to.

I don't think my baby's ready to wean any time soon. And like you mentioned, I'm not ready for him to wean either. So I'm really glad you mentioned post-breastfeeding hormones and depression because I didn't know that could happen. Now, at least I know what to expect.",0,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"Hi Jen, thanks for sharing your story. I gave birth 3 weeks ago and am going through the whole breastfeeding process now. Like you, I wanted to exclusively breastfeed, however my anatomy just wasn't working with me. It's very difficult for my baby to latch on and one breast produces more milk than the other. My milk also didn't come in for a few days and I got guilted from multiple family members about why I wasn't producing milk already and/or why was I not producing enough milk. It was very tiring and depressing and eventually I did give in to supplementing with formula and my baby is healthy and eating well. Since she doesn't like my nipple shape much, I'm having to pump a majority of the time which isn't what I wanted but it's working and generating milk for her so I'm ok with that. Thanks for mentioning the mastitis symptoms. I actually didn't know about that so I'll definitely be on the lookout for any signs. I'm really glad you decided to make these videos. I can truly relate to all of them and I'm learning things as well from your experience. Not enough people talk about the process after the 9 months of pregnancy and I think these videos are truly an eye opener and guide. Thank you!",0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"It took me 7 days for my milk to come in with my second baby. It's different for every mom and every pregnancy too! With my first baby, it came in at 4 days, but I wasn't able to produce enough milk, so we supplemented. But somehow with my second, I've been able to exclusively breastfeed. If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Don't stress and love that baby!",0,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"So interesting to listen to other moms' breastfeeding stories! I have 11 month old twins and was determined to nurse them. My milk took two weeks to really come in, partly because of the C-section and partly because they were born a little early. It broke my heart when I had to supplement with formula those first weeks. But, I was able to exclusively breastfeed them after the first month. I'm still nursing both twins although it's much easier now that they're eating solids.",0,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"Mmmhmm,  you're right I think.   Breastfeeding just came natural to me,  latch was EASY and intuitive.  My nipples are small and pokey-outey and just easy for my children to nurse.   Bad thing is I have no advice for moms who occasionally ask me for help as they're shaped SO differently than me with large flat nipples on very large breasts.   I dunno.   Everyone is different.  It's not shameful but we all have different struggles... I just wish I could help more when a mama is right in front of me trying to get their crying baby to latch on.",0,0

Zmi9iQp6944,Thanks for sharing such a vulnerable experience. I'm currently breastfeeding our 3 month old and the first month was definitely one of the most difficult and stressful things I had to go through. My milk didn't come in until day 5 and even then I wasn't making enough milk and had to supplement with formula for the fist month. Plus I had such a forceful letdown on my left breast that it was so painful to breastfeed her from that side... But I stuck it out and now it is so much better. I still struggle with my supply but I'm making enough that I haven't had to give her any formula for the last 2 months so I'm super proud! My goal is breastfeed for at least 6 months but I'm pretty satisfied that I made it this far.,0,0

I'm on the 2nd attempt, miscarried on the 1st. Talk about feeling like a failure. As a woman you were really designed to do 1 thing and that is have a baby and when it doesn't happen you feel like you are a failure and worthless. Even though it's not your fault and you are doing EVERYTHING you can you still FEEL like it's your fault. I'm not even a mum yet and I'm already failing at the 1st step of even getting pregnant.

Zmi9iQp6944,"Thanks for the honest video. Trying to nurse my early full term posterior tongue tied baby was one of the hardest things I've ever done. It was so much work: months of having the baby latched on for countless hours per day, line feeding, a bout of jaundice, pumping round the clock, seeing multiple doctors, six lactation consultants, physical therapists, etc. He's now six months and while it's mostly pumping here, I so treasure the handful of times per day I'm able to nurse my little one. Sometimes breastfeeding isn't what we expected it to be and it doesn't always work out for everyone. That's okay. The hormones combined with self imposed expectations and societal pressures make seem it seem like the biggest potential failure as a mom. Yes breast milk is great, but formula isn't the end of the world. And neither is exclusively pumping. \\n\\nEnjoy those babies, in the end it goes by too fast. ‚ù§Ô∏è",1,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"Hi Jen, you are very lucky that you were able to exclusively BF your baby and even more lucky that you hit your goal. It was my dream before I had my baby that I will exclusively BF. But things didn't work out as plan. I was a 1st time mom with no help on what to do. My husband works a week after I gave birth, my baby had a latching issue that I didn't know at first until I asked a doctor and it turned out she has a upper lip tie. I ended up exclusively pumping up to 7 months but to be honest with it was really really hard. But seeing my baby now, oh my gosh!!! Every pain, every fever and every sacrifice that I went through are all worth it!!!!!!!! Thank you for sharing your experience. Cheers to all the mommas out there.",1,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"Jen, thanks for sharing your story! Feeding your baby the first time can be very demanding and almost discouraging because for the amount of time you invest in feeding your baby. And when mom invests so much time, they usually have this heavy expectation that they're baby should be healthy and gaining weight. So, when the results don't show as expected, it's really discouraging for the amount work they put in. Breast feeding is still a stigma, especially when it comes to breastfeeding in public. Not to mention the times working moms have to step out of their office to pump breast milk. The whole process is just a hassle... but if a mom is determined it's really rewarding.\\nEven though health care staffs recommend mothers to breastfeed their child for at least 12 months, most moms usually stop by the first month, so good for you Jen for successfully meeting your goal. \\nOne thing to keep in mind for new moms is that..... baby's stomach is TINY. If we overfeed them, they throw up. If we feed them too fast, they also throw up. Better not to throw up than not feeding enough. Breastfeeding gives a perfect amount. And even if some mom's don't produce enough milk the first couple of weeks it's fine,  because the hormone is going to kick in and create the perfect amount for the baby. Remember, first-day milk or colostrum should be the size of a cherry. Day two should be the size of the walnut. By one week it should be the size of the apricot, and by the first month, it should be the size of a large egg. So even if we think we're not giving enough, the reality is, we are. Just have to keep feeding the baby as demanded and our bodies will react to the amount that baby needs.",2,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"Thanks for sharing your story! Before having my daughter I also told myself I'll give breastfeeding my best try and see how it goes. Supply wasn't my issue (I'm 6 months in and still have oversupply) but it was my daughters tongue tie. Her tongue couldn't extend because of a tight frenulum causing her to suck extra hard. My nipples were bleeding by day 2, chapped and raw. Even air made them throb with pain. I got a consultant who let me know that she 100% had tongue tie. We ended up having to make a decision to get her tongue tie cut on week 2. It was either that or continue feeding her on my bleeding nipples, and hope for the best. The pain was so bad I was constantly sobbing while feeding my daughter. As soon as we had her tongue tie cut feeding was PAINLESS. I realized oh wow...so breastfeeding is actually not supposed to hurt. There were some people out there that made me feel terrible for cutting my daughters frenulum - but 6 months on and realizing how minor of a procedure it was for the trade off of painless breastfeeding...so so so worth it. Every mommy has to make their own choices that are best for their babies and themselves.",1,2

I agree with you, i am so happy that I breastfed my baby!",0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,You need to eat alot to be able to produce milk for breastfeeding. And alot of nourishing food that produces milk in your body. If they are not latching on you can pump it out for your baby. I had to eat twice as much to have milk for my baby. And in Asian cultures there are special food you need to eat to bring your body back all the nutrients you lose during birth.,0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,Im a new mom and I could relate to everything you said on this video. Thank you so much for sharing :),1,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"For me, despite trying very hard, the milk supply just wasn't enough. Part of it is poor latching, part of it is just that my body doesn't produce enough milk. I ended up pumping and giving my baby half formula and half breastmilk, and did it for 7-8 months. For me, pumping beyond the point where milk was coming out actually helped send the signal to my body to produce more milk, but it only worked to a certain point, beyond which my baby was still hungry, which is why I supplemented with formula. The disappointment is immense because there's SO much saying that the body would always produce enough, that it almost seems socially unacceptable to NOT breastfeed, like you're a failure in not providing the best for the baby when not exclusively breastfeeding. Well guess what - the true failure is when the baby starves because Mummy wants to feel like she's doing her job breastfeeding! I think it's more important to do your best breastfeeding but be open and pay attention to your baby and what he/ she needs! So my advice to new mummies are to do your best, but don't beat yourself up if you do have to supplement or feed formula, relax and just do your best!",2,1
Zmi9iQp6944,"I'm a bottle baby and I'm fine and I'm glad my mother wasn't shamed for it. I see all these heartbreaking stories and it's just horrible.

It was H√ºsker D√º's swan song in a way, after the sad and hurtful break up of the genius collaboration that was Grant Hart and Bob Mould. It's funny, because *_Candy Apple Grey_* was arguably their best album - certainly their most commercially accessible. It will go down as one of my favorites of all time.",6,1

And I say this as a long time viewer and supporter. \\n\\nLook i get going places requires a lot of time, traveling and money. But I feel like you're missing the point why people started liking you in the first place and you're going the wrong way in terms of making other content. It was the social interactions, you should stick to that.\\n\\nI don't know how your life looks like right now, if you're really busy or something, so maybe this is the best and fastest way to churn out other content. And I'm sorry to say this but it's just not appealing anymore, at this point I've stopped being subbed and just look you up from time to time for the more fun videos. \\n\\nAnd I get it, I'm not expecting you to go to cons or other conventions every week. But there has to be other alternatives, what happened to the dates, those were fun.\\n\\nYou can try other stuff. Just go out, start random interviews with people on the street about some recent topic or something. I don't know what the format can be, but you can brainstorm on that. Ask us, the viewers, there's probably lots of people more creative than me who can think of things. \\n\\n\\nAnyway I hope you get this man, hit me back, just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan.\\n\\nP.S.

Zmi9iQp6944,"I think it would be really interesting to hear from your husband how he felt throughout the whole process in terms of your labour and breastfeeding and everything else that comes along with having a baby. We don't often hear from men and their experiences as a new father so I think it would be fascinating! I'm also really glad that you are so open when it comes to pregnancy and motherhood because so many people glamourise it and hide all the difficult aspects that it actually comes with, so it's great that you are making people more aware of the reality!",19,2
Zmi9iQp6944,Im glad you had an overall good experience.  Breastfeeding doesn't have to be difficult and people will scare you with horror stories but it's no big deal really.  I've had two babies with upper lip ties and poor latches (their upper lips are turned in) but they breastfed great and I've never had to supplement with formula.  I have a good milk supply because I eat eat eat and don't worry about losing the baby weight right away.  Women have breastfed since the beginning of time and modern women are overthinking it.,4,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"Thank you for the video Jen! I wanted to breast feed my baby so badly (I'm not sure if it ever occurred to me that there was a possibility I wouldn't be able too) but it wasn't a success for me. I remember asking the nurses, doctors, lactation specialists, basically anyone who knew anything how I would KNOW that my baby was getting milk and no one would give me a straight answer! It was so incredibly frustrating! My baby was having rising bilirubin counts (developing pretty bad jaundice), spent a lot of the time crying, and wouldn't stay latched to me (even with a good latch) for the first week plus of her life. Our pediatrician finally recommended I supplement with formula and it was a god send. All of a sudden she slept for hours on end, her weight was going up, bilirubin was going down and she was so happy. My baby was doing so much better. But to this day (she's 2 years old) I still have lingering feelings of failure over not being able to provide such a basic thing for my baby. I loved hearing your story, it was wonderful insight on something I hopefully get to experience one day if I become pregnant again.",0,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"The concept of 10% body weight loss being the max is so frustrating! If you've had any IVs during the labor process (or if you've been pumped full of LOTS of fluids for a cesarean) your baby's birthweight is inflated from water weight! My middle child was 9 pounds even and my youngest was just over 8. Thankfully my pediatrician is very much a trust your instincts doctor because otherwise I would have given up breastfeeding entirely. \\n\\nAs far as my journey goes, I only nursed my eldest for two weeks. External circumstances (lack of support) and lack of knowledge contributed to that. My middle child I nursed and then exclusively pumped for several months. It is a pain, but if any new moms are reading this I highly recommend ordering extra pump parts if you're going to be pumping frequently! I think I got a couple extra sets for $12 each on Amazon. \\n\\nI'm currently nursing my four month old daughter. It has been a completely different experience! I think as you said anatomy is a huge part of it. I pumped for my second child because the pain never stopped and I didn't know to have him checked for a tongue or lip tie--which in hindsight is likely the case. But my daughter? Right at the two week mark the pain stopped! And I even had a cracked nipple and bled so much she had a blood mustache but it didn't hurt! I don't think I'm necessarily trying HARDER to make it work with my daughter, but we're just an inherently better fit AND I'm much more knowledgeable. I highly recommend any new moms joining local La Leche League or other breastfeeding support groups before giving birth just to read through some of the frequent issues and solutions. \\n\\nFed is obviously best. My eldest who was primarily formula fed has had very few illnesses, and the same with my middle child who only had a few months of breastmilk! They've got EBF cousins who have had more frequent viral and bacterial illnesses, so the whole concept that breastmilk is a cure-all preventative magical mana from heaven liquid is unfair to moms who struggle with guilt from switching to formula. Do what you need to do to stay sane--your baby needs you healthy and happy most of all.",0,0

I will be able to pump 5 oz right at the week mark. But little one just refuse to latch on, so I have to get the nipple shield to get him latch.

Zmi9iQp6944,"Congratulations on having good boobs!  I was not so lucky.  Before I gave birth my midwife warned me that my boobs might not work so well for breastfeeding because the nipples were fairly flat, but I had made up my mind that I was going to make it work no matter what because of all the health benefits for both me and my baby.  I chose to deliver naturally with no pain medication at all because my family has a history of allergies and I didn't want to risk the baby having a reaction to one of the drugs.  Delivering the baby without pain meds was painful, but it was nothing compared to the pain of my nipples stretching out and bleeding for WEEKS in the beginning of breastfeeding.  To make things worse, my baby had protein intolerance to wheat, dairy, eggs, and oats proteins in my milk.  He threw up entire feedings and had bloody diapers before I figured out that I needed to go on a crazy elimination diet to figure out what he was reacting to.  I lost tons of weight, had to do night shifts with my husband holding him up on our chests so he could sleep, almost lost my mind, and felt the worst pain in my life.  But bloody diapers stopped immediately after the diet, and after a year he outgrew those protein intolerances and could eat normal food except eggs.  Breastfeeding was then enjoyable.  In fact, I breastfed him through age 2.  He also eventually outgrew the egg allergy.  I like my body and myself better now for getting through that because it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.  My nipples stick out now, but my boobs don't sag.  I didn't gain a crazy amount of pregnancy weight though so maybe that helped.  Good luck to anyone pregnant, trying to conceive, or postpartum.  It's hard, but so worth it.",0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,YES! New mother here and my breastfeeding journey was super rocky especially at the beginning. Thank you SO much for touching on all aspects of the good and bad of breastfeeding! I tried talking to my mom about this at the beginning but it was just so frustrating because she didn't understand since she didn't BF. I was constantly in fear of it producing enough milk for my baby. I actually preferred pumping at the beginning because my baby had an awful latch so pumping was more comfortable for me plus it was easy to see how much she was eating. Then I had the dreaded clogged duct a few weeks ago and started tO EBF for two weeks straight and realized afterwards that I never wanted to go back to pumping because there's just SO much stuff to clean with pumping!!! Unfortunately I'm going back to work next week so I had to start pumping again to get her used to a bottle again... would LOVE to see a video about transitioning aria to solids and about her sleep schedule! Would also love to see a what's in your diaper bag vid!,0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,With my first I remember freaking out the first night we had her home thinking she was starving because I KNEW I didn't have enough milk. I had my husband run to the store in the middle of the night just to get formula. I  wanted to exclusively breastfeed. But I couldn't watch her cry from being hungry.

Zmi9iQp6944,"Due to my experience of having two boys. Feeding a baby formula, especially to a newborn can be tricky. They suck in a lot of gas from the bottle. So, it's a good idea to feed them a few ounces, stop, and burp. Then, feed them some more ounces. If they take the whole bottle all at once, they do throw up. I had a very hard time breastfeeding my two boys, they had a hard time latching properly. I had to supplement with formula and pump exclusively for the first 2-3 months. I hated pumping, it hurt too much. Plus, I didn't produce much breastmilk. I pumped as much as I can, only getting 2 ozs per pump session. I was very depressed and blamed myself for being a bad mom. I would cry every day. I had a c-section with my first (now 7 yrs old) and my second (now 2 yrs old), I had a VBAC. In the end, my boys are healthy, happy, and full of life.

My son was born small (4lb 8oz) at full term because of unforeseen circumstances and I was always worried I wasn't feeding enough. Even today there are some days we use formula when we need to.

Zmi9iQp6944,"Hi Jen, thanks for sharing your story. I gave birth 3 weeks ago and am going through the whole breastfeeding process now. Like you, I wanted to exclusively breastfeed, however my anatomy just wasn't working with me. It's very difficult for my baby to latch on and one breast produces more milk than the other. My milk also didn't come in for a few days and I got guilted from multiple family members about why I wasn't producing milk already and/or why was I not producing enough milk. It was very tiring and depressing and eventually I did give in to supplementing with formula and my baby is healthy and eating well. Since she doesn't like my nipple shape much, I'm having to pump a majority of the time which isn't what I wanted but it's working and generating milk for her so I'm ok with that. Thanks for mentioning the mastitis symptoms. I actually didn't know about that so I'll definitely be on the lookout for any signs. I'm really glad you decided to make these videos. I can truly relate to all of them and I'm learning things as well from your experience. Not enough people talk about the process after the 9 months of pregnancy and I think these videos are truly an eye opener and guide. Thank you!",0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"It took me 7 days for my milk to come in with my second baby. It's different for every mom and every pregnancy too! With my first baby, it came in at 4 days, but I wasn't able to produce enough milk, so we supplemented. But somehow with my second, I've been able to exclusively breastfeed. If it happens, it happens. If it doesn't, it doesn't. Don't stress and love that baby!",0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,And then there is nursing aversion,0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,I have 3 kids and my first 2 i didn't have the patience to breastfeed them but my last baby I did breastfed her and I LOVED it.  I love the closeness that I get with her.  Love your video Jen,1,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"Thanks for the honest video. Trying to nurse my early full term posterior tongue tied baby was one of the hardest things I've ever done. It was so much work: months of having the baby latched on for countless hours per day, line feeding, a bout of jaundice, pumping round the clock, seeing multiple doctors, six lactation consultants, physical therapists, etc. He's now six months and while it's mostly pumping here, I so treasure the handful of times per day I'm able to nurse my little one. Sometimes breastfeeding isn't what we expected it to be and it doesn't always work out for everyone. That's okay. The hormones combined with self imposed expectations and societal pressures make seem it seem like the biggest potential failure as a mom. Yes breast milk is great, but formula isn't the end of the world. And neither is exclusively pumping. \\n\\nEnjoy those babies, in the end it goes by too fast. ‚ù§Ô∏è",1,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"Hi Jen, you are very lucky that you were able to exclusively BF your baby and even more lucky that you hit your goal. It was my dream before I had my baby that I will exclusively BF. But things didn't work out as plan. I was a 1st time mom with no help on what to do. My husband works a week after I gave birth, my baby had a latching issue that I didn't know at first until I asked a doctor and it turned out she has a upper lip tie. I ended up exclusively pumping up to 7 months but to be honest with it was really really hard. But seeing my baby now, oh my gosh!!! Every pain, every fever and every sacrifice that I went through are all worth it!!!!!!!! Thank you for sharing your experience. Cheers to all the mommas out there.",1,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"Jen, thanks for sharing your story! Feeding your baby the first time can be very demanding and almost discouraging because for the amount of time you invest in feeding your baby. And when mom invests so much time, they usually have this heavy expectation that they're baby should be healthy and gaining weight. So, when the results don't show as expected, it's really discouraging for the amount work they put in. Breast feeding is still a stigma, especially when it comes to breastfeeding in public. Not to mention the times working moms have to step out of their office to pump breast milk. The whole process is just a hassle... but if a mom is determined it's really rewarding.\\nEven though health care staffs recommend mothers to breastfeed their child for at least 12 months, most moms usually stop by the first month, so good for you Jen for successfully meeting your goal. \\nOne thing to keep in mind for new moms is that..... baby's stomach is TINY. If we overfeed them, they throw up. If we feed them too fast, they also throw up. Better not to throw up than not feeding enough. Breastfeeding gives a perfect amount. And even if some mom's don't produce enough milk the first couple of weeks it's fine,  because the hormone is going to kick in and create the perfect amount for the baby. Remember, first-day milk or colostrum should be the size of a cherry. Day two should be the size of the walnut. By one week it should be the size of the apricot, and by the first month, it should be the size of a large egg. So even if we think we're not giving enough, the reality is, we are. Just have to keep feeding the baby as demanded and our bodies will react to the amount that baby needs.",2,0
Zmi9iQp6944,I EBF my daughter for 9 months and it was the most tiring 9 months of my life üòÖ I miss the breastfeeding bond for sure but I'm thankful we were able to go for that long!,2,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"Thanks for sharing your story! Before having my daughter I also told myself I'll give breastfeeding my best try and see how it goes. Supply wasn't my issue (I'm 6 months in and still have oversupply) but it was my daughters tongue tie. Her tongue couldn't extend because of a tight frenulum causing her to suck extra hard. My nipples were bleeding by day 2, chapped and raw. Even air made them throb with pain. I got a consultant who let me know that she 100% had tongue tie. We ended up having to make a decision to get her tongue tie cut on week 2. It was either that or continue feeding her on my bleeding nipples, and hope for the best. The pain was so bad I was constantly sobbing while feeding my daughter. As soon as we had her tongue tie cut feeding was PAINLESS. I realized oh wow...so breastfeeding is actually not supposed to hurt. There were some people out there that made me feel terrible for cutting my daughters frenulum - but 6 months on and realizing how minor of a procedure it was for the trade off of painless breastfeeding...so so so worth it. Every mommy has to make their own choices that are best for their babies and themselves.",1,2
Zmi9iQp6944,"For me, despite trying very hard, the milk supply just wasn't enough. Part of it is poor latching, part of it is just that my body doesn't produce enough milk. I ended up pumping and giving my baby half formula and half breastmilk, and did it for 7-8 months. For me, pumping beyond the point where milk was coming out actually helped send the signal to my body to produce more milk, but it only worked to a certain point, beyond which my baby was still hungry, which is why I supplemented with formula. The disappointment is immense because there's SO much saying that the body would always produce enough, that it almost seems socially unacceptable to NOT breastfeed, like you're a failure in not providing the best for the baby when not exclusively breastfeeding. Well guess what - the true failure is when the baby starves because Mummy wants to feel like she's doing her job breastfeeding! I think it's more important to do your best breastfeeding but be open and pay attention to your baby and what he/ she needs! So my advice to new mummies are to do your best, but don't beat yourself up if you do have to supplement or feed formula, relax and just do your best!",2,1

I agree with you, i am so happy that I breastfed my baby!",0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,You need to eat alot to be able to produce milk for breastfeeding. And alot of nourishing food that produces milk in your body. If they are not latching on you can pump it out for your baby. I had to eat twice as much to have milk for my baby. And in Asian cultures there are special food you need to eat to bring your body back all the nutrients you lose during birth.,0,0

QBGaO89cBMI,"I think this song/video is about how life is like an elevator (lift.) The elevator is the mind and you have people constantly entering and getting off, but you are still there alone much of the time. When they are there, it feels like a hassle. At the end he sees himself leaving, but it isn't him, he's still in the elevator. The lyrics sound more like they're about a child who is trapped and wants to go home. I always thought it was more or less about the afterlife. The lift is the transitionary place between life and death, and something you can't return to. Given that this was written right about at the same time A Reminder (look that one up) was written, I think it's fair to say that the song is about a letter to his inner child telling him everything is ok. The video could be the opposite because he never really lives the lift. I suppose if you really wanted to find a broad connection, you could say that he realizes at the end that he can never really leave. The lift is his mind and whenever he tries to leave it he is just finding someone else, and the scenery is more or less an unreal illusion (A metaphor for consciousness, maybe)",1,0

cviyIIvBlto,"Mate, looks like you're making an incendiary device...  two reasons.  Cardboard & fuses.  \\n\\nHeat substantially degrades the life of rechargeable batteries (so insulating them whilst charging/discharging is a really bad idea), & overloads/faults can lead to thermal runaway.  Cardboard is a good insulator (which would exacerbate cell failure and overheating), and it's quite flammable (so keep away from ignition sources like sparks or red hot busbars).  Keep in mind, fire point is 258¬∞C, the ignition temperature 427¬∞C. Please note - when stacked (as in, your battery array), it also has a tendency to heat-induced spontaneous combustion.  Plus it decomposes over time & can attract insects and rodents (rats & mice being the natural enemy of electrical devices...).\\n\\nThere's a reason battery arrays space the cells apart and allow for air circulation (or water cooling).  And also why 'proper' arrays also monitor cell temperature...\\n\\nSecond point - fuses.  Strongly suggest you put a fusible link between each battery and the busbar.  That way you should be able to prevent dumping many amps of power into a failed cell (either when charging, or from other cells), causing it to catch fire and/or explode...  Pretty good idea if you don't have 100% quality control of the batteries you're putting into an array.\\n\\nAnyways... good luck with that!  At least, don't put the array inside your house, any flammable structure, or adjacent to anything you find important...",0,0

It was the social interactions, you should stick to that.\\n\\nI don't know how your life looks like right now, if you're really busy or something, so maybe this is the best and fastest way to churn out other content. And I'm sorry to say this but it's just not appealing anymore, at this point I've stopped being subbed and just look you up from time to time for the more fun videos. \\n\\nAnd I get it, I'm not expecting you to go to cons or other conventions every week. But there has to be other alternatives, what happened to the dates, those were fun.\\n\\nYou can try other stuff.

Look how much amazing science came out of the program, and so many more things will be invented and discovered because of this work. For me, this is what progress really looks like.",0,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"I think it would be really interesting to hear from your husband how he felt throughout the whole process in terms of your labour and breastfeeding and everything else that comes along with having a baby. We don't often hear from men and their experiences as a new father so I think it would be fascinating! I'm also really glad that you are so open when it comes to pregnancy and motherhood because so many people glamourise it and hide all the difficult aspects that it actually comes with, so it's great that you are making people more aware of the reality!",26,2
Zmi9iQp6944,Im glad you had an overall good experience.  Breastfeeding doesn't have to be difficult and people will scare you with horror stories but it's no big deal really.  I've had two babies with upper lip ties and poor latches (their upper lips are turned in) but they breastfed great and I've never had to supplement with formula.  I have a good milk supply because I eat eat eat and don't worry about losing the baby weight right away.  Women have breastfed since the beginning of time and modern women are overthinking it.,4,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"To be honest, I was afraid to watch this video. I was afraid that I would see someone I look up to, and care for in pain. However, I am pleasantly surprised that your heart and mind were strong in that time of change. My experience was different in most aspects except the tiring feedings, constant hunger, and close call with mastitis. I felt really alone in my time of breastfeeding my first child. I was in a relationship where I was used sexually. And breastfeeding while having that part of my body abused sexually by someone I trusted, hurt a lot. And my experience suffered because of it. I cried every time I fed. And most BF moms know how often that happens. CONSTANTLY. I was wrecked and confused. But I successfully fed for about 10 months and happily deemed my little one healthy enough to start semi solid foods and formula. I shouldn't have felt guilty at the time, but I did. And it's important for moms to understand that being unable to breastfeed does NOT mean your body is failing.¬†\\n\\nThank you, in the kindest regards, for sharing <3",0,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"Thank you for the video Jen! I wanted to breast feed my baby so badly (I'm not sure if it ever occurred to me that there was a possibility I wouldn't be able too) but it wasn't a success for me. I remember asking the nurses, doctors, lactation specialists, basically anyone who knew anything how I would KNOW that my baby was getting milk and no one would give me a straight answer! It was so incredibly frustrating! My baby was having rising bilirubin counts (developing pretty bad jaundice), spent a lot of the time crying, and wouldn't stay latched to me (even with a good latch) for the first week plus of her life. Our pediatrician finally recommended I supplement with formula and it was a god send. All of a sudden she slept for hours on end, her weight was going up, bilirubin was going down and she was so happy. My baby was doing so much better. But to this day (she's 2 years old) I still have lingering feelings of failure over not being able to provide such a basic thing for my baby. I loved hearing your story, it was wonderful insight on something I hopefully get to experience one day if I become pregnant again.",0,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"The concept of 10% body weight loss being the max is so frustrating! If you've had any IVs during the labor process (or if you've been pumped full of LOTS of fluids for a cesarean) your baby's birthweight is inflated from water weight! My middle child was 9 pounds even and my youngest was just over 8. Thankfully my pediatrician is very much a trust your instincts doctor because otherwise I would have given up breastfeeding entirely. \\n\\nAs far as my journey goes, I only nursed my eldest for two weeks. External circumstances (lack of support) and lack of knowledge contributed to that. My middle child I nursed and then exclusively pumped for several months. It is a pain, but if any new moms are reading this I highly recommend ordering extra pump parts if you're going to be pumping frequently! I think I got a couple extra sets for $12 each on Amazon. \\n\\nI'm currently nursing my four month old daughter. It has been a completely different experience! I think as you said anatomy is a huge part of it. I pumped for my second child because the pain never stopped and I didn't know to have him checked for a tongue or lip tie--which in hindsight is likely the case. But my daughter? Right at the two week mark the pain stopped! And I even had a cracked nipple and bled so much she had a blood mustache but it didn't hurt! I don't think I'm necessarily trying HARDER to make it work with my daughter, but we're just an inherently better fit AND I'm much more knowledgeable. I highly recommend any new moms joining local La Leche League or other breastfeeding support groups before giving birth just to read through some of the frequent issues and solutions. \\n\\nFed is obviously best. My eldest who was primarily formula fed has had very few illnesses, and the same with my middle child who only had a few months of breastmilk! They've got EBF cousins who have had more frequent viral and bacterial illnesses, so the whole concept that breastmilk is a cure-all preventative magical mana from heaven liquid is unfair to moms who struggle with guilt from switching to formula. Do what you need to do to stay sane--your baby needs you healthy and happy most of all.",0,0

So surely there is some weight loss too!! \\n\\nYour emotions are at a mess up to 6 months post birthing so it's very normal to feel like that just press on press on.\\n\\nEven if one doesn't breast feed don't feel too bad just move on and love baby and let them grow, enjoy baby's\\nGrowing moments",0,0

Zmi9iQp6944,"Congratulations on having good boobs!  I was not so lucky.  Before I gave birth my midwife warned me that my boobs might not work so well for breastfeeding because the nipples were fairly flat, but I had made up my mind that I was going to make it work no matter what because of all the health benefits for both me and my baby.  I chose to deliver naturally with no pain medication at all because my family has a history of allergies and I didn't want to risk the baby having a reaction to one of the drugs.  Delivering the baby without pain meds was painful, but it was nothing compared to the pain of my nipples stretching out and bleeding for WEEKS in the beginning of breastfeeding.  To make things worse, my baby had protein intolerance to wheat, dairy, eggs, and oats proteins in my milk.  He threw up entire feedings and had bloody diapers before I figured out that I needed to go on a crazy elimination diet to figure out what he was reacting to.  I lost tons of weight, had to do night shifts with my husband holding him up on our chests so he could sleep, almost lost my mind, and felt the worst pain in my life.  But bloody diapers stopped immediately after the diet, and after a year he outgrew those protein intolerances and could eat normal food except eggs.  Breastfeeding was then enjoyable.  In fact, I breastfed him through age 2.  He also eventually outgrew the egg allergy.  I like my body and myself better now for getting through that because it was the hardest thing I've ever had to do.  My nipples stick out now, but my boobs don't sag.  I didn't gain a crazy amount of pregnancy weight though so maybe that helped.  Good luck to anyone pregnant, trying to conceive, or postpartum.  It's hard, but so worth it.",0,0

I actually preferred pumping at the beginning because my baby had an awful latch so pumping was more comfortable for me plus it was easy to see how much she was eating. Then I had the dreaded clogged duct a few weeks ago and started tO EBF for two weeks straight and realized afterwards that I never wanted to go back to pumping because there's just SO much stuff to clean with pumping!!! Unfortunately I'm going back to work next week so I had to start pumping again to get her used to a bottle again... would LOVE to see a video about transitioning aria to solids and about her sleep schedule! Would also love to see a what's in your diaper bag vid!,0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,With my first I remember freaking out the first night we had her home thinking she was starving because I KNEW I didn't have enough milk. I had my husband run to the store in the middle of the night just to get formula. I  wanted to exclusively breastfeed. But I couldn't watch her cry from being hungry. After that my milk came in and breastfeeding was a breeze. It was trying to stop after almost 2 years that was the hard part üòÜ,0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"I quit breast feeding after 5 months because my daughter kept biting my nipple, I just gave up and gave her formula because I couldn't handle her bitting...I'm glad I weened her off early because she kept sleeping after eating and that was my only routine breast feed then her sleeping on me. Brest feeding is slot of work I don't think I could do it for a whole year...good for you Jen.",0,0

Zmi9iQp6944,I wish i saw this years ago.  I struggled so much with breastfeeding and felt like a failure for so long.

So proud of you for being so strong and determined!!! Super commendable!!!,0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"Jen (AND ALL PUMPING MOMS): try the Freemie cups. It makes pumping so much more tolerable. No pumping bra needed, you just stick the cups (connected to your pump) in your bra and voila. So much better than the little bottles and membranes. I made it a year exclusively breastfeeding baby, and while I too hated pumping (it's such a time suck), and the Freemies were a big help.",0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,please please please share the sleep experience!,0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"Due to my experience of having two boys. Feeding a baby formula, especially to a newborn can be tricky. They suck in a lot of gas from the bottle. So, it's a good idea to feed them a few ounces, stop, and burp. Then, feed them some more ounces. If they take the whole bottle all at once, they do throw up. I had a very hard time breastfeeding my two boys, they had a hard time latching properly. I had to supplement with formula and pump exclusively for the first 2-3 months. I hated pumping, it hurt too much. Plus, I didn't produce much breastmilk. I pumped as much as I can, only getting 2 ozs per pump session. I was very depressed and blamed myself for being a bad mom. I would cry every day. I had a c-section with my first (now 7 yrs old) and my second (now 2 yrs old), I had a VBAC. In the end, my boys are healthy, happy, and full of life. Seeing that, I feel that I did something right. And I am much more content in that sense. Thanks for sharing your journey Jen! Glad to hear you were able to successfully breast feed Aria for 1 year üôÇ",0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,+From Head To Toe Thank you so much for sharing your experience. You are so brave üòá ! I am not a mom yet but I really admire your mindset about how breasts look.

Zmi9iQp6944,"Love your honest experience. My first experience was similar like yours ; worried, anxious and guilty everytime my baby cried for not having enough milk. And on top of that your whole body is still healing from the delivery. On the 2nd experience i took it easy and learn to relax for things to kick in naturally. And Yes i did use formula (just for top ups) this time for the first few weeks, couldnt bare to starve my baby. But after that milk flow started to pour in :)) Thank God!",0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,I would definitely love to hear about Aria's feeding schedule and more about breastfeeding. My son is about to turn eight and when he was born I didn't breastfeed much due to having to go back to work 2weeks postpartum. I just found out I'm pregnant and I'm trying to gather as much information bcuz it's been such a long time since my last pregnancy.,0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"My favourite video from you! I was lucky as I had an emergency c section but my milk came I at four days. Like you, I said I hoped to BF my baby. If not, formula is okay too! I didn't feel pressure or stressed out despite the lactation consultants being so pushy. My son was born small (4lb 8oz) at full term because of unforeseen circumstances and I was always worried I wasn't feeding enough. Even today there are some days we use formula when we need to. I made my goal of six months BF... now he is slowly self weaning. \\n\\nHe is now a fat 7 month old and thriving. Parents, fed is best! #fedisbest.",0,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"Thank you for sharing your experiences from birth to breastfeeding. It's kind of strange talking about this topic with my own mother because of our culture and the traditional way I was brought up. My husband and I just got married this past summer, and ever since my parents & other relatives have been asking us about when we're going to get pregnant. Before we were married it was When are you getting married? Now it's When are you going to have kids? My mom always offers to help us taking care of the future child but hasn't given actual advice. It's always tips from the medical perspective, like You should have the baby soon to avoid health risks when you're too old. I'm only 28 lol.  I have been subscribed to you for awhile (since watching your tutorials for monolids), and these Momtember videos are so helpful. It feels like you are the older sister I never had.

Zmi9iQp6944,"Thank you for being so detailed and honest. I had a rough start, also went through mastitis, but still breastfeeding at 19 months while pregnant again. I don't think my baby's ready to wean any time soon. And like you mentioned, I'm not ready for him to wean either. So I'm really glad you mentioned post-breastfeeding hormones and depression because I didn't know that could happen. Now, at least I know what to expect.",0,0

I am also small chested and I always felt that because I am small chested then I would never be able to breastfeed, which actually happened. Although I understand that it is not because of the size but the body. It was still pretty difficult to tell others and get them to understand my situation because they just think I'm selfish or don't care because I was not breastfeeding.",2,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"Thank you for sharing this!! There isn't enough real life experiences about BF out there! \\n\\nI've been BF 3 years straight with 3 babies. First my twins and now my singleton who will be 1 in a week. BF my twins was very difficult with latch issues, tongue ties, exclusively pumping for a few months, lots of pain, inverted nipples and mastitis. Luckily, after BF for 2 years and through my pregnancy, when my third came along, I had no pain and no issues. Through the past 11 months I've pumped to donate milk to mama's who aren't able to produce as much. Its been satisfying but I know it'll be hard to wean, when the time comes, knowing this is my last baby.",2,0
Zmi9iQp6944,I have 3 kids and my first 2 i didn't have the patience to breastfeed them but my last baby I did breastfed her and I LOVED it.  I love the closeness that I get with her.  Love your video Jen,1,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"Thanks for the honest video. Trying to nurse my early full term posterior tongue tied baby was one of the hardest things I've ever done. It was so much work: months of having the baby latched on for countless hours per day, line feeding, a bout of jaundice, pumping round the clock, seeing multiple doctors, six lactation consultants, physical therapists, etc. He's now six months and while it's mostly pumping here, I so treasure the handful of times per day I'm able to nurse my little one. Sometimes breastfeeding isn't what we expected it to be and it doesn't always work out for everyone. That's okay. The hormones combined with self imposed expectations and societal pressures make seem it seem like the biggest potential failure as a mom. Yes breast milk is great, but formula isn't the end of the world. And neither is exclusively pumping. \\n\\nEnjoy those babies, in the end it goes by too fast. ‚ù§Ô∏è",1,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"Hi Jen, you are very lucky that you were able to exclusively BF your baby and even more lucky that you hit your goal. It was my dream before I had my baby that I will exclusively BF. But things didn't work out as plan. I was a 1st time mom with no help on what to do. My husband works a week after I gave birth, my baby had a latching issue that I didn't know at first until I asked a doctor and it turned out she has a upper lip tie. I ended up exclusively pumping up to 7 months but to be honest with it was really really hard. But seeing my baby now, oh my gosh!!! Every pain, every fever and every sacrifice that I went through are all worth it!!!!!!!! Thank you for sharing your experience. Cheers to all the mommas out there.",1,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"Jen, thanks for sharing your story! Feeding your baby the first time can be very demanding and almost discouraging because for the amount of time you invest in feeding your baby. And when mom invests so much time, they usually have this heavy expectation that they're baby should be healthy and gaining weight. So, when the results don't show as expected, it's really discouraging for the amount work they put in. Breast feeding is still a stigma, especially when it comes to breastfeeding in public. Not to mention the times working moms have to step out of their office to pump breast milk. The whole process is just a hassle... but if a mom is determined it's really rewarding.\\nEven though health care staffs recommend mothers to breastfeed their child for at least 12 months, most moms usually stop by the first month, so good for you Jen for successfully meeting your goal. \\nOne thing to keep in mind for new moms is that..... baby's stomach is TINY. If we overfeed them, they throw up. If we feed them too fast, they also throw up. Better not to throw up than not feeding enough. Breastfeeding gives a perfect amount. And even if some mom's don't produce enough milk the first couple of weeks it's fine,  because the hormone is going to kick in and create the perfect amount for the baby. Remember, first-day milk or colostrum should be the size of a cherry. Day two should be the size of the walnut. By one week it should be the size of the apricot, and by the first month, it should be the size of a large egg. So even if we think we're not giving enough, the reality is, we are. Just have to keep feeding the baby as demanded and our bodies will react to the amount that baby needs.",2,0
Zmi9iQp6944,"Thanks for sharing your story! Before having my daughter I also told myself I'll give breastfeeding my best try and see how it goes. Supply wasn't my issue (I'm 6 months in and still have oversupply) but it was my daughters tongue tie. Her tongue couldn't extend because of a tight frenulum causing her to suck extra hard. My nipples were bleeding by day 2, chapped and raw. Even air made them throb with pain. I got a consultant who let me know that she 100% had tongue tie. We ended up having to make a decision to get her tongue tie cut on week 2. It was either that or continue feeding her on my bleeding nipples, and hope for the best. The pain was so bad I was constantly sobbing while feeding my daughter. As soon as we had her tongue tie cut feeding was PAINLESS. I realized oh wow...so breastfeeding is actually not supposed to hurt. There were some people out there that made me feel terrible for cutting my daughters frenulum - but 6 months on and realizing how minor of a procedure it was for the trade off of painless breastfeeding...so so so worth it. Every mommy has to make their own choices that are best for their babies and themselves.",1,2

Zmi9iQp6944,You need to eat alot to be able to produce milk for breastfeeding. And alot of nourishing food that produces milk in your body. If they are not latching on you can pump it out for your baby. I had to eat twice as much to have milk for my baby. And in Asian cultures there are special food you need to eat to bring your body back all the nutrients you lose during birth.,0,0

U.S. hospitals are given additional funding if a mom EXCLUSIVELY breastfeeds,  and we also get ratings based on exclusive breastfeeding percentages.... thus, there is a huge pressure on us nurses to almost force breastfeeding on new moms. Your milk will come in! Don't give up, don't beat yourself up if it's not coming in quick enough... and if you need to supplement with formula.. it is OK!!",0,1

These blankets were to be handed down and treasured from Chief to successor. And it has survived the civil war, the Mexican American war, the Spanish American war, ww1 and WW2 in perfect condition.

fSkTpKa5gbo,"A good summary of some of the many issues with wind and solar energy:\\n\\nExtreme low EROI (Energy Return on Invested) of wind & solar. Ferroni found a full lifecyle EROI for Switzerland in Solar PV of 0.82:1, just a new-fangled way of burning fossil. You need an EROI of 14:1 to power a modern industrial civilization. \\n\\nExtreme seasonal variation of wind & solar. i.e. Britain, Germany, Canada, Russia many places 6:1 ratio summer: winter months. With energy demand max in winter. No known storage method to compensate for that.  As well as weekly and monthly variations, and wind & solar being typical minimum during cold winter spells when demand is max, wind typically is min during hot summer heat spells when demand is max, and all of wind, solar & hydro peak together in spring when demand is min. That is energy inefficiency on steroids. There is no storage available for those major fluctuations. And solar min during nighttime when EVs are charging. These vast wind & solar fluctuations mean one thing and one thing only, you guessed it burn more Fossil Fuels, fight more Oil Wars, Gas Pipeline Wars and Petrodollar Wars.\\n\\nHigh cost of wind & solar. Easily 2-10X the cost of factory built molten salt reactors. Not economically feasible. It would collapse our economy. Even the wealthiest nation in Europe, failed miserably, whereas France succeeded in 25 yrs with ancient one-at-a-time build nuclear.\\n\\nFact that wind & solar only replaces a bit of natural gas fuel worth 2 cents/kwh in USA & Canada. Does not replace any fossil infrastructure. In fact adds infrastructure (i.e. storage, long distance transmission, grid stability batteries).\\n\\nExtreme geographic unsuitability of wind & solar. Solar is pathetic in the north, rainy & cloudy areas, mountainous areas. Wind is pathetic in vast regions.\\n\\nExtreme land use of wind & solar, easily over 50X more than nuclear, many areas do not have sufficient underutilized land areas of that magnitude.\\n \\nExtreme transmission cost of wind & solar. Wind transmission must be oversized by ~3x, solar by 5-10X. More than 300km transmission costs as much as a NPP of similar size. \\n\\nNecessity for storage just to cover daily variation pushes solar & wind costs sky high, far above nuclear, and forces EROI so low it is really just another way to burn fossil. Storage for weekly, monthly and seasonal variation is unavailable. \\n\\nExtreme difficulty of wind & solar to supply the 85% of the world's energy supply that is thermal energy, hasn't even made a remote dent in that segment. \\nExtreme vulnerability of wind & solar to climate change, windy & sunny areas will shift causing extreme & disastrous changes in energy supply, which we are already seeing in hydro plants built where there was once plenty of rainfall, and now experiencing decades of drought. \\n\\nExtreme vulnerability of wind & solar to materials shortages. Solar uses 84X the material inputs per kwh as nuclear. Wind uses over 50X the steel & copper, 34X the concrete of current nuclear, much more than that for Molten Salt reactors. It is extremely dubious we will have sufficient copper & rare earth elements to supply what wind & solar would need. Add storage to the equation and there is no chance we will have the materials needed. And you still need to the vast materials to maintain a fossil fuel backup energy supply, all the supply chains going all the way to Middle East Oil fields and military protection.\\n\\nThe mammoth waste problem of wind and solar. Wind turbines only last 8-20yrs. Solar 10-25 yrs. A solar PV powered world would generate 63 thousand X the waste of a nuclear powered world. Even at 0.15% of world energy, solar PV is already causing huge piles of solar panels that we have no capability to dispose of or recycle properly. \\n\\nThe extreme difficulty of ramping up Wind & Solar. Note severe material requirements above. Nuclear build-rates have historically been minimum 4X faster than wind's maximum and 10X faster than Solar's fastest 4 year build rate period. In spite of the massive subsidies wind & solar have gotten compared to nuclear, per unit energy generated. That's just US federal and doesn't include all the state & local subsidies. And that's just one-at-time nuclear construction, not modern factory built molten salt reactors. After spending over $2 trillion, solar and wind are only up to 0.7% of world energy supply, with world energy increasing by 1%/yr and most of the current installed solar & wind will have to be replaced in the next 10-15yrs.\\n\\nTo add misery to madness all the wind or solar is doing is replacing a bit of natural gas fuel, worth 2 cents/kwh in the US, with cycling inefficiencies taken into account really only replacing 1.2-1.6 cents/kwh while they are paying 7.5 cents/kwh for this latest wind, not including large additional subsidies like 3X oversized transmission, grid stability batteries, curtailments, increased gas generation & supply costs, increased baseload generation costs, cycling fuel loss costs, low &  even negative pricing losses of surplus wind (power when you don‚Äôt want it), high price imports when wind is low (no power when you want it), increased gas heating costs and horrendously expensive energy storage costs. And with no fuel supply diversity, you are extraordinarily vulnerable to a natural gas supply shortage, vulnerable in both heat & electricity, a disaster waiting to happen.",0,0

fSkTpKa5gbo,"The best thing an average person can do to help advance this technology is to become an early adopter. If you buy solar panels, batteries, and an electric car, you are telling companies this is where the demand is. In a free market consumers vote on what the market should offer by purchasing products they want. So becoming an early adopter doesn't just make you green, it makes the entire market more green too.",0,2

fSkTpKa5gbo,"Batteries introduce new problems too. The scale of lithium mining would have to increase some 50x over and then after 10 years or so, all of those batteries need to be recycled, disposed of, or replaced, that creates a huge environmental concern and management problem.",2,1

fSkTpKa5gbo,"Batteries aren't benign. Nothing really is .... even photovoltaics.  The chemicals needed to make these things are a bit nasty. Silicon, lithium, different acids, many other chemicals including rare earth metals, are not easily recycled or disposed of, and aren't available in unlimited amounts.  Electricity has always been. difficult to store. \\nBut I guess this is a start. \\nAnd perhaps some one has new recipes for new batteries and capacitors.\\nRight now, the cheapest source of electricity is still efficiency improvements everywhere. \\nHard to get excited about that when private Airbus 380s are made, or when massive quantities of green house gases are released during the many wars around us. \\nBest Wishes to inventors everywhere.  And how much does Peace on Earth cost ?",2,1

It's a mark of an entire culture and people who saw these blankets as extremely important items holding spiritual significance to the Navajo as well as practical use for protecting against the deadly cold desert night time in the american Southwest. These blankets were to be handed down and treasured from Chief to successor. And it has survived the civil war, the Mexican American war, the Spanish American war, ww1 and WW2 in perfect condition. It's a beautiful blanket with the trademark Navajo design that tells the lincredible story of the Navajo people of America. They are extremely rare and very few ever survived.

fSkTpKa5gbo,"Solar and wind is a large improvement over burning Coal or Oil to make electricity.. but these and other existing 'green' techs are not in fact 'renewable energy'. These systems are energy extenders.. they take the energy from hydrocarbons (oil especially) and extend it employing wind or solar energy. As it is, oil only directly supplies about 6%? of the world's electricity (though everything is made from or with oil) so turning off all oil-fired plants won't mean much... The strategy presented here to simultaneously curtail the use of gas/oil in vehicles and introduce more 'renewable' power is good.. But the major source of energy for all these systems (extenders) is and will continue to be petroleum. And consider too that wind and solar farms are not 'eternal' but require constant maintenance and periodic replacement.. now batteries too? Also they do have their own negative environmental impacts as do and will the mineral extraction, transportation and manufacturing of massive new batteries and their sites and components.

fSkTpKa5gbo,Batteries are already changing our livelihoods. Imagine this; an EVs battery used to power a home for a couple days during a blackout. That's exactly what happened during the Florida storm recently.  Energy storage coupled with wind and solar is the way for a more sustainable future,0,0
fSkTpKa5gbo,@Bloomberg Hey what about Hydrogen for large storage capacity?,0,0
fSkTpKa5gbo,massive batteries production is the next ground pollution. Clean air against dirt soils. Mankind definitely don't get it. Key is sobriety. And you did'nt mention that we can store energy with hydrogen. That would be a better solution for wind and solar centrals.,0,0
fSkTpKa5gbo,"Lemming governments!\\nLook at some real numbers - a quote in response to the recent electric bus distance record:-\\n\\nEven in the tiny UK, a bus journey from London to Manchester is 200 miles. A loaded up bus with passengers wishing to use their laptops, enjoy ventilation with either air conditioning or warmth, know the driver can use lights to see the road, and have a bit of spare charge in case of delays, may need a range extender. And what kind of charging system can charge a bus like this ? 660 kWh takes 40 minutes to charge at 1 MW, or 3 hours 20 minutes at 200 kW, or 66 hours at 10 kW. So, maybe we have 12 buses in the garage just now, each wanting 400 kW, that‚Äôs 5 MW. Can somebody tell me if that is practical ? \\n\\nWhere are we going to find 1 MW charging points, or even 200 kW? And a cable to carry 5MW is going to be mighty hefty!\\nFar better to use the electricity to produce either liquid hydro-carbon fuel or hydrogen ‚Äì much easier to transport and re-fuel.",0,0

fSkTpKa5gbo,"As there is much talk about pumped hydro energy storage here, let me explain one thing. Pumped hydro storage is good at storing energy, but it's not good at releasing power fast. For my electricity market in germany, renewables have brought the price peaks down so low that energy arbitrage doesn't work, so Pumped hydro storage is not economic anymore. Batteries however can deliver power in milliseconds, so they are able to do frequency control, which gets you much more money than energy arbitrage.\\nAlso, it is a bit unfair to compare batteries and pumped hydro, batteries can be used anywhere, and pumped hydro just like hydro power needs the natural prerequisites like a river and a height difference. But to employ pumped hydro economically, there need to be price peaks for electricity.\\nJust like with renewables in general, a technology mix will likely be the best option for the future.

fSkTpKa5gbo,Why think of a battery conventionally? Others below have pointed out using excess energy to move air and water to their highest potential energy and convert that potential energy into kinetic energy later for use. Remember we are talking about a large excess of energy. To store that energy in a conventional chemical reaction cell is grossly inefficient it's more costly to run and produce. And I agree this video is very likely a product of Musk's propaganda machine. Remember how in an interview he favours Edison over Tesla. That says it all. We need another Nikola Tesla not another greedy business man like Edison.,0,0

fSkTpKa5gbo,"How about a solution that doesn't make generation of new energy barons? Storing excess energy as potential (gravitarional) energy is cheap and has minimal environmental impact. Simply use excess energy to pump water up into elevated reservoirs and release the water through hydroelectric damns when you want to access the energy during down time. Simple, water is every where, we know how to make reservoirs and damns. We can even figure out how to do this in places where water is scarce and prevent evaporation.

fSkTpKa5gbo,"The one problem I can see with this is that demand might outpace supply stalling the reduction in cost for batteries at least for a while, possibly even raising the price again. If batteries hit a critical price point to make them competitive in the energy storage market, all of a sudden there will be a huge demand for those batteries. That could be bad for electric cars. Then again I could be wrong and companies might be able to meet the demand very quickly, but it looks to me like those giga factories take quite a while to build.

They would rather we pretended to be happy so as not to upset THEIR comfortable existences. But I think we yearn for that kind of honesty about our feelings, and I think there's a strength and wisdom toward resisting the urge to get angry. Not that anger is always bad.

Easier said than done. \\n\\nIt's weird. I was just at the Vatican in Rome last week. (Nothing fancy, I was just on a short vacation on my own till I met up with a friend) I was waiting in line to pay for a ticket to go up the stairs of St. Peter's Basilica. A young couple was pleading for an exchange of cash of US dollars to Euros. They had no cash to pay for the tickets. No one was helping them/ or I was the only American in line that would care for dollars (we will never know). I offered to help and they were very grateful. I thought nothing of it after continuing in the line to go up the steps. The young boy went to the head of the line (where I was) and thanked me again and again. He was so relieved. \\n\\nI still regret it. I wanted to be vulnerable and say We are the Vatican, whether you believe in this religion that created this beauty or not... why wouldn't I help... It's not only the religious thing to do, it's the human thing do. Instead I humbly and sheepishly said Oh, it's nothing. It's not a problem.  It's really wasn't a problem, but I still regret not saying what I really felt. I didn't want to feel vulnerable with my intrinsic values in the middle of a Roman tourist attraction. I guess my greater message was that love and compassion made me do it, not only a fear of God or those kind of negative religious associations. It's odd because I felt compelled to tell this to him. I really thought I was crazy. People don't talk like that I thought... I guess I was scared of his rejection of my personal values. I feared his projections of my honest intentions. Even if his gratitude turned to disgust due my reference to a religion, I should have been strong enough to take any reaction, because I was being open and aiming for genuine care for the other. \\n\\nI wasn't vulnerable, because I felt ashamed. Looking back, why feel\\nashamed with being kind - no matter the source, rationality or irrationality of that action.\\n\\nIt was one of my favorite moments of the trip. I fell short with this, but I challenge myself to do better as a human being with a soul that is longing to express and connect meaningfully with others- whether at the front of a Walgreens or the front of a majestic Roman church.",0,0

PJsJ96yyVk8,"I'm not the most succinct person but my take on the message is vulnerability = humanness ---> oneness, the unmasking of our fronts or differences ---> true connection + less loneliness, thus sincere love and joy. \\n\\nMy algorithm on happiness. Easier said than done. \\n\\nIt's weird. I was just at the Vatican in Rome last week. (Nothing fancy, I was just on a short vacation on my own till I met up with a friend) I was waiting in line to pay for a ticket to go up the stairs of St. Peter's Basilica. A young couple was pleading for an exchange of cash of US dollars to Euros. They had no cash to pay for the tickets. No one was helping them/ or I was the only American in line that would care for dollars (we will never know). I offered to help and they were very grateful. I thought nothing of it after continuing in the line to go up the steps. The young boy went to the head of the line (where I was) and thanked me again and again. He was so relieved. \\n\\nI still regret it. I wanted to be vulnerable and say We are the Vatican, whether you believe in this religion that created this beauty or not... why wouldn't I help... It's not only the religious thing to do, it's the human thing do. Instead I humbly and sheepishly said Oh, it's nothing. It's not a problem.  It's really wasn't a problem, but I still regret not saying what I really felt. I didn't want to feel vulnerable with my intrinsic values in the middle of a Roman tourist attraction. I guess my greater message was that love and compassion made me do it, not only a fear of God or those kind of negative religious associations. It's odd because I felt compelled to tell this to him. I really thought I was crazy. People don't talk like that I thought... I guess I was scared of his rejection of my personal values. I feared his projections of my honest intentions. Even if his gratitude turned to disgust due my reference to a religion, I should have been strong enough to take any reaction, because I was being open and aiming for genuine care for the other. \\n\\nI wasn't vulnerable, because I felt ashamed. Looking back, why feel\\nashamed with being kind - no matter the source, rationality or irrationality of that action.\\n\\nIt was one of my favorite moments of the trip. I fell short with this, but I challenge myself to do better as a human being with a soul that is longing to express and connect meaningfully with others- whether at the front of a Walgreens or the front of a majestic Roman church.",0,0

PJsJ96yyVk8,Showing vulnerability can vary on how people react. Some people will find a way to belittle you and want to have the upperhand and will use this against you.

However, I eventually discovered some ways to coax it out of them, one of which was to intentionally do something embarrassing. I also found a good way was to pay them a compliment, anything that brought yourself down a level, or caused them to feel brought up a level. it eventually became apparent that the statistic was close to accurate. I could also tell who was likely to speak English by looking at them, and judging by their age, and how they dress. I know that sounds superficial, but it had close to 100% reliability.",1,0

PJsJ96yyVk8,"I hate to generalize, but it seems like in our society, the more appropriate response to bad things happening is anger. To many, it seems, anger denotes strength, the sense that I won't let people walk all over me. If we respond with sadness or melancholy, which is healthier I think, people tend to look down on us, label us as a Debbie Downer or a Sad Sack. They would rather we pretended to be happy so as not to upset THEIR comfortable existences. But I think we yearn for that kind of honesty about our feelings, and I think there's a strength and wisdom toward resisting the urge to get angry. Not that anger is always bad. It just seems we tend to see it as valuable, whereas sadness is something to cover up or cure. Am I way off base?",1,1

L00YWl8StuI,"Wrong and biased on so many level. 1. You apparently don't know what speed is, which you mentioned what rogue character is for. Speed is pound for pound strength and endurance of the body. Men are stronger and more durable pound for pound than women. Rogue vs warrior is something to be compared among different species, not men and women. 2. Strength and size is not everything. Muscular complexity matters as well. I honestly don't know if the difference exists between men and women, but such thing exists between races and between humans and chimpanzees. \\n\\nAlso, careful when you mention the waist size difference between men and women. All the Buddhas out there are going to think they are alpha males. Thick waist is something to be ashamed of for both men and women. \\n\\nFYI (that average is the American average, not world average). \\n\\nAlso, there are only two genders. There are varying degrees of masculinity and femininity, but there are only two genders (go learn some biology. You'll learn about asexual reproduction and sexual reproduction). Also, masculinity can only be compared within the specie (you cannot compare the level of concentration of testosterone in a tiger and in an elephant; size does not tell you much in that perspective). IMO, aggressiveness is a choice, not a binding reaction of hormone. In nature, such aggressiveness resulting from high testosterone is easily projected because otherwise, such trait will go to a waste. Such thing is simply not true for complex human society. In other words, animals with high testosterone is aggressive because they have privilege to do so from higher physical prowess they gain from higher testosterone.",2,0

PJsJ96yyVk8,"I'm not the most succinct person but my take on the message is vulnerability = humanness ---> oneness, the unmasking of our fronts or differences ---> true connection + less loneliness, thus sincere love and joy. \\n\\nMy algorithm on happiness. Easier said than done. \\n\\nIt's weird. I was just at the Vatican in Rome last week. (Nothing fancy, I was just on a short vacation on my own till I met up with a friend) I was waiting in line to pay for a ticket to go up the stairs of St. Peter's Basilica. A young couple was pleading for an exchange of cash of US dollars to Euros. They had no cash to pay for the tickets. No one was helping them/ or I was the only American in line that would care for dollars (we will never know). I offered to help and they were very grateful. I thought nothing of it after continuing in the line to go up the steps. The young boy went to the head of the line (where I was) and thanked me again and again. He was so relieved. \\n\\nI still regret it. I wanted to be vulnerable and say We are the Vatican, whether you believe in this religion that created this beauty or not... why wouldn't I help... It's not only the religious thing to do, it's the human thing do. Instead I humbly and sheepishly said Oh, it's nothing. It's not a problem.  It's really wasn't a problem, but I still regret not saying what I really felt. I didn't want to feel vulnerable with my intrinsic values in the middle of a Roman tourist attraction. I guess my greater message was that love and compassion made me do it, not only a fear of God or those kind of negative religious associations. It's odd because I felt compelled to tell this to him. I really thought I was crazy. People don't talk like that I thought... I guess I was scared of his rejection of my personal values. I feared his projections of my honest intentions. Even if his gratitude turned to disgust due my reference to a religion, I should have been strong enough to take any reaction, because I was being open and aiming for genuine care for the other. \\n\\nI wasn't vulnerable, because I felt ashamed. Looking back, why feel\\nashamed with being kind - no matter the source, rationality or irrationality of that action.\\n\\nIt was one of my favorite moments of the trip. I fell short with this, but I challenge myself to do better as a human being with a soul that is longing to express and connect meaningfully with others- whether at the front of a Walgreens or the front of a majestic Roman church.",0,0

PJsJ96yyVk8,Showing vulnerability can vary on how people react. Some people will find a way to belittle you and want to have the upperhand and will use this against you. Others will be more accepting of it and feel a connection with you because they too make mistakes. Show a bit of vulnerability and take a step back and see how the other person reacts..,0,0

However, I eventually discovered some ways to coax it out of them, one of which was to intentionally do something embarrassing. I also found a good way was to pay them a compliment, anything that brought yourself down a level, or caused them to feel brought up a level. it eventually became apparent that the statistic was close to accurate.

PJsJ96yyVk8,"I hate to generalize, but it seems like in our society, the more appropriate response to bad things happening is anger. To many, it seems, anger denotes strength, the sense that I won't let people walk all over me. If we respond with sadness or melancholy, which is healthier I think, people tend to look down on us, label us as a Debbie Downer or a Sad Sack. They would rather we pretended to be happy so as not to upset THEIR comfortable existences. But I think we yearn for that kind of honesty about our feelings, and I think there's a strength and wisdom toward resisting the urge to get angry. Not that anger is always bad. It just seems we tend to see it as valuable, whereas sadness is something to cover up or cure. Am I way off base?",1,1

The ones about strength, height, and intelligence. Those are all fine. If you don't like the ones you have, fix them (Except those you can't fix like height). Lose weight, get smarter, etc. No one is stopping you. I'm not fine with ones like, all women, make less than men! It's not true, and you aren't special if you make more than your husband. Those norms are based on theory's that haven't been properly tested. They are not based on absolute fact. The wage gap is based off of an overall study where the income of every person from the different sexes was put together. They didn't bother to check that their were more male scientists and more female gardeners. They just shoved them all together and found out that scientists and doctors make more than gardeners and artists. Not men in the same job as women make more than them.",4,3

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

PJsJ96yyVk8,hA well I'm invulnerable how about that,0,0
PJsJ96yyVk8,"1.   The only way we can truly connect with someone is by taking risks . If a friend tells me that he has trouble sleeping, I can tell him that for the longest time I was having nightmares almost every night , it got a bit better, but that's how I know what insomnia means. Well, then he may think that I must be a real weirdo.  But he may also take it as an invitation for us to engage in a real conversation where we could go deeper into the subject. \\n\\nDeeper often means darker and more complex. But still, because you two make the effort to get there together, in that moment you are really LIVING through something. That's what feeling connected means. \\n\\nNo matter how sad the subject is, you will come out of such a conversation with a sense of serenity and it  will be a  good memory because you have truly shared something. \\n\\nI love this quote by Theodore Zeldin: \\n\\n The kind of conversation I am interested in is one which you start with a willingness to emerge a slightly different person. It is always an experiment, whose results are never guaranteed. It involves risk. It 's an adventure in which we agree to cook the world together and make it taste less bitter. \\n\\n\\n2. We usually try to impress the other, in the hope of being loved . But indeed boasting about yourself is not being impressive, it is being intimidating. We all have our strengths and weaknesses. Something that came to you very easily in life can be incredibly difficult to reach for another person. So by pointing THAT out, you are emphasising what  separates you from that person. \\nWhat is the sense of this??\\n\\n\\n3. There is a wonderful, wonderful tale  by Oscar Wilde called  The Remarkable Rocket. You can read the tale or watch the animation . It is on you tube. Well, in fact, the most remarkable thing about that rocket is that the more it boasts, the more it sinks into the mud!\\n\\nComedian Sarah Jones uses a wonderful term, describing the darker side of the social media, forcing us to show a happy face all the time. She says it is a culture of  compare and despair. \\n\\nIf you want to think more about this,  there is an episode of the excellent podcast Hidden Brain, called  Schadenfacebook. \\n\\n4. This video does not suggest that we must always talk about our problems. Being a  me, me, me type of person is really something else. \\n\\n  It is another thing to dare to open up about the challenges you are facing right now, hoping that the other person could also learn something from what you are going through. Because indeed, anything can happen to any of us anytime. \\n\\nI guess it was Seneca who said that a ship may also sink at the port.. \\n\\n5. And don't miss the wonderful TED Talk   The Power of Vulnerability by Brene Brown. Her book on the subject,  Daring Greatly is also very helpful. \\n \\nThanks a lot for this very valuable lesson. I loved the animation too.",0,0

There's something so uplifting, and quasi-spiritual about that music (especially if you're a worker, like me). It's country, it could be said to have blues influences. That, and the international socialist anthem. But that last one is qualitatively different. How?",0,0

PJsJ96yyVk8,"I'm not the most succinct person but my take on the message is vulnerability = humanness ---> oneness, the unmasking of our fronts or differences ---> true connection + less loneliness, thus sincere love and joy. \\n\\nMy algorithm on happiness. Easier said than done. \\n\\nIt's weird. I was just at the Vatican in Rome last week. (Nothing fancy, I was just on a short vacation on my own till I met up with a friend) I was waiting in line to pay for a ticket to go up the stairs of St. Peter's Basilica. A young couple was pleading for an exchange of cash of US dollars to Euros. They had no cash to pay for the tickets. No one was helping them/ or I was the only American in line that would care for dollars (we will never know). I offered to help and they were very grateful. I thought nothing of it after continuing in the line to go up the steps. The young boy went to the head of the line (where I was) and thanked me again and again. He was so relieved. \\n\\nI still regret it. I wanted to be vulnerable and say We are the Vatican, whether you believe in this religion that created this beauty or not... why wouldn't I help... It's not only the religious thing to do, it's the human thing do. Instead I humbly and sheepishly said Oh, it's nothing. It's not a problem.  It's really wasn't a problem, but I still regret not saying what I really felt. I didn't want to feel vulnerable with my intrinsic values in the middle of a Roman tourist attraction. I guess my greater message was that love and compassion made me do it, not only a fear of God or those kind of negative religious associations. It's odd because I felt compelled to tell this to him. I really thought I was crazy. People don't talk like that I thought... I guess I was scared of his rejection of my personal values. I feared his projections of my honest intentions. Even if his gratitude turned to disgust due my reference to a religion, I should have been strong enough to take any reaction, because I was being open and aiming for genuine care for the other. \\n\\nI wasn't vulnerable, because I felt ashamed. Looking back, why feel\\nashamed with being kind - no matter the source, rationality or irrationality of that action.\\n\\nIt was one of my favorite moments of the trip. I fell short with this, but I challenge myself to do better as a human being with a soul that is longing to express and connect meaningfully with others- whether at the front of a Walgreens or the front of a majestic Roman church.",0,0
PJsJ96yyVk8,I like your thumb people,0,0
PJsJ96yyVk8,Showing vulnerability can vary on how people react. Some people will find a way to belittle you and want to have the upperhand and will use this against you. Others will be more accepting of it and feel a connection with you because they too make mistakes. Show a bit of vulnerability and take a step back and see how the other person reacts..,0,0

PJsJ96yyVk8,"I'm a very different person from who I was five years ago. A better person. I was scared of vulnerability before. I felt as though I was placing my emotional stability and happiness in the hands of others by being vulnerable. These days, I've found that I feel more in control of my life and my emotions than I ever have, and I believe it's largely due to my willingness to be vulnerable; my ability to be honest with others, and honest with myself, about who I am and how I feel.

Statistics would have you believe that a third of people spoke English, and at first I didn't believes that, because they wouldn't talk to you because they were afraid of making a mistake or not speaking English very well. However, I eventually discovered some ways to coax it out of them, one of which was to intentionally do something embarrassing. I also found a good way was to pay them a compliment, anything that brought yourself down a level, or caused them to feel brought up a level. it eventually became apparent that the statistic was close to accurate. I could also tell who was likely to speak English by looking at them, and judging by their age, and how they dress. I know that sounds superficial, but it had close to 100% reliability.",1,0

PJsJ96yyVk8,"I hate to generalize, but it seems like in our society, the more appropriate response to bad things happening is anger. To many, it seems, anger denotes strength, the sense that I won't let people walk all over me. If we respond with sadness or melancholy, which is healthier I think, people tend to look down on us, label us as a Debbie Downer or a Sad Sack. They would rather we pretended to be happy so as not to upset THEIR comfortable existences. But I think we yearn for that kind of honesty about our feelings, and I think there's a strength and wisdom toward resisting the urge to get angry. Not that anger is always bad. It just seems we tend to see it as valuable, whereas sadness is something to cover up or cure. Am I way off base?",2,2

The wage gap is based off of an overall study where the income of every person from the different sexes was put together.

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens.

The good news is that it benefits society and infrastructure, bad news is that we're overpaying.\\nAlso other items like losses/business failures, you get a tax deduction. The government wouldn't take their time to find out how much you can pay less.\\nThe IRS audits 2% of the 300 million population every year. We all play the IRS lottery to not get picked. \\nWhen someone's tax form gets picked and is incorrect, IRS resubmits the form as quickly as possible (without any tax benefits). \\nOne of the problems they check is the income.

zV0dpCG-8go,"Honestly I always thought it was for independent validation but the fact that there is fines and possibly jail time involved if you get it wrong is absurd. \\n\\nIn the past I've used independent validation tactics to determine mathematical errors in complex systems. The idea being a couple of people and myself take a definition of what should be in the blank, with the blank being a math equation that fits with many other math equations. We each come up with our equations without looking at each other's work and then present it to each other after we are all done. Ideally what we should have at the end of that exercise is essentially the same equation allowing for some simplifications each individual notices are possible. In reality however we each have our own version which produces slightly different output and then study why each of us come to the conclusions we did. Once that step is done we then approach solving it as a group using what we all learned and as a result the math becomes so reliably accurate to the problem that there is little to no room left for improvement. \\n\\nIn the cases of solving tax amounts that process would mean little to no room for error but that cross evaluation step is called auditing and too many people fear it. There's no reason to fear it, while they auditor shows up to determine whether or not your wrong, you can also determine whether or not they are wrong. For all you know they missed something in their solution that could save you some money on your taxes so it's in your best interest to take part and make sure their side of it is accurate.",0,0

LDXr12ToYuM,"I know it's just coincidence, but I laughed when I saw you published this the same day as my 18th birthday. I've been told that I'm an adult now, and it's a whole new stage of my life, and time to change and learn new stuff, and all that. I've been pulling away from everyone around me for a long time, but then, when I got so many birthday wishes from these people I've met recently or from people I thought forgot about me months ago it hit me that I wasn't as alone as I thought and I was more blessed then I had previously acknowledged. Like a lot people who've watched this, I could relate to a lot of what you were saying, and your video came at the perfect time, when I'm still willing to try to listen to others and open up. I think i can learn a lot and improve my life from applying what you talked about and I am going to try to.

And no one seems to care, no one seems to even notice. Even the people that have been on the phone at 2 a.m with me sobbing on the other line, don't seem to care. I ask for help and they say, I'm disappointed in you and I almost don't wanna fight anymore.

But when i ask what i can do she says nothing. She surrounds herself in all this pain and suffering and does nothing to fix it. All i can do is support her but i know that if she doesn't want help from others, she needs to help herself. She'll come to my house with scars on her wrists, and she'll admit that she wasn't okay the night before, and i always ask why didn't you call me? And she'd say I didn't want to wake you its so upsetting how people who are hurt and feel so alone find themselves believing the voices in their heads, believing their truly alone, when their friends are just one phone call away. If you are feeling depressed and worthless, the best thing you can do is talk to someone, not even talk about your problems, just talk to someone so that you won't feel less alone.",0,0

LDXr12ToYuM,"So I just want to say that I followed gabby from the begging since vine and through her transition in to YouTube and I always loved her content until she started posting and uploading things that did not fit with what she normally would post. I thought to myself okay people change and even though I saw this person grow not just in viewers or followers but you know spiritually and emotionally, but her content is something that I no longer am interested in watching or spending time consuming. Yes that sounds harsh but I am just being blunt. My little sister started not too long ago to watch her after seeing her in another YouTuber's video and it caught my interest and I think she said this in one of her other videos but I agree with that person who said it. I truly enjoy watching her videos now, and not to be relatable but her perspective on life and self growth has changed and I am now proud of the example she is setting mental health wise for young viewers everywhere, including my sister so keep it up Gaby and I hope the best for you emotionally spiritually financially and of course health wise stay strong and never give up on your dreams because as you have seen you have been seeing them come true before your eyes. That is not always going to be easy and sometimes you might doubt your judgement but always go with what your gutt is telling you and you will get very far",2,0
LDXr12ToYuM,I have a motto and it also makes me laugh. \nAss\n\nA-always\nS-stay\nS-strong \nAnd I can be not ok as well a lot of the time and I still don't really open up.But I say this to myself an have a giggle but tbh it doesn't make me feel that better if anything it's probably a fake laugh but it's something to remember. And if there's anyone out there that's like me or Gabbie  then Ass üòÇ but on a serious note thank you Gabbie your such an inspiration and I'm not going to be the only person that you made come to a realisation thank you. And I don't even think you'll see this Gab but to anyone out there that is feeling the same and is just reading the comments praying they aren't the only ones remember your not alone. Xxx,0,0

You have to work fast(er) because it dries easily and it wipes itself off once you go back, but you'll get better at it each time. LOVE IT. At night I take my make-up off with oil first - so this comes off as well - but it is so worth it. It stays put all-day-long, rain or shine!!! Excellent for the beach and/or if you want no other make-up, just to frame your face while at home. I even get compliments now on my brows, never have I ever gotten any. I have the Blond one and use it very gently (soft colour indeed) with a guide. Superb! Haven't used anything else, since I ordered this. The fact that you can trust it, is priceless. xxx",1,0

The government wouldn't take their time to find out how much you can pay less.\\nThe IRS audits 2% of the 300 million population every year. We all play the IRS lottery to not get picked. \\nWhen someone's tax form gets picked and is incorrect, IRS resubmits the form as quickly as possible (without any tax benefits). \\nOne of the problems they check is the income.

zV0dpCG-8go,"Honestly I always thought it was for independent validation but the fact that there is fines and possibly jail time involved if you get it wrong is absurd. \\n\\nIn the past I've used independent validation tactics to determine mathematical errors in complex systems. The idea being a couple of people and myself take a definition of what should be in the blank, with the blank being a math equation that fits with many other math equations. We each come up with our equations without looking at each other's work and then present it to each other after we are all done. Ideally what we should have at the end of that exercise is essentially the same equation allowing for some simplifications each individual notices are possible. In reality however we each have our own version which produces slightly different output and then study why each of us come to the conclusions we did. Once that step is done we then approach solving it as a group using what we all learned and as a result the math becomes so reliably accurate to the problem that there is little to no room left for improvement. \\n\\nIn the cases of solving tax amounts that process would mean little to no room for error but that cross evaluation step is called auditing and too many people fear it. There's no reason to fear it, while they auditor shows up to determine whether or not your wrong, you can also determine whether or not they are wrong. For all you know they missed something in their solution that could save you some money on your taxes so it's in your best interest to take part and make sure their side of it is accurate.",0,0

The only complaint I would have is to not do what you guys did with It Comes At Night for any of your movies ever again.

I always seem to attract selfish people with narcissistic tendencies. and ive  suffered in silence my entire life. My family is verbally and physically abusive (not much physical anymore now that i'm a legal adult)  My friends always seemed to get their benefits off of me. The come in battered and leave all charged p with a big ego and self esteem. It make me happy to see them happy but always its at the cost of my own happiness, physical n mental health,  and self esteem. 19 years of suffering in silence and i see no chance of it changing. I like being alone because i don't get drained, I don't get social anxiety of things that could happen or its just me being irrational . but in the end my gut proves right and my anxieties seem valid. so what to trust.

LDXr12ToYuM,"Thank you! I thought I was alone, crying myself to sleep every night. I can't even sleep it's sad. I try to go to school with a smile but with every smile I just want to cry cause NO ONE knows the real me. No one understands me. And the one person who I thought apparently didn't cause she spread rumors about me around the school. I try to hang out with my friends but I just stand there listening but not really. And like you said no one noticed. I don't know what to do with my sleep anymore. And I'm not okay. People always ask me and I just say yes because no one wants to listen to this emo girls crap and I want to pour out to them and want to talk say no but no one would be there with a tissue or a shoulder. I try to make friends but I push them all away because I'm not that person. I'm not who they think I am. They think they know me but they don't. They think I'm a happy girl but I'm not, I'm someone who wants to stay in her room all weekend and be alone and cry myself asleep. And I know I'm pouring out my feeling now but that's because I can't to someone I can physically see.",0,0

I'm broken and I can't do anything about it because as much as people say that they are depressed why act so happy and be so genuinely happy. The face I put on all day is a fake smile. I have one person that I've opened up to. She can't relate to everything but it helps. As much as I think she hates me right now It helps.

Mw5T62dJzhQ,"Overnight I became a sun-worshipper. Well, not overnight, you can't see the sun at night. But first thing the next morning, I became a sun-worshipper. Several reasons. First of all, I can see the sun, okay? Unlike some other gods I could mention, I can actually see the sun. I'm big on that. If I can see something, I don't know, it kind of helps the credibility along, you know? So everyday I can see the sun, as it gives me everything I need; heat, light, food, flowers in the park, reflections on the lake, an occasional skin cancer, but hey. At least there are no crucifixions, and we're not setting people on fire simply because they don't agree with us.\\n \\nSun worship is fairly simple. There's no mystery, no miracles, no pageantry, no one asks for money, there are no songs to learn, and we don't have a special building where we all gather once a week to compare clothing. And the best thing about the sun, it never tells me I'm unworthy. Doesn't tell me I'm a bad person who needs to be saved. Hasn't said an unkind word. Treats me fine. So, I worship the sun. But, I don't pray to the sun. Know why? I wouldn't presume on our friendship. It's not polite. \\n\\n- G. Carlin",0,0

Mw5T62dJzhQ,"Bullshit. Why would ancient man make such immense structures to 'keep track of time and the seasons' when all they had to do is look at the flora and fauna around them to easily tell when the seasons where changing, which they had to do anyway just to survive as hunger-gatherers. They were far more intricately connected to the seasons and biorhythm of the earth than we are; the modern mainstream archeological opinions on these kinds of structures is utterly devoid of logic. My wife is an archeologist and has been trying to fight the established status quo for years, which is to say that modern archeology doesn't formulate their theories from the evidence, rather, they have a theory before the evidence is gone through and any evidence that contradicts their theory is generally disregarded. This is even the case in paleontology, where the desire to name something or be 'the discoverer' has caused the dinosaur bones of young, juvenile, and then adult species of the same type, possibly even from the same family unit in cases where the remains were found right next to each other, be classified and named as completely separate species for over 100 years, only now being realized as bogus.

This means that Facebook's valuation isn't based on its current financial standing, but on what it's expected to be in years to come,which although it seems like sound investing,I see it as a little troubling.Facebook would need a 1731.3% increase in its revenues to simply match Wal-Mart's performance (And if it ever does its market valuation will be at One gazillion dollars).\\nInternet stocks are notoriously known for being overvalued and for generating little profit.\\nI wouldn't invest a dime on any established internet company, bubbles seems always immanent, because it's genuinely hard to separate genuine businesses and not let yourself be caught by the hype created by the market.",0,0

This video is doing the rounds on numerous channels and they are all doing the same thing, just showing the video and getting viewers to make their own opinions on what they are seeing which are mostly negative against the parents of the child because of the inappropriate behaviour of taking someone else's popcorn without their consent.\\n\\nWhat this channel and many others who are showing the same video are deliberately doing in the hope of getting negative responses towards the parents, is not informing the viewers that the little girl and the parents are well known to the Prince, they are very good friends. The little girl is the daughter of a double amputee who has completed in previous Invictus Games. \\n\\nIf viewers knew in advance that the little girl and her parents are good friends of Prince Harry, it would then alter their opinions on what they are seeing, for the positive but in my opinion this does not sit with the narrative that this channel owner wants, hence the omission that they are all good friends and have known each other for some time.",0,0

T58NGMrUp0M,"This video naturally overlooks a lot of history in order to keep the video relatively short.  For example, people often claim that landline phone service was a natural monopoly, because how efficient would it have been to run multiple, competing phone lines?  While that certainly pointed to a difficulty early phone companies had, it doesn't really make it a natural monopoly,  Instead, the companies were working out agreements to share the phone lines, so that multiple lines weren't necessary.  Bell Telephone, however, successfully argued the natural monopoly argument to local legislators, and got them to grant local monopolies to phone companies, and Bell, being the biggest phone company at the time, was well-positioned to receive most of those government-granted monopolies.\\n\\nAnd, in fact, national telecommunications in the U.S. was nationalized, if only briefly:\\n\\nIn 1918 the federal government nationalized the entire telecommunications industry, with national security as the stated intent. Rates were regulated so that customers in large cities would pay higher rates to subsidize those in more remote areas. Vail was appointed to manage the telephone system with AT&T being paid a percentage of the telephone revenues. AT&T profited well from the nationalization arrangement which ended a year later. States then began regulating rates so that those in rural areas would not have to pay high prices, and competition was highly regulated or prohibited in local markets. Also, potential competitors were forbidden from installing new lines to compete, with state governments wishing to avoid duplication. The claim was that telephone service was a natural monopoly, meaning that one firm could better serve the public than two or more. Eventually, AT&T's market share amounted to what most would regard as a monopolistic share.\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_AT%26T\\n\\nThe history of phone service in the U.S. would have been very different if government intervention hadn't occurred.",1,0

T58NGMrUp0M,"Apart from the third party operators out there, one familiar to those my age is GTE (General Telephone), whose service differed greatly from Bell/AT&T as they had to have their own phones and wires.  Don't forget before 1984, Bell was the only company to manufacture their own phones that customers could only pay to have installed in their homes.  You just don't go out and buy an extra phone as it didn't work that way.  That all changed after the breakup and we started to see a lot of cheaply-produced phones out on the market.  Bell System phones (made by Western Electric) were heavy and practically unbreakable like tanks. \\n\\nGetting back to GTE, they mostly serviced specific areas Bell wasn't it, usually rural/suburban.  My grandma had GTE where she was and I can remember the odd noise the dialer made and the rings itself.  I'm sure this all had to do with those  specific patents AT&T had.\\n\\nIt should be noted, outside of DirecTV, AT&T also has it's own broadband service including DSL and a cable TV service called U-Verse in a number of markets they do operate landline phone service in (like the former Ohio Bell in my state).",1,0

LDXr12ToYuM,"The Gabbie Show, thank you so much for your videos. I am so inspired by your strength everyday you inspire me in so many ways. I  going through so much in my life right now a secret battle I have been fighting for so long but, you show me that there is hope out there for me, you are teaching me how to be strong even thought it is so hard to be strong when pressure sounds me/us. I Here is a little about me and what I live with every single day. I myself suffer from depression and to me it is much like that I am living in a prison that I cannot escape. I for so long have lived in a silent fear so as stupid as all this sounds I in a way created my own little so-called perfect world to be honest it is not perfect I am not perfect I created it because I thought if I just go to that so-called happy place than all of my silent fears would just fade away, I created this fake world of my own because I have always been afraid to speak out about all that has been trouble-ing me my entire life. I suffered and still suffer a lot of rejection and feel so unloved/unloveable like who would ever want to love me,  this sounds so stupid and lame but I feel the pain and it is so strong and this silence I've been living in my entire life is so loud and I need somebody, anybody who would just stop and listen to me to know that I AM NOT OKAY,  and that I am hurting really bad and that I am aching really bad and that I can't take it anymore. I have suffered for so long with thoughts of giving up on everything on life because I feel like if maybe just if I wasn't around than nobody would even notice because I feel so invisible to everyone anyways so why or how would anybody notice my absence if they didn't even notice my presence in the first place. I am a lost girl just trying to find her way through this sea of confusion this ocean of misery I've been drowning in for so long. One thing that i know for sure is that sometime you don't know how strong you are until being strong is the only choice that you have, and if being strong is the only choice that you have then you will do anything and everything that you can do keep going to survive, this goes for everyone including me,  and the fact that I am writing this to you shows me that I am strong and courageous and beautiful even though I suffer from a lot I mean A LOT of insecurity and it is so hard to believe this myself but it is true, and Gabbie I want you to know that you are beautiful too!!!. I do hope that anybody else out there going through what I am going through or similar that you are okay and that you know you are loved.",0,0

LDXr12ToYuM,I just want to say something ( disclaimer I'm straight) I truly do not understand how you are single. Honestly your personality is so strong and kind and sweet and caring and pH my gosh seriously I can't even explain it.

I think they are jealous honestly anyway I just want you to know that you are beautiful and worth everything and so is everyone reading this comment \nThe right person will always come along and the resonance you are ever single is because it is mentioned to be that way in that time and it will benefit you somehow remember to be strong and yourself all the time,0,0

Mw5T62dJzhQ,"Overnight I became a sun-worshipper. Well, not overnight, you can't see the sun at night. But first thing the next morning, I became a sun-worshipper. Several reasons. First of all, I can see the sun, okay? Unlike some other gods I could mention, I can actually see the sun. I'm big on that. If I can see something, I don't know, it kind of helps the credibility along, you know? So everyday I can see the sun, as it gives me everything I need; heat, light, food, flowers in the park, reflections on the lake, an occasional skin cancer, but hey. At least there are no crucifixions, and we're not setting people on fire simply because they don't agree with us.\\n \\nSun worship is fairly simple. There's no mystery, no miracles, no pageantry, no one asks for money, there are no songs to learn, and we don't have a special building where we all gather once a week to compare clothing. And the best thing about the sun, it never tells me I'm unworthy. Doesn't tell me I'm a bad person who needs to be saved. Hasn't said an unkind word. Treats me fine. So, I worship the sun. But, I don't pray to the sun. Know why? I wouldn't presume on our friendship. It's not polite. \\n\\n- G. Carlin",0,0

This video is doing the rounds on numerous channels and they are all doing the same thing, just showing the video and getting viewers to make their own opinions on what they are seeing which are mostly negative against the parents of the child because of the inappropriate behaviour of taking someone else's popcorn without their consent.\\n\\nWhat this channel and many others who are showing the same video are deliberately doing in the hope of getting negative responses towards the parents, is not informing the viewers that the little girl and the parents are well known to the Prince, they are very good friends. The little girl is the daughter of a double amputee who has completed in previous Invictus Games. \\n\\nIf viewers knew in advance that the little girl and her parents are good friends of Prince Harry, it would then alter their opinions on what they are seeing, for the positive but in my opinion this does not sit with the narrative that this channel owner wants, hence the omission that they are all good friends and have known each other for some time.",0,0

I would trace its demise to the MCI worldcom multi-year illegality of stating false profits which real companies could not compete with.  Also a failure for the federal government to enforce the telecommunications completion act.  In the end the Internet bubble busted and the most unimaginative and backward baby bell, SBC, had the cash on hand to buy the name and what was left.",7,0

T58NGMrUp0M,"Apart from the third party operators out there, one familiar to those my age is GTE (General Telephone), whose service differed greatly from Bell/AT&T as they had to have their own phones and wires.  Don't forget before 1984, Bell was the only company to manufacture their own phones that customers could only pay to have installed in their homes.  You just don't go out and buy an extra phone as it didn't work that way.  That all changed after the breakup and we started to see a lot of cheaply-produced phones out on the market.  Bell System phones (made by Western Electric) were heavy and practically unbreakable like tanks. \\n\\nGetting back to GTE, they mostly serviced specific areas Bell wasn't it, usually rural/suburban.  My grandma had GTE where she was and I can remember the odd noise the dialer made and the rings itself.  I'm sure this all had to do with those  specific patents AT&T had.\\n\\nIt should be noted, outside of DirecTV, AT&T also has it's own broadband service including DSL and a cable TV service called U-Verse in a number of markets they do operate landline phone service in (like the former Ohio Bell in my state).",1,0

T58NGMrUp0M,Can You Do Nickelodeon Or Cartoon Network?,3,2
T58NGMrUp0M,"This video naturally overlooks a lot of history in order to keep the video relatively short.  For example, people often claim that landline phone service was a natural monopoly, because how efficient would it have been to run multiple, competing phone lines?  While that certainly pointed to a difficulty early phone companies had, it doesn't really make it a natural monopoly,  Instead, the companies were working out agreements to share the phone lines, so that multiple lines weren't necessary.  Bell Telephone, however, successfully argued the natural monopoly argument to local legislators, and got them to grant local monopolies to phone companies, and Bell, being the biggest phone company at the time, was well-positioned to receive most of those government-granted monopolies.\\n\\nAnd, in fact, national telecommunications in the U.S. was nationalized, if only briefly:\\n\\nIn 1918 the federal government nationalized the entire telecommunications industry, with national security as the stated intent. Rates were regulated so that customers in large cities would pay higher rates to subsidize those in more remote areas. Vail was appointed to manage the telephone system with AT&T being paid a percentage of the telephone revenues. AT&T profited well from the nationalization arrangement which ended a year later. States then began regulating rates so that those in rural areas would not have to pay high prices, and competition was highly regulated or prohibited in local markets. Also, potential competitors were forbidden from installing new lines to compete, with state governments wishing to avoid duplication. The claim was that telephone service was a natural monopoly, meaning that one firm could better serve the public than two or more. Eventually, AT&T's market share amounted to what most would regard as a monopolistic share.\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_AT%26T\\n\\nThe history of phone service in the U.S. would have been very different if government intervention hadn't occurred.",1,2

We all play the IRS lottery to not get picked. \\nWhen someone's tax form gets picked and is incorrect, IRS resubmits the form as quickly as possible (without any tax benefits). \\nOne of the problems they check is the income.

T58NGMrUp0M,"Some notes on the weakened AT&T ... it was much larger and more profitable than the baby bells.  It ran 80% of the Internet.  It still had bell labs for its entire run.  I would trace its demise to the MCI worldcom multi-year illegality of stating false profits which real companies could not compete with.  Also a failure for the federal government to enforce the telecommunications completion act.  In the end the Internet bubble busted and the most unimaginative and backward baby bell, SBC, had the cash on hand to buy the name and what was left.",8,0

T58NGMrUp0M,"Apart from the third party operators out there, one familiar to those my age is GTE (General Telephone), whose service differed greatly from Bell/AT&T as they had to have their own phones and wires.  Don't forget before 1984, Bell was the only company to manufacture their own phones that customers could only pay to have installed in their homes.  You just don't go out and buy an extra phone as it didn't work that way.  That all changed after the breakup and we started to see a lot of cheaply-produced phones out on the market.  Bell System phones (made by Western Electric) were heavy and practically unbreakable like tanks. \\n\\nGetting back to GTE, they mostly serviced specific areas Bell wasn't it, usually rural/suburban.  My grandma had GTE where she was and I can remember the odd noise the dialer made and the rings itself.  I'm sure this all had to do with those  specific patents AT&T had.\\n\\nIt should be noted, outside of DirecTV, AT&T also has it's own broadband service including DSL and a cable TV service called U-Verse in a number of markets they do operate landline phone service in (like the former Ohio Bell in my state).",1,0

T58NGMrUp0M,"This video naturally overlooks a lot of history in order to keep the video relatively short.  For example, people often claim that landline phone service was a natural monopoly, because how efficient would it have been to run multiple, competing phone lines?  While that certainly pointed to a difficulty early phone companies had, it doesn't really make it a natural monopoly,  Instead, the companies were working out agreements to share the phone lines, so that multiple lines weren't necessary.  Bell Telephone, however, successfully argued the natural monopoly argument to local legislators, and got them to grant local monopolies to phone companies, and Bell, being the biggest phone company at the time, was well-positioned to receive most of those government-granted monopolies.\\n\\nAnd, in fact, national telecommunications in the U.S. was nationalized, if only briefly:\\n\\nIn 1918 the federal government nationalized the entire telecommunications industry, with national security as the stated intent. Rates were regulated so that customers in large cities would pay higher rates to subsidize those in more remote areas. Vail was appointed to manage the telephone system with AT&T being paid a percentage of the telephone revenues. AT&T profited well from the nationalization arrangement which ended a year later. States then began regulating rates so that those in rural areas would not have to pay high prices, and competition was highly regulated or prohibited in local markets. Also, potential competitors were forbidden from installing new lines to compete, with state governments wishing to avoid duplication. The claim was that telephone service was a natural monopoly, meaning that one firm could better serve the public than two or more. Eventually, AT&T's market share amounted to what most would regard as a monopolistic share.\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_AT%26T\\n\\nThe history of phone service in the U.S. would have been very different if government intervention hadn't occurred.",1,2

We all play the IRS lottery to not get picked. \\nWhen someone's tax form gets picked and is incorrect, IRS resubmits the form as quickly as possible (without any tax benefits). \\nOne of the problems they check is the income.

Plus, it's been established numerous times that Jerry's an idiot (Rick's words not mine!), so since when are we taking his word for anything??¬†Buuuut maybe that's just wishful thinking.¬†\\nSince the opposite is also likely, and maybe her development was just as simple as her learning to value her family more over Rick, rather than becoming more badass and in touch with the parts of her that make her like her dad. \\nThat being said~ having Beth go off on an adventure would mean c-137 has the Rickiest-Rick family of all.

iK7lICvUhCI,Jerry pulls them out of school‚Ä¶‚Ä¶\n\nAND the next episode basically confirms she IS a clone by her being unsure of her authenticity... the REAL Beth would KNOW!\n\n(Edit)\nAdditionally it could have been a ‚Äúlast meal‚Äù kind of thing while the clone was being cooked up.,0,0
iK7lICvUhCI,This season was so nothing if that was the finale omg,0,0
iK7lICvUhCI,"Counter theory. Even though Rick may have not had enough time to clone Beth by the time Morty and Summer get home, this does not mean that at the dinner scene that there isn't a clone of Beth being cooked up at that time. Beth could very easily have been that affectionate to Rick and the kids because she knew that it would be the last time she would see them for a while. Beth may have left in between episodes or when the kids were sleeping making the Beth in the finale actually a clone. Rick is able to clone Tommy with just a finger so we know that the person being cloned does not have to be there for the process, only a part of them, for example, a sample of Beth's blood, a few strands of hair, or some skin cells. My theory, dear Matpat, is that while Beth may be the real deal at the end of The ABC's of Beth episode that by the time the finale rolls around she could be gone already, replaced with a clone, and no one would notice. \\n\\nNOTE THAT THIS PARAGRAPH WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS FOR THE FINALE. That's why in the finale Beth brings up the discussion she had with Rick about being a clone, it was the show creator's way of reminding you that this happened, and they wouldn't do something like that unless it was VERY important. Which is further supported by the fact that it's so heavily focused on in regards to Beth and Jerry. Remember what she says while she's in Jerry's apartment, that she remembers hating that night but that she no longer does. Yes, it could be argued that this is simply because of her coming to accept herself for who she truly is and missing Jerry, but it's more likely, at least to me that this is what the CLONE is feeling. Rick may be a genius, but it's not like his experiments do not occasionally go wrong or have a fault. Let's not forget that the entire population of one of the realities were turned into monsters back in season one. Not to mention that wouldn't it be a much more satisfying plot point later when the real Beth comes home?\\n\\nSPOILERS CONTINUE. This is also why Rick does NOT shoot Beth at the end, it's not because she's his real daughter, it's because he doesn't want Beth's cover to be blown. He loves Beth, he even says so when suggesting that he clone her. He knows that Beth needs Rick to continue acting as if she's still there with them.\\n\\nOMG SO MANY SPOILERS LOL! So with the evidence I have described, her being affectionate to her family because she's leaving, the fact that she could have easily left between episodes or when no one was looking, that just because we don't see Beth being cloned doesn't mean it's not happening, the fact that it's brought up again in the finale to remind us that it happened, her renewed love for Jerry possibly being a flaw in the cloning process, and Rick wanting to maintain Beth's cover, would it really be so strange if finale Beth is clone Beth?\\n\\nSo while I do agree with your theory that Beth is real at the end of The ABC's of Beth, it's not impossible that she's a clone in the finale. But hey, that's just a theory...",0,0

Another thing is that Summer and Morty were taken out of school. That had to be on Monday. Another thing is wouldn't the cloning process take a lot less time because he has a full Beth to use. Rick said about 3 hours when he seen he only had the finger. He had the full Beth there so it would probably take a lot less time. And the cloning equipment was already set up so they don't have to bring it out. Any thoughts on my conclusions?",0,0

D&D are completely stupid and I'm starting to wonder if they read the first two books, got bored, and then just read spark notes to get them through the rest. They care more about their friendships with the actors than the dialogue the actors speak (bad pussy, dickon jokes, Tyrion and little finger's entire script) they're more about shock value than cohesive plots and actions for the characters that make sense (Jon giving up the north even though Dany had already consented to fight with his people and Arya wanting to kill Sansa) and most obviously, they care more about big action set pieces and pointless dragon/ polar bear scenes than Jon being with the direwolf that represents his connection with his REAL family, the Starks (because Ghost being with him at Dragonstone would remind him of the family that we literally see him ignore except to write *once* in the months he spends on the island).

But they did great nevertheless! :),3,0

7DV7TS3XB94,"My physics professor was just saying how the unique structure of the water molecule, with hydrogen bonding between the molecules, allows its liquid phase to be denser than its solid phase at cold temperatures, by forcing the solid to take an abnormal hexagonal structure, permitting ice to float on top of water and thereby preventing the ocean from filling with ice during ice ages, allowing life to survive underwater during them. It is a similar example of the necessity of design, one of many ways that life could not exist if physics were not constructed in such a way that the water molecule was very advantageous to the existence of life.",0,0

7DV7TS3XB94,"The native Mexican bees (such as this Melipona) that pollinate Vanilla orchids are not good at it, they generally only produce one fruit per hundred flowers. This is because the pollinator that the vanilla orchid co-evolved with has become extinct and no others are as perfectly suited to pollinating it. Without human propagation the vanilla orchid would probably be severely endangered or  extinct. There are many examples of this among orchids, especially those that attract male bees to pollinate them by pretending to be female bees  (perfect in smell and appearance to the male bee) and being pollinated while the bee thinks it is copulating. An example is Ophrys apifera. If that is God's work then God is decidedly peculiar.",0,0

7DV7TS3XB94,"Thanks for the video. Very interesting. I have both melipona bees and ka'an zac bees...both are sting-less. However, from what local Mayan beekeepers tell me, the melipona is too big to pollinate the vanilla flower. And so either the ka'an zac or the xilk' bee are the pollinators...both are much, much smaller than the melipona. My vanilla still has not flowered. My vines are about 3 years old. They are growing fine...just not flowering. Good to meet you.",2,0
7DV7TS3XB94,Damn it it's one of those creationists videos trying to sound science and fail. It was so interesting until you pull the bullshit at the end.\nThis is called co-evolution.The bee and the vanilla evolved together.,5,14
7DV7TS3XB94,"Made for eachother? More like exploiting the plant for its food source, and exploration of multiple niches to increase population viability. ¬†",6,18
7DV7TS3XB94,"what? the flower was normal, but he wilted ones probably taste better to the bees, so now there all wilted, because they were the only ones they pollinated. that's um theory",0,1

7DV7TS3XB94,"and rawnovember413 he isn't using an assumption he is proving there has to be a Creator (God), or else vanilla and melipona bees wouldn't survive.

7DV7TS3XB94,"You people are the most ignorant on the planet. There are many examples of specific pollinators. One of them is darwins moth. He was able to predict the existence of the pollinator by the requirement of the flower. Scienctists can make correct predictions while religious people do not. Why do you suppose that is? The pollinator benefits from the specificity by running a monopoly and the plant benefits as well if the pollinator takes care of pests. Textbook mutualism example easy. Uncommon minds indeed, no common sense.",6,0
7DV7TS3XB94,"The vanilla orchid and Melipona bee had to be made together. I'll take Dumb Fucking Statements for $1000, Alex. Read a book, old man, and not one that claims to know everything.",4,0
7DV7TS3XB94,"I live in the Yucatan of Mexico (possibly the home of vanilla). I am growing vanilla vines and I am husbanding (actually read that as keeping pets) both Melipona beechei (the Maya sting-less bees, also known as xunan cab in Yucatec Maya) and a much smaller sting-less bee called Ka'an Sac. My vanilla is not yet old enough to flower but I am hoping this year will be the year. I am told by Mayan beekeepers that the Melipona is too big to pollinate the vanilla flower but the Ka'an Sac is just the right size to enter the flower. We will see. Empirical evidence, in my opinion, trumps bibical extrapolation. When direct observation of an event or process fits the concept of evolution, it strengthens the concept. And to me, it matters a tinkers damn if the universe was created by intelligent design or by happenstance. It is wondrous, magical and awe-inspiring. And something that I will never understand. Nor do I feel the need to.",2,0
7DV7TS3XB94,I don't have to do better than anything. LOL! You'll find out for yourself when you die. ;o),0,0
7DV7TS3XB94,"A few things. First, the bee is pronounced as it sounds: Melipona. There are many species of Melipona - Melipona is a genus, and is one of many genus of stingless bees. Bees and other pollinators don't  know how to pollinate. They  know how to find and collect food ( pollen and nectar) - and their actions just happen to transfer pollen, often times pollinating the plant. Bees compete for flowers and flowers compete for bees, and a feedback loop happens which effects the physical qualities and actions of all involved over very long periods of time. The book The Forgotten Pollinators explains this and much more. The vanilla plant and it's specialist bee don't defy evolution at all - their story is as common as bumble bees and buzz pollination various plants",3,3

T58NGMrUp0M,"Apart from the third party operators out there, one familiar to those my age is GTE (General Telephone), whose service differed greatly from Bell/AT&T as they had to have their own phones and wires.  Don't forget before 1984, Bell was the only company to manufacture their own phones that customers could only pay to have installed in their homes.  You just don't go out and buy an extra phone as it didn't work that way.  That all changed after the breakup and we started to see a lot of cheaply-produced phones out on the market.  Bell System phones (made by Western Electric) were heavy and practically unbreakable like tanks. \\n\\nGetting back to GTE, they mostly serviced specific areas Bell wasn't it, usually rural/suburban.  My grandma had GTE where she was and I can remember the odd noise the dialer made and the rings itself.  I'm sure this all had to do with those  specific patents AT&T had.\\n\\nIt should be noted, outside of DirecTV, AT&T also has it's own broadband service including DSL and a cable TV service called U-Verse in a number of markets they do operate landline phone service in (like the former Ohio Bell in my state).",1,0

T58NGMrUp0M,"This video naturally overlooks a lot of history in order to keep the video relatively short.  For example, people often claim that landline phone service was a natural monopoly, because how efficient would it have been to run multiple, competing phone lines?  While that certainly pointed to a difficulty early phone companies had, it doesn't really make it a natural monopoly,  Instead, the companies were working out agreements to share the phone lines, so that multiple lines weren't necessary.  Bell Telephone, however, successfully argued the natural monopoly argument to local legislators, and got them to grant local monopolies to phone companies, and Bell, being the biggest phone company at the time, was well-positioned to receive most of those government-granted monopolies.\\n\\nAnd, in fact, national telecommunications in the U.S. was nationalized, if only briefly:\\n\\nIn 1918 the federal government nationalized the entire telecommunications industry, with national security as the stated intent. Rates were regulated so that customers in large cities would pay higher rates to subsidize those in more remote areas. Vail was appointed to manage the telephone system with AT&T being paid a percentage of the telephone revenues. AT&T profited well from the nationalization arrangement which ended a year later. States then began regulating rates so that those in rural areas would not have to pay high prices, and competition was highly regulated or prohibited in local markets. Also, potential competitors were forbidden from installing new lines to compete, with state governments wishing to avoid duplication. The claim was that telephone service was a natural monopoly, meaning that one firm could better serve the public than two or more. Eventually, AT&T's market share amounted to what most would regard as a monopolistic share.\\n\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_AT%26T\\n\\nThe history of phone service in the U.S. would have been very different if government intervention hadn't occurred.",1,2

iK7lICvUhCI,"So, here's the thing... Rick is smart... He's insanely smart... And as we saw in a previous episode he plans for eventualities in advance. (The Memory Mix-up Episode.) This entire theory falls apart when you look at the other side of the pizza. Yes... There was no time travel involved in getting the pizza.... But what if he had one laying around in advance? What if he already considered this might happen and had cloned Beth in before he even talked to her about it? He could have even revved up the cloner before they left to stop the execution. You remember how long it takes to go to and from? The fresh Beth clone would be ready before they got back. Then Rick pops the hypothetical and Beth either takes him up on it, or the Beth clone gets decomissioned. Zap!",0,0
iK7lICvUhCI,"Ok, so, I know you said they don't mess with time so I'm starting out with saying that that's not what I'm proposing. What I am proposing however is that what if only the pizza scene happened on a different day? Whose to say that cloning Beth didn't take that long and afterwards she went to bed to prepare for the start of her adventures the following day (Or maybe skip sleeping and just start adventuring) and then the next day have Rick test out the new clone with the kids and all we are seeing is the end of a long day of testing the clone ended by some nice family-time pizza!

iK7lICvUhCI,Well what if they went on a Friday afternoon right so that's mean they could've done it on Sunday but another question pop up tho didn't jerry picked Morty at school and one last thing maybe the affectionate beth and rick might be her goodbyes the last meal she's going to have with her family,0,0

iK7lICvUhCI,"Question, is there anything that contradicts the possibility that this episode could have started on a Friday? Friday is generally accepted as part of the weekend, and in all the cases of joint custody I've known in my life, the kids left Friday, and came back Sunday.

iK7lICvUhCI,But what about the time in season 2 last ep where they stopped time,0,0
iK7lICvUhCI,"When Beth spirals into the existential angst, the clock is at the same time as it was when they cloned Tommy. That would mean the hands on the clock may not be a calculated decision.

If so than that is a spot on theory, but I can't agree unless the execution happening  in the afternoon is as factual as you say it is.",0,0
iK7lICvUhCI,Just because they drove to the penitentiary doesn't mean they drove back. Maybe after dropping of Tommy they teleported themselves and the car back to the driveway.,0,0
iK7lICvUhCI,"Jerry pulled Morty and Summer out of school after he broke up with his new girlfriend. If we take this into account, the hunt was on Saturday night and the execution was still scheduled for Sunday. We never saw Summer and Morty get home Saturday night. In fact they could have gotten home Sunday night after the hunt the next day, which would mean that Jerry broke up with his girlfriend Monday morning when the two were in school. Meaning that when Summer and Morty got home on Monday night, Beth could have been a clone, because they got pizza on Monday and not Sunday.",0,0

D&D are completely stupid and I'm starting to wonder if they read the first two books, got bored, and then just read spark notes to get them through the rest. They care more about their friendships with the actors than the dialogue the actors speak (bad pussy, dickon jokes, Tyrion and little finger's entire script) they're more about shock value than cohesive plots and actions for the characters that make sense (Jon giving up the north even though Dany had already consented to fight with his people and Arya wanting to kill Sansa) and most obviously, they care more about big action set pieces and pointless dragon/ polar bear scenes than Jon being with the direwolf that represents his connection with his REAL family, the Starks (because Ghost being with him at Dragonstone would remind him of the family that we literally see him ignore except to write *once* in the months he spends on the island).

TRY IT ! I bloody bet nothing you sprawl out will equal half of the people Loving or even just mildly curious how its all going to turn out that watch Game of Thrones . Game of Thrones is not what it once was but it is not a regular t.v. series ....it has to come to an ending ; Game of Thrones has broken t.v. history records . The series is Lovingly and excitedly talked about on talk shows.... even when the series is off season and no one from Game of Thrones is scheduled to be on their talk shows. It wasn't up for any EMMY'S this year due to timing of Game of Thrones being later in the year as usual ; the series was given a Thank You by Stephen for giving other t.v. series a chance and as well as the series being mentioned in the beginning of the EMMY'S song introduction it was mentioned a few more times in praise . The nay sayers of Game of Thrones have no sense of imagination to be taken on someone elses journey and not their own ;they want what they like and anything different is off setting ....Game of Thrones is not their journey of story telling and imagination.

7DV7TS3XB94,"The native Mexican bees (such as this Melipona) that pollinate Vanilla orchids are not good at it, they generally only produce one fruit per hundred flowers. This is because the pollinator that the vanilla orchid co-evolved with has become extinct and no others are as perfectly suited to pollinating it. Without human propagation the vanilla orchid would probably be severely endangered or  extinct. There are many examples of this among orchids, especially those that attract male bees to pollinate them by pretending to be female bees  (perfect in smell and appearance to the male bee) and being pollinated while the bee thinks it is copulating. An example is Ophrys apifera. If that is God's work then God is decidedly peculiar.",0,0

7DV7TS3XB94,"Thanks for the video. Very interesting. I have both melipona bees and ka'an zac bees...both are sting-less. However, from what local Mayan beekeepers tell me, the melipona is too big to pollinate the vanilla flower. And so either the ka'an zac or the xilk' bee are the pollinators...both are much, much smaller than the melipona. My vanilla still has not flowered. My vines are about 3 years old. They are growing fine...just not flowering. Good to meet you.",2,0

7DV7TS3XB94,"I live in the Yucatan of Mexico (possibly the home of vanilla). I am growing vanilla vines and I am husbanding (actually read that as keeping pets) both Melipona beechei (the Maya sting-less bees, also known as xunan cab in Yucatec Maya) and a much smaller sting-less bee called Ka'an Sac. My vanilla is not yet old enough to flower but I am hoping this year will be the year. I am told by Mayan beekeepers that the Melipona is too big to pollinate the vanilla flower but the Ka'an Sac is just the right size to enter the flower. We will see. Empirical evidence, in my opinion, trumps bibical extrapolation. When direct observation of an event or process fits the concept of evolution, it strengthens the concept. And to me, it matters a tinkers damn if the universe was created by intelligent design or by happenstance. It is wondrous, magical and awe-inspiring. And something that I will never understand.

7DV7TS3XB94,"A few things. First, the bee is pronounced as it sounds: Melipona. There are many species of Melipona - Melipona is a genus, and is one of many genus of stingless bees. Bees and other pollinators don't  know how to pollinate. They  know how to find and collect food ( pollen and nectar) - and their actions just happen to transfer pollen, often times pollinating the plant. Bees compete for flowers and flowers compete for bees, and a feedback loop happens which effects the physical qualities and actions of all involved over very long periods of time. The book The Forgotten Pollinators explains this and much more. The vanilla plant and it's specialist bee don't defy evolution at all - their story is as common as bumble bees and buzz pollination various plants",3,3

D&D are completely stupid and I'm starting to wonder if they read the first two books, got bored, and then just read spark notes to get them through the rest. They care more about their friendships with the actors than the dialogue the actors speak (bad pussy, dickon jokes, Tyrion and little finger's entire script) they're more about shock value than cohesive plots and actions for the characters that make sense (Jon giving up the north even though Dany had already consented to fight with his people and Arya wanting to kill Sansa) and most obviously, they care more about big action set pieces and pointless dragon/ polar bear scenes than Jon being with the direwolf that represents his connection with his REAL family, the Starks (because Ghost being with him at Dragonstone would remind him of the family that we literally see him ignore except to write *once* in the months he spends on the island).

I feel game of thrones is just been rushed now, like this zombie polar bear contributed nothing to the plot. No one important died from it, it didn't lead to anything they just killed it and moved on. It was just action for the sake of action. Smart, thought out intelligent screen writing with good pay offs and twists made game of thrones great. Not pointless action like in the walking dead.",0,0

The nay sayers of Game of Thrones have no sense of imagination to be taken on someone elses journey and not their own ;they want what they like and anything different is off setting ....Game of Thrones is not their journey of story telling and imagination.  They have their own and one day maybe they will write it .",0,0

He is the only Way to receive eternal life! \\n\\nJohn 3:16  For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\\n\\nChrist shed His blood as the ultimate sacrifice, to pay for all of man's sin. God offered His Son as a personal sacrifice for us, because He loves us so much. Every one is a sinner. No one is good enough to get into Heaven. But through  the Blood of Jesus Christ, He has made a way, the only WAY as Christ said. \\n\\nJohn 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me.\\n\\nThe gift of salvation is free: Believe in Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior. \\n\\nRomans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\\n\\nAs of today, this will be a time of decision and you will never be the same today, even if you refuse Christ you'll never be the same once you've faced Him, once you've heard the gospel and rejected it you can never be the same. The Bible says when the rich young ruler rejected Christ, he turned away, grieved emotionally disturbed, because when you reject the claims of Christ that's a very serious thing. This is the most important moment of decision making, for today your life will never be the same. If you reject Christ, you will be cast into HELL and there shall you be for ALL ETERNITY! I am not judging, I am warning everyone...\\n\\nI pray you will call upon the Lord Jesus Christ. Repent, ask Him to forgive you of your sins. Allow the Holy Ghost to enter your heart and transform you in an awesome way... Believe in Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.",0,1

Wheat grass (which grows abundantly almost everywhere, especially near roadsides) can be ground down to flour and made into bread. It tastes bland, but helps by giving you energy providing carbs.",0,0

Most of them ended up being bought by scalpers who wanted to turn a profit, meaning a tremendous amount of people who wanted the system never got the chance to buy one, especially after Nintendo announced they were cancelling their run of the system.

rKOaloQ5rnA,"Sane, normal people regard an occasional mass-shooting by a nutcase as the lesser-of-two-evils.The alternative, which is having a ban on guns, would mean that Neo-Marxist Homofascists would try institute their own authoritarian rule by force. Such Leftist Lunatics know, as well as we do, that, as long as there are 300+ million weapons in this country, the majority of which are owned by sane normal people, the chances of any group violating the original intent of our Constitution is pretty much  zero. Indeed, the reason that the 1st and 2nd Amendments were created was because prescient individuals realized that societies decay, not because the whole of the population wants it to decay, because some a cancerous, creeping minority  manages to infect the State, violating our laws, employing the State to violate our rights, and using expressions like...Yes, it's illegal, but it is for the greater good.... Such creeps are always recognizable: They are the ones who want to disarm everyone else, by banning both weapons and certain kinds of speech for the greater good. \\n\\nThat simply is not going to happen.\\n\\nWhat's far more likely to happen is that those Leftist Lunatics who have already surrendered their composure, because they foolishly believed that the era of Obama was the long-awaited Gateway to Neo-Marxist Homofascist Socialistic Utopia, are going to learn the hard way that they made a grave error in judgement. True to their nature, eventually, they will not be able to contain themselves by letting go of never-to-be-fulfilled expectations and reverting to self-restraint, as specified by our laws, and they will move quickly to armed conflict. If that happens, videos like these will not be necessary. Every Leftist Lunatic who precedes that mass-conflict with slashing our tires, burning buildings, throwing feces, throwing urine, breaking windows, and assaulting others, will get a crash-course in how firearms work. \\n\\nBased on how erratic the Left has become in their political discourse, the question is not whether this will happen, but when.",1,0
rKOaloQ5rnA,"The bump stock didn't attribute much to the¬†death rate in LV. A semi-auto would fire fewer rounds but would've had better control or accuracy. He was literally spraying and praying. A standard bolt action with a scope would've killed similar numbers as would've a semi-auto in heavier caliber. 500¬†wounded most likely because at that distance, the 223 was loosing some inertia, resulting in injuries and not kills. We could debate the effectiveness of the bump stock for decades without knowing if it did or didn't contribute to the death rate. But, one thing is for sure, he was a motivated shooter and he would've did¬†this with or with out the aid of the bump stock. The bump stock is just a scapegoat for the government to appear to be doing something in the aftermath of this crazy episode in Americas history. IMHO, the inflammatory and divisive liberal media contributed more to this than the bump stock.",1,0

rKOaloQ5rnA,"Even the most conservative estimates puts the number of mass shootings in 2017 at several dozen (with other estimates putting it as high as the 270s), which has no comparison in the developed world. This is clearly an untenable situation, and one which needs addressing by legislators who are sitting on their hands due to fears or primary challengers backed by the gun-manufacturer's lobby (NRA).... but what's often lost in this heated debate is the vast majority of those who die at the end of a gun: people who commit suicide. \\n\\nIn the US, according to a 2008 Harvard School of Public Health publication, suicides outnumber homicides by a ratio of 2:1 and the success of a suicide attempt is largely determined by method. Firearms are the most effective method of suicide, statistically, and every study on the issue has concluded that there is a very strong correlative link between firearm ownership and successful suicides. Other common methods including the ingestion of poison, hanging, ingesting of pills/alcohol, and suffocation are nowhere near as effective and have relatively high survival rates. Because a suicide attempt itself is so often an impulsive act, having a reliable and effective method of killing one's self immediately at hand means more suicide.¬†\\n\\nMass shootings are, each and all, tremendous tragedies. The loss of innocent life is always an injustice, and we are right to have a strong reaction to them. The problem is that the press largely makes money off views and subscriptions, and those can be earned or maintained more easily through sensationalism than a more objective presentation of data and analysis to arm the public with knowledge. While it's nice that mental illness is finally brought to the forefront of the national discussion in the wake of mass shooting tragedies, not only is it often a disingenuous political tactic by gun proponents but it also never seems to lead to productive discussion about depression, anxiety, stress, schizophrenia, or other major mental health burdens affection millions of Americans.¬†\\n\\nIf we're serious about considering legislation on guns intended to both respect individual liberties and protect the most innocent people, if we're serious about the mental health crisis in the US, we can't just make this discussion about legislation on gun design. And the members of the NRA have to get serious about taking back their organization from the gun lobby; we need an association which helps to train people with firearms for competency and safety, and to actually represent firearm owners.",2,2

D&D are completely stupid and I'm starting to wonder if they read the first two books, got bored, and then just read spark notes to get them through the rest. They care more about their friendships with the actors than the dialogue the actors speak (bad pussy, dickon jokes, Tyrion and little finger's entire script) they're more about shock value than cohesive plots and actions for the characters that make sense (Jon giving up the north even though Dany had already consented to fight with his people and Arya wanting to kill Sansa) and most obviously, they care more about big action set pieces and pointless dragon/ polar bear scenes than Jon being with the direwolf that represents his connection with his REAL family, the Starks (because Ghost being with him at Dragonstone would remind him of the family that we literally see him ignore except to write *once* in the months he spends on the island).

TRY IT ! I bloody bet nothing you sprawl out will equal half of the people Loving or even just mildly curious how its all going to turn out that watch Game of Thrones . Game of Thrones is not what it once was but it is not a regular t.v. series ....it has to come to an ending ; Game of Thrones has broken t.v. history records . The series is Lovingly and excitedly talked about on talk shows.... even when the series is off season and no one from Game of Thrones is scheduled to be on their talk shows. It wasn't up for any EMMY'S this year due to timing of Game of Thrones being later in the year as usual ; the series was given a Thank You by Stephen for giving other t.v. series a chance and as well as the series being mentioned in the beginning of the EMMY'S song introduction it was mentioned a few more times in praise . The nay sayers of Game of Thrones have no sense of imagination to be taken on someone elses journey and not their own ;they want what they like and anything different is off setting ....Game of Thrones is not their journey of story telling and imagination.  They have their own and one day maybe they will write it .",0,0

lQX0jvVQywQ,Love it... I could be wrong but I see it as being about not sharing the same feelings and arguing about it over and over with a person until you stop talking because nothing can change how they feel and one person needs space and then the other person loses a friend- that no amount of talking can change the facts. You're forced to choose between pretending to feel something and having your friend or telling the truth and losing a friend. And then you have this void and you can't stop thinking about the person you've lost and you realize what a big part of your life they were. Sad to see them sad but great video for a great song!,0,0

hhREiAarjVY,"Prayer does no good except for yourself due to the Placebo Effect. Christian hospitals have found that praying for other never works for others.  God is not listening; there is no god.  Of course their was a creator a la the Big Bang Theory or something like that but all the holy books were written by men of their times. \\n\\nGood thing there is no god. God debases. I don't believe in myths and in a Bible where parents are to stone and kill children for misbehaving; males can stone and kill false virgins on their wedding night; people are stoned and killed for working on the Sabbath. And this is just a small amount of the nonsense and illogic of the babbling bibles.  Ah the wonderful peaceful New Testament? It shows Jesus indicating morality doesn't count for much. Those who believe in the Son will find everlasting life and those who do not accept Jesus as god will  find and gnashing of teeth at the gates of heaven. What a bastard.\\n\\n And Jesus believed in slavery: servants obey your master. Jesus knew less about science than pre schoolers of today. Germ Theory? Knowledge of any medical facts in the Bible? It amazes me that religious people aren't a hell of a lot more moral than Atheists. All of those regularly suppressed studies show no difference in morality except that religious people give more to charities as they stupidly think they are buying a stairway to heaven. \\n\\nReligion is based . . . mainly on fear . . . fear of the mysterious, fear of defeat, fear of death. Fear is the parent of cruelty, and therefore it is no wonder if cruelty and religion have gone hand in hand. . . . My own view on religion is that of Lucretius. I regard it as a disease born of fear and as a source of untold misery to the human race. [Bertrand Russell]\\n\\nAtheists are way way underrepresented in prison populations ? Only .002% of the prison population in the US. I am not saying they commit less crimes only that Atheists are smartest and commit over 90 percent of the crimes but they fix it so the dumb religious nuts do the time.  Studies show Agnostics morality is as high as believers. Believe me the results of these studies are suppressed by our Christian nation.  Atheists do good and bad as most everyone else but live lives without heaven as the carrot on the stick.\\n\\nI think decent biology and not being dropped on your head as an infant and good upbringing far outweighs a thousand visits to holy places and millions of prayers.\\n\\nHey but if it helps you to feel better and superior to me , a doping Agnostic, be my guest.",0,0

Also, murder, stealing, and cannibalism will be more prevalent in third world countries  (more than 1st world countries). Although millions would die in the USA, I'd say we have a greater chance to create self sustaining communities. We have lots of land to farm, and guns to hunt and protect from riffraff from cities and poverty areas.  Riffraff from cities and poverty areas (designated before the apocalypse) are more likely to murder and steal within their own communities for some time, before making their way out. This time will be enough for small towns/communities to setup perimeters for defense and offense, against the riffraff. Anyone deemed to be riffraff in these towns/communities will be dealt with swiftly/harshly (maybe purged/killed). Some towns/communities will fall a part (destroy themselves), and some will survive. Over the course of 20-30 years, those that survive, will form pacts with other neighboring towns/communities, and begin trading (they will also protect each other). In 50-75 years there will be massive territories formed, and in 100 years they will unit, forming new states under one government. The USA will then be reborn, either being almost equal or worse than our current government. Then, in 150 years, we will once again become #1 in the world (yes, I am a proud American. Having pride for ones country does not make you a pos like many would have you believe. Most countries people have pride in their countries, and to say Americans can't makes that person a dumb@$$. Americans that hate their country should gtfo, instead of trying to massively overhaul everything that makes America great).

rKOaloQ5rnA,"hate the ‚Äúif people really want guns they‚Äôll get them‚Äù argument. that‚Äôs not the point. the point is a mentally ill person who‚Äôs having an episode can talk a walk over to walmart and be stocked up with weapons in 20 minutes. people just want to make it a little bit harder for people to get their hands on guns. \\n\\ni live in canada and know people who sport shoot and own guns, and that‚Äôs okay. but i appreciate the fact they had to put in effort to obtain their guns.",10,5
rKOaloQ5rnA,"You can have your bump stocks ban, I don't care its not going to fix the real problems we have in the world. That has nothing to do with guns.",10,20
rKOaloQ5rnA,"The bump stock didn't attribute much to the¬†death rate in LV. A semi-auto would fire fewer rounds but would've had better control or accuracy. He was literally spraying and praying. A standard bolt action with a scope would've killed similar numbers as would've a semi-auto in heavier caliber. 500¬†wounded most likely because at that distance, the 223 was loosing some inertia, resulting in injuries and not kills. We could debate the effectiveness of the bump stock for decades without knowing if it did or didn't contribute to the death rate. But, one thing is for sure, he was a motivated shooter and he would've did¬†this with or with out the aid of the bump stock. The bump stock is just a scapegoat for the government to appear to be doing something in the aftermath of this crazy episode in Americas history. IMHO, the inflammatory and divisive liberal media contributed more to this than the bump stock.",1,0
rKOaloQ5rnA,"Banning guns isn't going to solve anything. if someone wants to commit a mass shooting or killing, they are going to find a way to get the weapon they want. Whether that's a gun, truck, or bomb. I would rather they try to obtain it through the government, where it's regulated with it's stringent background check and training, than letting them get it through illegal and unregistered means.",6,7
rKOaloQ5rnA,"Even the most conservative estimates puts the number of mass shootings in 2017 at several dozen (with other estimates putting it as high as the 270s), which has no comparison in the developed world. This is clearly an untenable situation, and one which needs addressing by legislators who are sitting on their hands due to fears or primary challengers backed by the gun-manufacturer's lobby (NRA).... but what's often lost in this heated debate is the vast majority of those who die at the end of a gun: people who commit suicide. \\n\\nIn the US, according to a 2008 Harvard School of Public Health publication, suicides outnumber homicides by a ratio of 2:1 and the success of a suicide attempt is largely determined by method. Firearms are the most effective method of suicide, statistically, and every study on the issue has concluded that there is a very strong correlative link between firearm ownership and successful suicides. Other common methods including the ingestion of poison, hanging, ingesting of pills/alcohol, and suffocation are nowhere near as effective and have relatively high survival rates. Because a suicide attempt itself is so often an impulsive act, having a reliable and effective method of killing one's self immediately at hand means more suicide.¬†\\n\\nMass shootings are, each and all, tremendous tragedies. The loss of innocent life is always an injustice, and we are right to have a strong reaction to them. The problem is that the press largely makes money off views and subscriptions, and those can be earned or maintained more easily through sensationalism than a more objective presentation of data and analysis to arm the public with knowledge. While it's nice that mental illness is finally brought to the forefront of the national discussion in the wake of mass shooting tragedies, not only is it often a disingenuous political tactic by gun proponents but it also never seems to lead to productive discussion about depression, anxiety, stress, schizophrenia, or other major mental health burdens affection millions of Americans.¬†\\n\\nIf we're serious about considering legislation on guns intended to both respect individual liberties and protect the most innocent people, if we're serious about the mental health crisis in the US, we can't just make this discussion about legislation on gun design. And the members of the NRA have to get serious about taking back their organization from the gun lobby; we need an association which helps to train people with firearms for competency and safety, and to actually represent firearm owners.",2,2
rKOaloQ5rnA,Time to start fighting for our rights,1,2
rKOaloQ5rnA,"To those who defend the sale and ownership of bump stocks, please justify and help us understand why you need modified semi-automatic weapons to defend yourselves?",1,2
rKOaloQ5rnA,If you have a brain and you're not out of your mind crazy or a liberal go buy a gun it's the best purchase you will ever make it could save you life one day and omg is it so fun to shoot. These liberals have no clue if they shot a gun they would love it. Registered Democrats like mass shootings tho so if you're a democrat it should be alot harder to get a gun legally.,1,1
rKOaloQ5rnA,"Sane, normal people regard an occasional mass-shooting by a nutcase as the lesser-of-two-evils.The alternative, which is having a ban on guns, would mean that Neo-Marxist Homofascists would try institute their own authoritarian rule by force. Such Leftist Lunatics know, as well as we do, that, as long as there are 300+ million weapons in this country, the majority of which are owned by sane normal people, the chances of any group violating the original intent of our Constitution is pretty much  zero. Indeed, the reason that the 1st and 2nd Amendments were created was because prescient individuals realized that societies decay, not because the whole of the population wants it to decay, but because a cancerous, creeping minority  manages to infect the State, violating our laws, employing the State to violate our rights, then using expressions like...Yes, it's illegal, but it is for the greater good.... Such creeps are always recognizable: They are the ones who want to disarm everyone else, by banning both weapons and certain kinds of speech for the greater good. \\n\\nThat simply is not going to happen.\\n\\nWhat's far more likely to happen is that those Leftist Lunatics who have already surrendered their composure, because they foolishly believed that the era of Obama was the long-awaited Gateway to Neo-Marxist Homofascist Socialistic Utopia, are going to learn the hard way that they made a grave error in judgement. True to their nature, eventually, they will not be able to contain themselves by letting go of never-to-be-fulfilled expectations and reverting to self-restraint, as specified by our laws, and they will move quickly to armed conflict. If that happens, videos like these will not be necessary. Every Leftist Lunatic who precedes that mass-conflict with slashing our tires, burning buildings, throwing feces, throwing urine, breaking windows, and assaulting others, will get a crash-course in how firearms work. \\n\\nBased on how erratic the Left has become in their political discourse, the question is not whether this will happen, but when.",1,1

Now if it was me I think he should fight Dom before he fights Cody because to me Cody is the best at that weight division and that's if he goes up or has a super fight.,0,0

W4YZIAtS-S0,"hello there! i think i've figured out how the mask works. the cable plugs into the headphone jack, so yes, there will be electric current running through the metal, as you indicated with the multimeter. however, there is no current detected on the mask because the electrodes are essentially earbuds. the current you picked up from the metal connectors is converted to vibrations, similar to how earbuds work. the mask acts like a conductor to distribute the vibrations throughout your face, and that's probably what you end up feeling.",0,0

W4YZIAtS-S0,"Thankfully they didn't have you hook the mask into the power port of the phone, because an amperage reading like you did may have blown the meter (since you were shorting the leads, which most likely 1 is positive and the other negative and your face is suppose to be the resistance on the line).  I'm curious what the reading was though.  0.03m or 30 micro amps.  I guess I would have liked to see the voltage reading.  Since it takes 10KV on dry skin to break the barrier, where as oily skin may take 1KV.\\n\\nI guess I wouldn't believe the audio port to be able to output enough to do anything to affect you, but also you were on DC I believe I noticed and your audio should be AC.

lQX0jvVQywQ,Love it... I could be wrong but I see it as being about not sharing the same feelings and arguing about it over and over with a person until you stop talking because nothing can change how they feel and one person needs space and then the other person loses a friend- that no amount of talking can change the facts. You're forced to choose between pretending to feel something and having your friend or telling the truth and losing a friend. And then you have this void and you can't stop thinking about the person you've lost and you realize what a big part of your life they were. Sad to see them sad but great video for a great song!,0,0

uLxuaQSBNe8,"It's easy to laugh when they have no idea of the context. When Nintendo released the NES Classic, many stores were only given about 4 or so and then they never got any more. Most of them ended up being bought by scalpers who wanted to turn a profit, meaning a tremendous amount of people who wanted the system never got the chance to buy one, especially after Nintendo announced they were cancelling their run of the system. It's only natural to assume the same would happen here seeing as that's just how Nintendo has been running their ship for a while now, so can you really blame these two for waiting for hours to make absolute certain they got the thing they wanted?",8,0

rKOaloQ5rnA,"Banning guns isn't going to solve anything. if someone wants to commit a mass shooting or killing, they are going to find a way to get the weapon they want. Whether that's a gun, truck, or bomb.

rKOaloQ5rnA,"The bump stock didn't attribute much to the¬†death rate in LV. A semi-auto would fire fewer rounds but would've had better control or accuracy. He was literally spraying and praying. A standard bolt action with a scope would've killed similar numbers as would've a semi-auto in heavier caliber. 500¬†wounded most likely because at that distance, the 223 was loosing some inertia, resulting in injuries and not kills.

rKOaloQ5rnA,"Even the most conservative estimates puts the number of mass shootings in 2017 at several dozen (with other estimates putting it as high as the 270s), which has no comparison in the developed world. This is clearly an untenable situation, and one which needs addressing by legislators who are sitting on their hands due to fears or primary challengers backed by the gun-manufacturer's lobby (NRA).... but what's often lost in this heated debate is the vast majority of those who die at the end of a gun: people who commit suicide. \\n\\nIn the US, according to a 2008 Harvard School of Public Health publication, suicides outnumber homicides by a ratio of 2:1 and the success of a suicide attempt is largely determined by method. Firearms are the most effective method of suicide, statistically, and every study on the issue has concluded that there is a very strong correlative link between firearm ownership and successful suicides. Other common methods including the ingestion of poison, hanging, ingesting of pills/alcohol, and suffocation are nowhere near as effective and have relatively high survival rates. Because a suicide attempt itself is so often an impulsive act, having a reliable and effective method of killing one's self immediately at hand means more suicide.¬†\\n\\nMass shootings are, each and all, tremendous tragedies. The loss of innocent life is always an injustice, and we are right to have a strong reaction to them. The problem is that the press largely makes money off views and subscriptions, and those can be earned or maintained more easily through sensationalism than a more objective presentation of data and analysis to arm the public with knowledge. While it's nice that mental illness is finally brought to the forefront of the national discussion in the wake of mass shooting tragedies, not only is it often a disingenuous political tactic by gun proponents but it also never seems to lead to productive discussion about depression, anxiety, stress, schizophrenia, or other major mental health burdens affection millions of Americans.¬†\\n\\nIf we're serious about considering legislation on guns intended to both respect individual liberties and protect the most innocent people, if we're serious about the mental health crisis in the US, we can't just make this discussion about legislation on gun design. And the members of the NRA have to get serious about taking back their organization from the gun lobby; we need an association which helps to train people with firearms for competency and safety, and to actually represent firearm owners.",2,2

rKOaloQ5rnA,"Sane, normal people regard an occasional mass-shooting by a nutcase as the lesser-of-two-evils.The alternative, which is having a ban on guns, would mean that Neo-Marxist Homofascists would try institute their own authoritarian rule by force. Such Leftist Lunatics know, as well as we do, that, as long as there are 300+ million weapons in this country, the majority of which are owned by sane normal people, the chances of any group violating the original intent of our Constitution is pretty much  zero. Indeed, the reason that the 1st and 2nd Amendments were created was because prescient individuals realized that societies decay, not because the whole of the population wants it to decay, but because a cancerous, creeping minority  manages to infect the State, violating our laws, employing the State to violate our rights, then using expressions like...Yes, it's illegal, but it is for the greater good.... Such creeps are always recognizable: They are the ones who want to disarm everyone else, by banning both weapons and certain kinds of speech for the greater good. \\n\\nThat simply is not going to happen.\\n\\nWhat's far more likely to happen is that those Leftist Lunatics who have already surrendered their composure, because they foolishly believed that the era of Obama was the long-awaited Gateway to Neo-Marxist Homofascist Socialistic Utopia, are going to learn the hard way that they made a grave error in judgement. True to their nature, eventually, they will not be able to contain themselves by letting go of never-to-be-fulfilled expectations and reverting to self-restraint, as specified by our laws, and they will move quickly to armed conflict. If that happens, videos like these will not be necessary. Every Leftist Lunatic who precedes that mass-conflict with slashing our tires, burning buildings, throwing feces, throwing urine, breaking windows, and assaulting others, will get a crash-course in how firearms work. \\n\\nBased on how erratic the Left has become in their political discourse, the question is not whether this will happen, but when.",1,2

You see a devil can never gain entry into your home unless you open up your doors.  A white man saw an opportunity, a home where there's no love,  a home with its doors wide opened.  He took advantage of it and stepped in.  It is more like in any game.  We all play to win. We search for open spaces and vulnerability in our opponents.  We seize it to win,  my point being this is exactly what the colonial masters did.  Question is, how are we as black people been playing defense  ever since ? First defence is one love  for ourselves and fellow men.  Truth of the matter is we as black people just ain't got it. From Africa to America, same shit is still happening with us all day, every day.

EVERLEARNING IN CHURCH INSTITUTIONS AND NEVER KNOWING JESUS. NEVER HEARING THE FATHER VOICE.Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons DIDNT WE ATTEND CHURCH but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven.REPENTANCE,OBEDIENCE AND LOVE ARE THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN.

qCH73iQAZS4,i agree I think DJ is one of the best of all time. unfortunately he's going to need to beat someone with a legacy to cement his legendary status. if he beats tj or Cody (or both) there will be no doubt in my mind that he's the #1 p4p fighter of all time. until he beats a legend - he can't be a legend. ray borg is good for a #1 contender but when you look at other weight classes he is nowhere near some of the other guys at that rank. i personally think the LW and LHW are stacked with talent and potential champions. well the only clear talent in the flyweight division is DJ. same thing for Joanna in the strawweight division. namajunas is very talented but if she's the best contender for Joanna it just shows the skill Gap in the division. set up a super fight with DJ fighting the winner of TJ vs garbrandt,0,0

W4YZIAtS-S0,I think the reason you stopped feeling the buzzing (cuz it seemed like you felt buzzing at the beginning) is that you get used to electric current fairly quickly. I know because I worked in Physical therapy and we use electric current with electrodes similar to the ones you used and everyone almost always stopped feeling it after a few minutes. So they should let you control it so you can up the voltage and feel it again. (If that's safe for the face anyway).,0,0

Most of them ended up being bought by scalpers who wanted to turn a profit, meaning a tremendous amount of people who wanted the system never got the chance to buy one, especially after Nintendo announced they were cancelling their run of the system. It's only natural to assume the same would happen here seeing as that's just how Nintendo has been running their ship for a while now, so can you really blame these two for waiting for hours to make absolute certain they got the thing they wanted?",8,0

Does that make him the GOAT, it's tough to say cuz Anderson Silva pre-injury and steroids was a dominant fighter against what seemed to be tougher competition compared to DJ's competition. I remember watching fights where he made legends look bad and he seemed untouchable. Yet with the term GREATEST, it's hard to argue with the record for title defenses, beating everyone in your weight class, and you seem to be unstoppable. The guys DJ fought are also well trained and skilled competition. Maybe their names aren't as well known or as popular as other past fighters but that doesn't mean they're not good. So it's tough to say he's definitely THE GOAT, cuz of guys like Anderson Silva and George ST Pierre but he's up there in the debate.",0,0

qCH73iQAZS4,i agree I think DJ is one of the best of all time. unfortunately he's going to need to beat someone with a legacy to cement his legendary status. if he beats tj or Cody (or both) there will be no doubt in my mind that he's the #1 p4p fighter of all time. until he beats a legend - he can't be a legend. ray borg is good for a #1 contender but when you look at other weight classes he is nowhere near some of the other guys at that rank. i personally think the LW and LHW are stacked with talent and potential champions. well the only clear talent in the flyweight division is DJ. same thing for Joanna in the strawweight division. namajunas is very talented but if she's the best contender for Joanna it just shows the skill Gap in the division. set up a super fight with DJ fighting the winner of TJ vs garbrandt,0,0

What are you going to do to raise daughters who aren't like these women, to raise daughters who don't like bad boys and who don't reject good men for being too nice like most young women? Feminists claim that it's empowerment for women to go to parties and get banged by guys, yet they attack a guy like Weinstein for banging them (because he's old and not hot enough; that's the real issue, but that doesn't make someone a victim). It's totally hypocritical and total and complete nonsense. Those women went after Weinstein because they were after his money and power, and they used sex to get it. They aren't victims.

WFb0EDl-JS8,"I love everything you said, Mayim, and here's what I've been thinking as a soon to be mother for the first time, of a boy no less! üòÑ\\n\\nLike you said at the beginning, I feel like every single person (male, female, anywhere in between) wants to be loved and feel safe. In our society, boys are not safe expressing negative emotions, dominating ones like aggression and anger as well as vulnerable ones such as sadness or fear. Boys (and girls!) are going to feel angry. They're going to feel sad. If we tell them, You can't feel that here! How can they ever feel safe or loved? How can they even learn to work throoough those feelings? So, I feel like a huge thing to teach a boy, along with consent and all of that, is how to deal with his own emotions in a positive way that will actually help him continue forward without hurting others or himself. When a human being isn't able to get his or her emotional needs met simply by communicating them, they will switch to manipulation. Men, on average, can become dominant, overbearing, aggressive, and even violent; women, on average, can become passive aggressive, backstab-y, naggy, play dumb or weak to get their needs met as well. Of course, from the outside this is obviously not the healthy way to do it!\\n\\nI just wanted to share that if we could teach children how to express and work through their own negative emotions, and in turn teach them empathy for others' feelings and vulnerabilities, maaaany problems would be solved even before they began.",0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"Thank you for bring this up. As a jewish feminist I wanted to bring two things up. We all need to be shocked and do something about this behaviour. If you know someone is doing something like this it is YOUR job to go to the police and child services to report it. It isn't right to stand by and know this is going on and not do anything about it ourselves. The second point is about addressing all those beliefs we have about women. We shouldn't dress a certain way or we are asking for it, we shouldn't go out alone because we are vulnerable as women.... Men need to be and are responsible for their own behaviour. It's up to us teach our sons that these beliefs are wrong. Just some of the beliefs about men are wrong. No Mayim, not all men want one thing. It's an important lesson for everyone to learn. So, as some who holds social justice near and dear (being myself), I challenge you to even anonymously to call the police on anyone you know who is being hurt.

Not all porn, even just video, is somehow demeaning to women. Some people like video of dom women, or literature about their favorite book characters, or even videos of things that normal people would not find sexual at all. It all varies to the taste and product the user consumes. I know women who like literature about dom men or dom women, does this somehow demean them or men in general? Curious about your opinion and what your reaction will be when your hormonal teenage boys start looking it up. I can't imagine they will stop engaging in mastubatory aides because you dissaprove, more likely to encourage them to hide or go around you?  Whats your take?",0,1

qCH73iQAZS4,"I haven't watched many of his fights but i know he's the best that his division has ever seen. Does that make him the GOAT, it's tough to say cuz Anderson Silva pre-injury and steroids was a dominant fighter against what seemed to be tougher competition compared to DJ's competition. I remember watching fights where he made legends look bad and he seemed untouchable. Yet with the term GREATEST, it's hard to argue with the record for title defenses, beating everyone in your weight class, and you seem to be unstoppable. The guys DJ fought are also well trained and skilled competition. Maybe their names aren't as well known or as popular as other past fighters but that doesn't mean they're not good. So it's tough to say he's definitely THE GOAT, cuz of guys like Anderson Silva and George ST Pierre but he's up there in the debate.",0,0

qCH73iQAZS4,i agree I think DJ is one of the best of all time. unfortunately he's going to need to beat someone with a legacy to cement his legendary status. if he beats tj or Cody (or both) there will be no doubt in my mind that he's the #1 p4p fighter of all time. until he beats a legend - he can't be a legend. ray borg is good for a #1 contender but when you look at other weight classes he is nowhere near some of the other guys at that rank. i personally think the LW and LHW are stacked with talent and potential champions. well the only clear talent in the flyweight division is DJ. same thing for Joanna in the strawweight division. namajunas is very talented but if she's the best contender for Joanna it just shows the skill Gap in the division. set up a super fight with DJ fighting the winner of TJ vs garbrandt,0,0

lQX0jvVQywQ,"To everyone who interprets this as Mitch having a thing for Scott, but vainly trying to get rid of it: just because they decided Mitch would have the lead on this song, doesn't mean it's written from his perspective. We all know they wrote their songs together, so it's equally possible most of the input for (the feelings behind) the lyrics could've been from Scott. The roles in the video are just convenient because Mitch sings the lead, but he does so in almost the entire album. That doesn't mean he wrote all the songs. You get what I'm trying to say? :) On the other hand, it could be inspired by other people they know, and not by personal experiences. It's open for interpretation, right? Anyway, I think they did the acting greatly. It's a fucking good video.",2,1

It saddened me that people would rather laugh or ignore something than deal with it but I have nieces, a sisters and nephews and I needed to speak up for them.",0,0

Make sure they know that you will be there to support and encourage them......also, ive herd learning cra meaga(?) is a fun family activity.",1,0
WFb0EDl-JS8,"I understand your outrage about the Hollywood institution of exploitation.  I feel the same way about any person or agency of power. I was also taught that men would do anything for sex, first by my father, and members of my mother's extended family, raping me off and on from age 2 to13, and then by a Xian cult religion. From the time I was in puberty, most of the women in my family, and life, treated me like I was about to rape them all the time. This screwed me up just as much as the sexual abuse forced on me by men! It is a psychological sexual abuse rather than a physical one, but just as damaging! I hated myself because I was male, and tried until I was 36 to be a sexless woman so my extended family would love me!\\n\\nI've learned through 20+ years of healing, that most men would NEVER intentionally hurt anyone with their sexuality! It took looking at people's behavior more objectively and comparing it to my conditioning and finding that more often, men were just as likely as women to be loving and kind and nurturing. It took me a long time to believe that truth! I also found that women were just as likely to abuse themselves and the men and children in their lives, but most people don't see that because it usually looks different than when men do it. \\n\\nI hear a lot of things in your words that show you believe everyone should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their sex or gender or ethnicity or culture. I also hear a fear of men's sexuality more than women's. I know that women get aroused and think of sex in some form as much as men, but our society has come to celebrate women expressing their sexuality and condemning men's. This is abhorrent! It teaches men (and boys) to be ashamed of themselves for having normal feelings and having their bodies react to those feelings. It forces them to explore their sexuality in secret, and in ways that will hurt them on at least some level. It won't turn them into rapists, because most men (boys) don't feel that way about others, but it will hurt them.\\n\\nSociety, and most of the individuals that make it up, expect men (boys) to always protect others. They ignore it when men (boys) need that protection from others. It is unrealistic to expect men (boys) to always be protectors, and when we fail at it for whatever reason, it ruins who we are. It forces women into victim roles more often, because they are taught that they are helpless without the protection of men! Most women are far from helpless! It is women's responsibility to protect others from abuse just as much as men! It is women's responsibility to get consent for touch just as much as men! You did say that a mother should respect her child's desire to be touched or not, which is unusual, and thrills me! But a great deal of what you said places responsibility on men for keeping their sexuality out of everyday life when they interact with others but never addresses women's responsibility for the same. I suspect this is because you are talking about the abuses by a specific man who just lost his power. I suspect in your everyday life, as situations occur, you treat your kids with love and respect. I hope you, and more so anyone who reads this, considers their boys and girls sexuality, and feelings in general, as equal in value, and deserving of expression without guilt or shame!",1,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"This birth coach, #Intactivist and former medical professional, is open to dialogue, but wants to remind you that #BritShalom is not just for girls, and would be glad to lend you one of her copies of the book, Brit Shalom.

WFb0EDl-JS8,I dunno. ¬†You basically say all porn is abusive. ¬†But there are people who write porn. Nobody's being abused in that creative outlet. And you say strip clubs are bad. Some people feel powerful taking off their clothes. I think your conservatism is making you talk about things you know little to nothing about.,1,0
WFb0EDl-JS8,"I'm sure this is not the same way as it is for many other people, but for me ingesting pornography is either doing little or doing a lot of good for my relationship with women.\\n\\nI think the most important thing to understand about pornography is that it isn't real. The situations are oversexualized, the body types are oversexualized, and the people involved are experienced. If you want to have a relationship with a real girl, you have to accept that they might be uglier on the outside than the girls in pornography, they might be more shy or more uncomfortable with the prospect of sex than the girls in pornography, and they might either be too inexperienced for you or be experienced to the point of not feeling much from you.\\n\\nHowever, though this can lead some people who don't think about the constructed nature of porn down a road of sexual deviancy, I believe that it also can stop people from taking drastic measures to deal with their sexual urges. If I didn't have pornography to relieve myself, I don't know what would happen. Would I be the same? Would I try to force relationships with women who aren't ready or even rape someone? Would I end up like the guy who started a school shooting because he believed girls should be attracted to him and that life was unfair? \\n\\nIs it the same in the opposite direction? Would I feel little to no libido as I gradually adjust to not having sex and not relieving myself? Would this hurt my relationships with women in the opposite direction, if she was ready and I was not?\\n\\nI believe that if pornography was a purely negative thing it would probably get pushed to the dark web, restricted by governments by some form of legal measures. If you are worried that your sons will learn the wrong message from it, just teach them not to misunderstand or abuse it.",0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"The Destruction of the Constitution of the United States of America.\\nWhen you try to conquer a people wether in Roman times or today. To successfully integrate a people and keep them from rebelling, you have to destroy their existing society totally and completely. In Rome when the Emperor wanted to keep the people from learning, he burned the Great Library of Alexandria. In America our corrupt government dangles cash in front of schools for infrastructure. As long as they only teach certain things. Common Core replacing real math is just an example.\\nNext you take away the language of the indigenous people. In America our nation language was english, but now when you dial 911 remember to push 1 for english. You also need to take away the peoples traditions and culture. How many of us now have children, that don't know the Pledge of Allegiance? How many years have past since it was last spoken in school?\\nNow we stand by and watch as land marks are stripped away. From Plymouth Massachusetts where over priced condos block out the average people. To the Was museum thats been turned into another condo. In the South they have lost their southern flag and statues of General Lee.

WFb0EDl-JS8,"Your video is exactly why there is a rape hysteria culture on college campuses. We raised our sons to be respectful etc.  The problem is that there are young women out there who feel they can destroy young mens' lives on a whim and file Title IX sexual misconduct complaints with their universities.  Since the 2011 and 2014 Dear Colleague Letters, hundreds of young mens' lives have been intentionally destroyed by young women who file false complaints against the young men.  Why?  Well, because they had sex with someone behind their boyfriends backand then told their boyfriend that they were raped.  Or, because the girl is jealous that a guy is dating this person instead of her.  Or, because the guy did something non-sexual related to her (eg his suggestion outshone hers.  Or.......if you can think of it, it has been alledged against college males.  College males whose college careers are destroyed because there are ZERO universities out there who want anything other than to report numbers to the Department of Education.  Public and private universities don't give the accused due process.  They don't give those innocent sons any help. Sons lose their scholarships, proceedings extend through school years and break the souls of these young men.  At least one committed suicide because of a false allegation.  Many others have been suspended for semesters/years from colleges, with a larger number being expelled from college.  Their transcripts are marked.  No other colleges will take them.  They fall into dispair, with their parents doing everything to try to save them, save some part of their future, hire attorneys (if they can afford them), to fight the college.  Those with money have been filing cases in federal district courts, where Article III judges (real judges vs the kangaroo courts of colleges) have been ruling in the accused favor, particularly after the young women admits on the stand that she lied about the whole thing.  You put up a video re how to raise young men.  You need to put up a video for those with daughters and tell them that they have a responsibility to be truthful and honest and not make false allegations.  \\nNow, there have been and probably always be, unfortunately, cases of actual rape and assault.  In cases of any kind of sexual assault, those cases must no longer be handled by campus police, where evidence is lost, text messages are disregarded, and Title IX staff are inept (along with Deans of Students) to handle actual criminal violations.  And, unbelievably, where actual police and the criminal justice mechanism HAS been used and has found the young men not guilty or not enough evidence, universities STILL have been going forward with kicking the young men out of colleges.  \\nHonesty, fairness, due process is for EVERYONE.  It is not logical to always believe the accuser.  If you do that, the accused then becomes a victim.  If you think that way, then you believe that everyone is guilty until proven innocent.  This is not the basis of what our country stands for.

WFb0EDl-JS8,"I generally agree with what she's saying in terms of behaviors except one fundamental thing- everyone being virtually the same is very different from being the same; as virtual reality is very different from reality. This slight fundamental difference means that people have inherent differences that need to be considered prior to your interaction with them, etc... One more thing, as we have learned from the Weinstein chronicles , as I call them, some people were extremely vocal about saying no and that they aren't comfortable while others weren't, this leads to a problem because we are not yet equipped to read people's minds. For example, an actress/actor may be willing (though not excited) to have a relationship with a director thinking they'll get a great role and then once that role falls through suddenly they believe they were taken advantage of and so on- consent isn't an easy subject because it can be given initially just to be rescinded post factum which makes the situation hard to prove. Finally, i am raising my boys to be afraid of women, because if you don't you will most certainly find yourself in a situation where it's a she said vs he said situation. Just my two cents.",0,0
WFb0EDl-JS8,"Mayim, I love this video and the message you try to convey in it. However, I believe that many of the choices in regards to diction in this video come from a place of ignorance, thus unfortunately harming your message. The issues of sexual violence are not inherently patriarchal. Biological women are just as likely as biological men to experience strong levels of sexual attraction. Yes, those with higher levels of testosterone (i.e. biosex males) have a tendency to be more aggressive, but the approach taken in this video that boys in particular are likely to grow up to become sexually aggressive is a bit problematic for a few reasons:\\n\\n-It dismisses the equal likelihood of women to experience strong sex drives, invalidating female sexual expression\\n\\n-It assumes that all men experience sexual attraction, excluding the many people of all genders who are asexual or sex-repulsed.\\n\\n-It asserts that women and girls are the victims of rape, assault, and abuse, dismissing the experiences of male, intersex, and nonbinary victims\\n\\n\\nI thoroughly appreciate your being so brave and caring as to make this video and convey such an important message. That being said, some of these small mistakes seem to have been off-putting to many, preventing them from being perceptive to the responsible, constructive, and positive message of this video. Though I know you mean no harm, of course, many others may not. Subsequently, it‚Äôs important to keep in mind that no one shares the exact same experiences or knowledge. Considering this may help those who truly need to hear it be receptive to what you have to say.\\n\\nBest wishes!",0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"I think the main problem here is that women just don't understand what sexuality is like for men. It seems as though many women believe that they're normal and men aren't. It isn't something men can control, it's a biological NEED that that our bodies create to ensure that our genes are spread, it's not something we can control. Think about it, women can get sex virtually whenever they want, they don't even really have to be pretty, this leaves them satisfied and happy, however it is NOT the same for guys, so when men who are REALLY sexually charged can't have sex, it often leaves them sexually frustrated and angry, leading to rapists and creeps. I'm not saying rapists are justified or that men are owed sex, I'm just saying that instead of alienating these men and treating them like freaks, we should try to help them cope in different ways, and women need to remember that it takes a lot for men to control themselves sometimes, so try to be empathetic.",0,0
WFb0EDl-JS8,"You made a great video. I like the way you think. I'm with you. I just want to interject a distinction on your blanket use of patriarchy. The way I heard it in this video is: All patriarchy is bad and will only end in male power crushing women and underrepresented minority groups under its heel. That's not a quote, obviously. But by not defining what you mean by patriarchy, you imply that patriarchy by its design will only lead to bad or is something to be thwarted by society. I really think it would be more helpful in the long run for people to understand that there is a big difference between the Wise King and the Tyrannical Father, which are the positive and/or negative sides of the male archetype. Just as there is a big difference between the Queen/Mother and a Cruel and Distant Mother who eats her young. There is good and bad in both patriarchy and matriarchy. I hope we are not confusing general audiences with a simplistic social idea and movement that all patriarchy is bad and all matriarchy is good. Aside from that, awesome and good boys are growing into awesome and good men everywhere, and will continue to do so in spite of men like Harvey Weinstein or Bill Cosby.

Also, as a woman who was sexually abused by another woman as a child, while statistics do show that men are more likely to perpetrate these crimes, it's important to stop portraying all men as only potential perpetrators, and all women as only potential victims. The things we teach our boys should be the same as the things we teach our girls (and vice versa). This ideology is harmful to both men and women alike, and is currently one of the motivating forces driving people away from the feminist movement. I genuinely believe that this specific way of thinking needs to be revised for feminism to move forward into the future.",1,1

Does that make him the GOAT, it's tough to say cuz Anderson Silva pre-injury and steroids was a dominant fighter against what seemed to be tougher competition compared to DJ's competition. I remember watching fights where he made legends look bad and he seemed untouchable. Yet with the term GREATEST, it's hard to argue with the record for title defenses, beating everyone in your weight class, and you seem to be unstoppable. The guys DJ fought are also well trained and skilled competition. Maybe their names aren't as well known or as popular as other past fighters but that doesn't mean they're not good.

qCH73iQAZS4,i agree I think DJ is one of the best of all time. unfortunately he's going to need to beat someone with a legacy to cement his legendary status. if he beats tj or Cody (or both) there will be no doubt in my mind that he's the #1 p4p fighter of all time. until he beats a legend - he can't be a legend. ray borg is good for a #1 contender but when you look at other weight classes he is nowhere near some of the other guys at that rank. i personally think the LW and LHW are stacked with talent and potential champions. well the only clear talent in the flyweight division is DJ. same thing for Joanna in the strawweight division. namajunas is very talented but if she's the best contender for Joanna it just shows the skill Gap in the division. set up a super fight with DJ fighting the winner of TJ vs garbrandt,0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"something you didn't mention: if you're raising boys with a husband, you guys have to be on the same page. dad and other male peers can undo your teachings about these matters very easily. i would bet money that harvey didn't come from a broken home and his parents were nice people, so there really is a bit more to it. harvey shares a lot of the same values you do--politically at least. i bet his mom taught him many of the things on your list. this is very simplistic.",0,0

How about blaming mothers for being abusive and creating the oppressive environment that causes young kids to be developed into hating women because of their dictatorial mother.

Talk about misleading signals. Bitches always blame the man for being a man. Where's the tolerance? Testostrone makes us more aggressive, confident, competitive and there's nothing we do about it.

Fuck women they, are stupid cunts!",0,0
WFb0EDl-JS8,"One important thing about how boys and girls learn to respect the opposite sex, from young age is by example in the home. If the family unit is dysfunctional (which in today's society very few are growing up in a non-dysfunctional family), no matter the amount of learning a kid gets, most will grow up and be just like their parents with some that will not fall in to the same cycle (good or bad), but many will. The irony is that the traditional two parent family is looked at as some sort of threat and raising a boy to respect a female and be abstinent and for a girl to stay abstinent is like some sort of an alien idea from the stone ages. Yet in general the secular society preaches to be free, careless and do what makes you happy, but when time comes to pay up for that careless way of life, people are looking for a way out without wanting to face consequences for their actions, as in the case of Harvey and many many others that are in the position of power and lots of money or even regular folks. Until people will realize that a society does need rules and boundaries, the whole notion of I can do what I want as long as it makes me happy is just a lie that is backfiring faster then a bullet on Hollywood and the the whole elite and rich people in power. In the end people are desperately in need of God and His gift of salvation as most are hanging of a cliff of death holding on by a string that is about to snap, but yet when someone is offering a solution and a helping hand, many are refusing to grab on to it. Just my two cents. You make a lot of great point Mayim, Blessing to your family.",0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,This video is great. Well needed.\nBut I do think that what you said in the beginning about most men being sexually motivated needs to be discussed. It is clear that the patriarchy judges a man based on how strong his (hetero-) sexual drive is. And so we cannot play into the patriarchy's hands and say  that men are naturally more libido driven. That is harmful.,0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"I enjoy watching your commentaries,  you are very insightful, but like many women in modern first world societies  much of your view completely disregards the natural laws of biology. Many women today see men as the week, emasculated, effeminate metrosexuals  that popular media wishes to portray men to be. I don't wish to dispute that society is evolving and that many of the truths' we used to hold have changed. But here is one that hasn't, can't and never will. Men (population) are bigger and stronger than women, they have different hormones circulating in the bodies and have different genitalia. No societal construct will ever change the biology of the species, no social engineering will ever allow a 45kg woman to pickup a fallen 115kg man on the battlefield and carry him to safety, no gender diversity directions will give a 45kg woman the upper body and forearm strength to pickup and operate the jaws of life or steel cutter to rescue people trapped in wreckage or building fires. Men and Women are physically different, period. Please, I accept the host of good changes that equal rights bring, but lets stop kidding ourselves and start acknowledging basic biological truth.

WFb0EDl-JS8,"This illustrates so much about points where modern-day feminism has completely jumped the shark and simply does not speak to me as a woman.  \\n\\nFirst, to assume all men are motivated by nothing more than sex is ridiculous.  Look to the men in your life who mean the most to you, and you ought to know that's not true.  At least, not unless all of the men in your life are vapid, one-dimensional characters.  \\n\\nSecond, are you as a woman not interested in sex?  Because I am, and clearly so many others are. \\n\\nThird, Harvey Weinstein and his ilk are the exception and not the norm. \\n\\nFourth, I agreed with most of your bullet points, except those parts about strip clubs and pornography.  I'm assuming you hold those views because you're religious. Otherwise, those are simply forms of entertainment that I'd prefer to educate people on than ban altogether.   \\n\\nFifth, here's what was missing from your video and is where feminism today is sorely lacking. Sexual freedom means sexual responsibility.  And that means you don't put yourself in certain situations unless you understand the possibilities and consequences.  So many of the women involved in this scandal come off as incredibly stupid... you went up to this man's hotel room alone?  Fucking stupid.  I'm not saying they deserved what they got... a woman should be able to stand buck naked in front of man, and he ought to have enough self-control to not assault her.  However, recognizing that there are evil people out there, why make yourself an easy target?  \\n\\nAnd do you know why this took so long to come out?  Because so many of these idiotic women were too afraid to report it because they were hoping to get something out of this asshole and his company.  I feel compassion for these women, but until we acknowledge the mistakes they made, rather than see them solely as victims, we are not going to move forward in this.  We need to educate girls and young women about their sexual freedom and the responsibility that comes with it. There is audio from 2015 of a model who was apparently assaulted by Weinstein and who subsequently approached him a second time while wearing a wire.  Everyone, especially women, should listen to that audio.  He sounds desperate and ridiculous, pleading with her and pleading with her.  If that's how he acted with all of those other women, it should have been relatively simple to realize, Oops, I fucked up by coming up to his room alone, tell him to fuck off, and then get the hell out of dodge.",0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"I'll tell you what you should be teaching your boys.  Teach them about the way that women will use them as human ATM's, teach them how women will never really love them but pretend to love them for his resources. Teach them that women will lie and use false rape accusations against them when they don't get their way. Teach your boys that women will lie about everything they talk about. Teach them that the local and state and the federal, family courts are fixed to make sure you don't get a fair trial and so that women will most of the time be able to legally rob them of everything they've worked hard for to provide for a thankless, never happy, selfish, self hating, who pretends to love and care about them but has no empathy or love for them. Teach them that women will get angry and violent and hit  and kick  you and throw things at you or try to run you over with their cars and you are not allowed to protect yourself or you will go to jail and the woman won't but she'll be able to live in your house until it becomes hers legally.\\n Teach them that a woman will never be happy or content with anything they do even if its exactly what the woman said to do it. Teach them that they will need to find somewhere to go if they get physically abused by a woman because there are no shelters for battered husbands\\n If you try to get help from a shelter for battered women, they will tell them they don't serve their kind and will tell them to man up and probably call the cops on you for trespassing or harassment.\\n   Teach them that women are equal to men in the sense that they are human, or part human, and that they breath air and they shit and piss other then those things women are not ever going to be eqaul to men in any other way. It's ridiculous to think that is at all possible.  Women are not men and men are not women. Period.  \\n   Teach your boys how to spot a gold digging liar. They are the ones with vaginas.\\n   Teach them about gynocentricism, and feminists who won't shut the fuck up and who hates men and wants to destroy men's lives worse then they already have. Teach them that men didn't invent or teach other men to hate women and men didn't  create patriarchy, that is something women created to complain about because their lives were made so easy and had too much spare time during the day because of all the modern conveniences that men invented and created for women to make the old household chores simple such as the dishwasher, the clothes washing machine, the dryer the self cleaning oven, the microwave etc... all so she could have time to expand their minds and appreciate and question and learn about the world. But women didn't want to spend their new free time learning or having intellectual conversations the way men do, they want to spend that free time spending their man's money on themselves and sleeping with the Neighbor or her friend from work.\\n    That's enough for now\\n Remember, ask yourself if you would want any woman to treat your boys the way women treat men? Seriously, think about how much shit women do and get away with because they are women think about how unfairly men are treated. There has been a 20% increase in male suicides since 1960 and a 40% since 1990. Suicide among women has been stable or decreased. More men get abused by their spouses than women 70% goes unreported and of the 30% reported only 2% of that are ever prosecuted and most are never given jail time or even sentenced. \\n  Teach your boys the truth and keep them safe from women.  If you are able to have a moment of honest, rational, concern for your boys well being, mental, emotional and physical then you need to be open and honest about women and society in general and how they will be strictly thought of as providers and everyone except them has rights and gets help when needed but only men get nothing for doing everything. Teach them how women are trying to eliminate Father's Day because Fathers aren't important enough to be recognized and appreciated for their hard work and keeping a roof over our heads and food on the table and protection against bad people. \\n   Don't forget, teach your boys to be men not femimen or manginas.",0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"I'm sure this is not the same way as it is for many other people, but for me ingesting pornography is either doing little or doing a lot of good for my relationship with women.\\n\\nI think the most important thing to understand about pornography is that it isn't real. The situations are oversexualized, the body types are oversexualized, and the people involved are experienced. If you want to have a relationship with a real girl, you have to accept that they might be uglier on the outside than the girls in pornography, they might be more shy or more uncomfortable with the prospect of sex than the girls in pornography, and they might either be too inexperienced for you or be experienced to the point of not feeling much from you.\\n\\nHowever, though this can lead some people who don't think about the constructed nature of porn down a road of sexual deviancy, I believe that it also can stop people from taking drastic measures to deal with their sexual urges. If I didn't have pornography to relieve myself, I don't know what would happen. Would I be the same? Would I try to force relationships with women who aren't ready or even rape someone? Would I end up like the guy who started a school shooting because he believed girls should be attracted to him and that life was unfair? \\n\\nIs it the same in the opposite direction? Would I feel little to no libido as I gradually adjust to not having sex and not relieving myself? Would this hurt my relationships with women in the opposite direction, if she was ready and I was not?\\n\\nI believe that if pornography was a purely negative thing it would probably get pushed to the dark web, restricted by governments by some form of legal measures. If you are worried that your sons will learn the wrong message from it, just teach them not to misunderstand or abuse it.",0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"Your video is exactly why there is a rape hysteria culture on college campuses. We raised our sons to be respectful etc.  The problem is that there are young women out there who feel they can destroy young mens' lives on a whim and file Title IX sexual misconduct complaints with their universities.  Since the 2011 and 2014 Dear Colleague Letters, hundreds of young mens' lives have been intentionally destroyed by young women who file false complaints against the young men.  Why?  Well, because they had sex with someone behind their boyfriends backand then told their boyfriend that they were raped.  Or, because the girl is jealous that a guy is dating this person instead of her.  Or, because the guy did something non-sexual related to her (eg his suggestion outshone hers.  Or.......if you can think of it, it has been alledged against college males.  College males whose college careers are destroyed because there are ZERO universities out there who want anything other than to report numbers to the Department of Education.  Public and private universities don't give the accused due process.  They don't give those innocent sons any help. Sons lose their scholarships, proceedings extend through school years and break the souls of these young men.  At least one committed suicide because of a false allegation.  Many others have been suspended for semesters/years from colleges, with a larger number being expelled from college.  Their transcripts are marked.  No other colleges will take them.  They fall into dispair, with their parents doing everything to try to save them, save some part of their future, hire attorneys (if they can afford them), to fight the college.  Those with money have been filing cases in federal district courts, where Article III judges (real judges vs the kangaroo courts of colleges) have been ruling in the accused favor, particularly after the young women admits on the stand that she lied about the whole thing.  You put up a video re how to raise young men.  You need to put up a video for those with daughters and tell them that they have a responsibility to be truthful and honest and not make false allegations.  \\nNow, there have been and probably always be, unfortunately, cases of actual rape and assault.  In cases of any kind of sexual assault, those cases must no longer be handled by campus police, where evidence is lost, text messages are disregarded, and Title IX staff are inept (along with Deans of Students) to handle actual criminal violations.  And, unbelievably, where actual police and the criminal justice mechanism HAS been used and has found the young men not guilty or not enough evidence, universities STILL have been going forward with kicking the young men out of colleges.  \\nHonesty, fairness, due process is for EVERYONE.  It is not logical to always believe the accuser.  If you do that, the accused then becomes a victim.  If you think that way, then you believe that everyone is guilty until proven innocent.  This is not the basis of what our country stands for.

WFb0EDl-JS8,"I understand your outrage about the Hollywood institution of exploitation.  I feel the same way about any person or agency of power. I was also taught that men would do anything for sex, first by my father, and members of my mother's extended family, raping me off and on from age 2 to13, and then by a Xian cult religion. From the time I was in puberty, most of the women in my family, and life, treated me like I was about to rape them all the time. This screwed me up just as much as the sexual abuse forced on me by men! It is a psychological sexual abuse rather than a physical one, but just as damaging! I hated myself because I was male, and tried until I was 36 to be a sexless woman so my extended family would love me!\\n\\nI've learned through 20+ years of healing, that most men would NEVER intentionally hurt anyone with their sexuality! It took looking at people's behavior more objectively and comparing it to my conditioning and finding that more often, men were just as likely as women to be loving and kind and nurturing. It took me a long time to believe that truth! I also found that women were just as likely to abuse themselves and the men and children in their lives, but most people don't see that because it usually looks different than when men do it. \\n\\nI hear a lot of things in your words that show you believe everyone should be treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their sex or gender or ethnicity or culture. I also hear a fear of men's sexuality more than women's. I know that women get aroused and think of sex in some form as much as men, but our society has come to celebrate women expressing their sexuality and condemning men's. This is abhorrent! It teaches men (and boys) to be ashamed of themselves for having normal feelings and having their bodies react to those feelings. It forces them to explore their sexuality in secret, and in ways that will hurt them on at least some level. It won't turn them into rapists, because most men (boys) don't feel that way about others, but it will hurt them.\\n\\nSociety, and most of the individuals that make it up, expect men (boys) to always protect others. They ignore it when men (boys) need that protection from others. It is unrealistic to expect men (boys) to always be protectors, and when we fail at it for whatever reason, it ruins who we are. It forces women into victim roles more often, because they are taught that they are helpless without the protection of men! Most women are far from helpless! It is women's responsibility to protect others from abuse just as much as men! It is women's responsibility to get consent for touch just as much as men! You did say that a mother should respect her child's desire to be touched or not, which is unusual, and thrills me! But a great deal of what you said places responsibility on men for keeping their sexuality out of everyday life when they interact with others but never addresses women's responsibility for the same. I suspect this is because you are talking about the abuses by a specific man who just lost his power. I suspect in your everyday life, as situations occur, you treat your kids with love and respect. I hope you, and more so anyone who reads this, considers their boys and girls sexuality, and feelings in general, as equal in value, and deserving of expression without guilt or shame!",1,0

And that simply isn't true. Our human minds are nuanced by our nature, but can very easily (in many aspects) be overridden by our education. Also, as a woman who was sexually abused by another woman as a child, while statistics do show that men are more likely to perpetrate these crimes, it's important to stop portraying all men as only potential perpetrators, and all women as only potential victims. The things we teach our boys should be the same as the things we teach our girls (and vice versa). This ideology is harmful to both men and women alike, and is currently one of the motivating forces driving people away from the feminist movement. I genuinely believe that this specific way of thinking needs to be revised for feminism to move forward into the future.",2,1

I use sulfate  free shampoo and it doesn't strip my  hair of colour (maybe i'm wrong for saying that in this context but i'm talking from  the heart and what came in to my mind from the outset. The vid reminds of Michael Jacksons Black or White video so I get it in a way. It's Black history month  people it's like me putting out something about hitler when it's a jewish holiday.

You‚Äôre a feminist which means you should see all women as equal there are no perfect 10‚Äôs because a woman isn‚Äôt a prized pig at a country farm. I understand that in your mind taking certain precautions to avoid assault may seem obvious. However,We have to balance as a civilized society the ideal that while no one should drunkenly walk home dressed provocatively it doesn‚Äôt equate to rape as a deserved outcome.

To me, Harvey Weinstein is neither beast nor beauty; he is a man in an industry that does a lot of social climbing over bodies to succeed where the first rule of fight club is: LOOK AT ME NO MATTER WHAT--oh was I lying? *sorry* Got your attention though, didn't I?\\n\\nLogic is not always necessary; neither is talent or merit. Sometimes ruthless, status seeking sorts end up on top, no matter what people tell you how it's SUPPOSED to work. In real life, a LOT of businesses in our surface-as-deep culture behave like this. I'm living in it; I know this truth to be self-evident. Why would I be shocked?\\n\\nAnd I imagine Weinstein will WIN in some way, whether people fob him off or not. Good or bad, it's all publicity!\\n\\nAnd another thing: Harvey didn't start the fire. But a lotta liberals seem to have tied their trucks to Harvey and are seeing how much MILEAGE they can get out of this. Crap!\\n\\nThe first thing I thought when I heard about this was: 1. Is Harvey being hassled about a business deal he may be winning in some way, and this is how someone reacted to him by pulling a scandal out of their back pocket? 2. Is Harvey Weinstein no longer pulling in the numbers and someone saw him as an easy target; a target, in fact, to add to the 'to do list/watch me' list of a lot of the Hollywood liberals who seek to stay in power in some way. *sigh*\\n\\nSo much drama. My heart.\\n\\nI was reading a newspaper and noticed more 'actresses' were coming to the microphone to speak. Being as I've dealt with this, with Trump and way back, Bill Clinton, and now this whole illiberal thing, (sorry, I have issues with anyone being irrational about anything and a lot of liberals are doing that, right this minute) something occurred to me:\\n\\nAre these actors AUDITIONING for jobs here? I don't mean Mayim. I mean the actors in Hollywood seeking some kind of status.\\n\\nCreating scandal and then jumping on the marketing cycle. Hm\\n\\nGo Mayim. I agree with what you're saying here. Even the behaviour on the part of people being harassed by Bill Clinton? I'm sorry: you OPEN YOUR MOUTH AND SAY SOMETHING. Right then; at the time. Have you so little self-respect?

My bestfriend, a modest looking young woman with many acne in her face, was sexually assaulted two times in college. \\nClothes don't make people look or be modest. Clothes do NOT protect women and girls from rape and sexual assault. Instead of telling women what to wear and what not, we need to teach men and boys NOT to rape and NOT to sexually assault people.\\nYour article was ignorant and stupid at this one point, when you said women should make wise choices. So women should stay at home, like in a prison, and not marry, so to avoid rape and sexual assault? Why punishing the innocent? Shouldn't creeps like weinstein stay looked up? Shouldn't men as sick as him stay at home, so that they don't sexually assault?\\nYour article does imply another thing: that men are animals who just can't control their dick. But there is this fact: Rape is a choice. Sexual assault is a choice.*Some* men do it because they know they probably will get away with it, just like the >96 of rapists who will never be jailed for their barbaric crime, often due to lack of proof.\\nSexual assault.

I believe that the nurturing of any child, through the phases of childhood and adolescence almost always results in thoughtful, self aware individuals who although certainly not perfect, will have a degree of common sense and empathy for others. And that can only be a good thing for all of us ultimately.\\n\\nYour focus is your boys understandably but I do feel it's important for us to recognise that the victim and the perpetrator in these sorts of situations is not always immediately evident and not always mutually exclusive. Harvey Weinstein has behaved reprehensibly that's without question. But what about all those who have been complicit in keeping this all under the carpet for so long, both men and women. For me they are just as if not more guilty. As this story has broken I've seen high profile actresses come forward, some from very established Hollywood dynasties and arguably with a good deal of power behind them. They have been content for years in benefiting through his projects even after the alleged transgressions and now decide to jump on the proverbial band wagon. It's all very self serving as far as I'm concerned. \\n\\nI think as a society we can be quite unfair to boys and men sometimes. Most men I know are decent and not slaves to their sexual urges. By the same token, there are women who use their sexuality in a very calculated way to suit their agenda.

WFb0EDl-JS8,"One important thing about how boys and girls learn to respect the opposite sex, from young age is by example in the home. If the family unit is dysfunctional (which in today's society very few are growing up in a non-dysfunctional family), no matter the amount of learning a kid gets, most will grow up and be just like their parents with some that will not fall in to the same cycle (good or bad), but many will. The irony is that the traditional two parent family is looked at as some sort of threat and raising a boy to respect a female and be abstinent and for a girl to stay abstinent is like some sort of an alien idea from the stone ages. Yet in general the secular society preaches to be free, careless and do what makes you happy, but when time comes to pay up for that careless way of life, people are looking for a way out without wanting to face consequences for their actions, as in the case of Harvey and many many others that are in the position of power and lots of money or even regular folks. Until people will realize that a society does need rules and boundaries, the whole notion of I can do what I want as long as it makes me happy is just a lie that is backfiring faster then a bullet on Hollywood and the the whole elite and rich people in power. In the end people are desperately in need of God and His gift of salvation as most are hanging of a cliff of death holding on by a string that is about to snap, but yet when someone is offering a solution and a helping hand, many are refusing to grab on to it.

Teach them that the local and state and the federal, family courts are fixed to make sure you don't get a fair trial and so that women will most of the time be able to legally rob them of everything they've worked hard for to provide for a thankless, never happy, selfish, self hating, who pretends to love and care about them but has no empathy or love for them. Teach them that women will get angry and violent and hit  and kick  you and throw things at you or try to run you over with their cars and you are not allowed to protect yourself or you will go to jail and the woman won't but she'll be able to live in your house until it becomes hers legally.\\n Teach them that a woman will never be happy or content with anything they do even if its exactly what the woman said to do it. Teach them that they will need to find somewhere to go if they get physically abused by a woman because there are no shelters for battered husbands\\n If you try to get help from a shelter for battered women, they will tell them they don't serve their kind and will tell them to man up and probably call the cops on you for trespassing or harassment.\\n   Teach them that women are equal to men in the sense that they are human, or part human, and that they breath air and they shit and piss other then those things women are not ever going to be eqaul to men in any other way. It's ridiculous to think that is at all possible.  Women are not men and men are not women. Period.  \\n   Teach your boys how to spot a gold digging liar. They are the ones with vaginas.\\n   Teach them about gynocentricism, and feminists who won't shut the fuck up and who hates men and wants to destroy men's lives worse then they already have. Teach them that men didn't invent or teach other men to hate women and men didn't  create patriarchy, that is something women created to complain about because their lives were made so easy and had too much spare time during the day because of all the modern conveniences that men invented and created for women to make the old household chores simple such as the dishwasher, the clothes washing machine, the dryer the self cleaning oven, the microwave etc... all so she could have time to expand their minds and appreciate and question and learn about the world. But women didn't want to spend their new free time learning or having intellectual conversations the way men do, they want to spend that free time spending their man's money on themselves and sleeping with the Neighbor or her friend from work.\\n    That's enough for now\\n Remember, ask yourself if you would want any woman to treat your boys the way women treat men? Seriously, think about how much shit women do and get away with because they are women think about how unfairly men are treated. There has been a 20% increase in male suicides since 1960 and a 40% since 1990. Suicide among women has been stable or decreased. More men get abused by their spouses than women 70% goes unreported and of the 30% reported only 2% of that are ever prosecuted and most are never given jail time or even sentenced. \\n  Teach your boys the truth and keep them safe from women.  If you are able to have a moment of honest, rational, concern for your boys well being, mental, emotional and physical then you need to be open and honest about women and society in general and how they will be strictly thought of as providers and everyone except them has rights and gets help when needed but only men get nothing for doing everything. Teach them how women are trying to eliminate Father's Day because Fathers aren't important enough to be recognized and appreciated for their hard work and keeping a roof over our heads and food on the table and protection against bad people. \\n   Don't forget, teach your boys to be men not femimen or manginas.",0,0

Investigators were told that Capt Graf repeatedly called her senior staff idiots and told one officer on the bridge: Take your God-damned attitude and shove it up your ass and leave it there.

Racism is still a touchy subject and people don't forget we know that things are not equal if you know the truth. Even if that wasn't the intention of the video. I use sulfate  free shampoo and it doesn't strip my  hair of colour (maybe i'm wrong for saying that in this context but i'm talking from  the heart and what came in to my mind from the outset. The vid reminds of Michael Jacksons Black or White video so I get it in a way. It's Black history month  people it's like me putting out something about hitler when it's a jewish holiday.

But then to see the white woman turning into the third woman (I'm bad at judging ethnicity but she seems to be Hispanic?) just cements for me that it doesn't come close to being racist.

I wanted to get to know each other before having sex and he was completely okay with that. when we started having sex he completely changed personality, I was very upset because I noticed he was detached from me suddenly, and he even mentioned that he did not consider us a couple. As we were dating for about 2 months I was really upset. we had a talk and he told me that he was forced into intercourses by his first girlfriend, that he faked sexual arousal and orgasms to get rid of her, that he felt that he could not say no, because he was a guy and guys wanted to have sex all the time. I was floored because I thought so too. I was scared of hurting him even more, I had to forget all I thought I knew and learn it all, trust him to teach me. It took a long time, but I thank him for this lesson.",0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"Thanks for this, Ms. Bialik. I very much appreciate your message. I would only add that for me it is subtler than 'we are all equal'. In the most important sense yes, we are all equal. But, as you imply in the beginning, men are indeed different (on average) in their behavioral tendencies. Some of these are perhaps to the good, but others require active civilizing. That is the process you are describing in your 7 point plan, but I think it requires a more explicit acknowledgement that there are many (most?) of us who have natural tendencies that require tempering. It makes the process more difficult but more honest and hopefully more effective: the compassion in the statement I know you have these hormonal or psychological urges but here is why they might be destructive and here is how they can be better channeled makes it more effective. I think.\\n\\nI do believe it is not only possible but necessary to reconcile treating everyone as a respected individual while acknowledging different tendencies in boys and girls. As the dad of a boy and two girls I can tell you that they sure are different from each other, and the boy is different from the girls in different ways. They require slightly different applications of the same civilizing principles of compassion and respect.\\n\\nWhich leads me to my one quibble with your excellent talk: the identitarian list.  I understand the historical need for support for marginalized individuals. But they are just that: *individuals* who have been marginalized because of some social status or construct. I think there is some point -- perhaps, debatedly, not yet reached, but some point -- at which automatically collecting them in groups, and reciting the religious litany of identity actually harms their individuality more than it supports their struggle. Group think can be the enemy of compassion. Thus Spielberg's red coated girl in Schindler's list, and thus the fact that my son is * very * different from my daughters, but my daughters also have unique gifts and challenges. Automated identity lists can get in the way.\\n\\nMy own answer to the extremely important question you raise how not to raise children who are monsters has led me, like you, to try to find ways to communicate universal principles and then help manage the unique messiness of applying them to growing souls. (First the entire Talmud on one foot, but then the entire Talmud, as it were . . .)\\n\\nIn this regard, I think, demonstrating and modeling and discussing the details of compassion and kindness is the best medicine. It acknowledges urges, and it encourages respect and love of individuals.\\n\\nI really always used to laugh at the BuJews, but I seem to have become one . . . \\n\\nThank you again.

You may have the purest intentions and try as hard as you can, every single day to give your children good lessons, but you can never know for sure how will that kid grow up. He/She may have some different experiences that you have told him it's the normal thing to have or bad influences and make bad decisions. I believe that good parenting for the parents and immediate family perspective is a very, very important step to raise not only good men / good women but, good people in general.

Is Harvey being hassled about a business deal he may be winning in some way, and this is how someone reacted to him by pulling a scandal out of their back pocket? 2.

Clothes do NOT protect women and girls from rape and sexual assault.

For me they are just as if not more guilty. As this story has broken I've seen high profile actresses come forward, some from very established Hollywood dynasties and arguably with a good deal of power behind them. They have been content for years in benefiting through his projects even after the alleged transgressions and now decide to jump on the proverbial band wagon. It's all very self serving as far as I'm concerned. \\n\\nI think as a society we can be quite unfair to boys and men sometimes. Most men I know are decent and not slaves to their sexual urges.

WFb0EDl-JS8,"One important thing about how boys and girls learn to respect the opposite sex, from young age is by example in the home. If the family unit is dysfunctional (which in today's society very few are growing up in a non-dysfunctional family), no matter the amount of learning a kid gets, most will grow up and be just like their parents with some that will not fall in to the same cycle (good or bad), but many will. The irony is that the traditional two parent family is looked at as some sort of threat and raising a boy to respect a female and be abstinent and for a girl to stay abstinent is like some sort of an alien idea from the stone ages. Yet in general the secular society preaches to be free, careless and do what makes you happy, but when time comes to pay up for that careless way of life, people are looking for a way out without wanting to face consequences for their actions, as in the case of Harvey and many many others that are in the position of power and lots of money or even regular folks. Until people will realize that a society does need rules and boundaries, the whole notion of I can do what I want as long as it makes me happy is just a lie that is backfiring faster then a bullet on Hollywood and the the whole elite and rich people in power. In the end people are desperately in need of God and His gift of salvation as most are hanging of a cliff of death holding on by a string that is about to snap, but yet when someone is offering a solution and a helping hand, many are refusing to grab on to it.

WFb0EDl-JS8,"I enjoy watching your commentaries,  you are very insightful, but like many women in modern first world societies  much of your view completely disregards the natural laws of biology. Many women today see men as the week, emasculated, effeminate metrosexuals  that popular media wishes to portray men to be. I don't wish to dispute that society is evolving and that many of the truths' we used to hold have changed. But here is one that hasn't, can't and never will. Men (population) are bigger and stronger than women, they have different hormones circulating in the bodies and have different genitalia. No societal construct will ever change the biology of the species, no social engineering will ever allow a 45kg woman to pickup a fallen 115kg man on the battlefield and carry him to safety, no gender diversity directions will give a 45kg woman the upper body and forearm strength to pickup and operate the jaws of life or steel cutter to rescue people trapped in wreckage or building fires. Men and Women are physically different, period. Please, I accept the host of good changes that equal rights bring, but lets stop kidding ourselves and start acknowledging basic biological truth. Men and women are not the same thing, they are men and they are women.",0,0

WFb0EDl-JS8,"From this post, you have demonstrated and exhibited through this entire process a true lack of moral clarity. This entire video is a bastardized version of yourself and a voice that you are projecting onto everyone else. There is so much dog whistling in this video. I suspect, this is your true self. I actually think that you are wearing a disguise and you secretly hate beautiful women. My sister is beautiful, dynamic, smart, strong, comfortable in her own skin. I‚Äôm proud of her tbh. She blooms with grace. Living and experiencing the bounty of life can never be experienced or realized in a straitjacket. You are a step back. Your words are contributing to a painful discord in our country. Then again, this is all about YOUR perfect record. So shallow and opportunistic. Like I said, you lack moral clarity. Do progress and humanity ¬†a favor, stop sharing your limited understanding of compassion. SHUT UP! Stop sharing your ugly. We all see it. You actually come across as hurt and rejected. Also, undesirable. Some how you have introduced yourself as a victim. This song is not about you.",1,25
WFb0EDl-JS8,"just read ur NY post, I'm disappointed ur as bias as old men are towards all women. U use your idea of ¬†'hollywood' beauty as a signifier for status and abuse and 'non hollywood' beauty as as signifier for morals and restraint. but they are not comparable items and i don't know what u were thinking. ur view point buys into the system ur trying to criticise but all ur criticising is women",1,0
WFb0EDl-JS8,"Mayim, I refuse to watch this video. So you make money off my watching this video. I just saw via Twitter your comments concerning your friend Harvey Weinstein. I was shocked and disappointed and disturbed by your comments regarding the comments of children and of actresses who have worked hard and had success even though they turned down your friends advances. I couldn't believe my eyes when I read that you said little girls who have and had more traditional pretty faces and soft voices and who were willing got preferential treatment are more likely to be raped. And women who dress according to style trends are also more likely to be raped. Saying that and that you haven't been raped because of the fact you dress conservative and are a good girl is so wrong. You haven't been raped because you were fortunate not to be. Rape has nothing to do with sex or physical appearance it has to do with power and control. I have read other comments why didn't they speak up sooner. Oh they dressed like sluts and agreed to meet him in his hotel room they deserved it. . It is because of comments like these that women don't report it sooner. And because when a woman reports a rape she has to answer questions about what she was wearing, and was she somewhere she shouldn't have been? Was she drinking? Was she drunk? Didn't she know better. Did she ask for it? DID SHE ASK FOR IT. REALLY??? Rape is the only crime that the victim has to prove she wasn't to blame. They would never ask a guy who's house was broken into and robbed. What he (victim) had been wearing? What he (victim) had been doing? If he (victim) was somewhere he shouldn't have been? Was he (victim) drinking? Was he (victim) drunk? Was he (victim) flirting and giving signs he was interested? This is 2017 not 1878 when pureatines ruled everyone's actions. I wish I didn't love Big bang theory. It breaks my heart but Mayims horrible attitude and responsible and justification in saying a woman asked to be raped makes me NOT want to support and watch anything and everything she is connected to as a actress and what I considered a activist for the human treatment of all of God's creatures.",2,0
WFb0EDl-JS8,"I paused this video at 1:09 to make a comment. I've seen and watched many videos from all over YouTube about how unsurprised people (women especially) are about the truth of this situation. Of course most women aren't unsurprised; I don't know any woman who hasn't been harassed in some way. What separates you from the rest of the people who have commented on this subject so far (kudos to your friend who asked the question) is that you've considered more than finger-wagging. It's a real opportunity to think critically about the future for women, and all people, to be treated differently.\\n\\nGwyneth Paltrow has said this way of¬†treating¬†women ends now,‚Äù but the utter lack of shock speaks much more loudly. The fact that no one is surprised is the problem. I am so glad that people like you are ready, willing and able to stand up, speak up and lead others--your boys included and perhaps especially--to change the way we think about things like this in the future. \\n\\nIt must be a terrifying thing to know that your child could turn into someone who would treat another person this way. The fear of that didn't make you run away, but inspired you to share your thoughts and feelings. That is what I want to thank you for. I don't agree with everything that you say or believe. If I did, your videos would be less interesting and challenging and enlightening. Nevertheless, I trust in you to do and say what you feel is right and just and best for you and the people that you love. That is why I am and will always be a fan. Thank you for thinking critically and optimistically and for trying to be a force for positive change, no matter how you see that.",1,1

MxxxlutsKuI,"To all supremacist. From an uneducated black man. Your forefathers came to this nation seeking a better life and a better way of living other than the countries that they lived. Many were under the lash of  oppression. So in God's inexplicable sovereignty he allowed you to form this great nation. You set the rules and created a government. You of course became the stewards of this nation and, as with all stewardship, you were expected to govern it with justice and fairness. The founding fathers themselves broke away from a tyrannical kingdom and by God's grace they triumphed! And America became the envy of the world. Name another nation that is greater or has a greater creed than the USA! And it was initially given to white men to govern. God was fully aware of what you were were going to do with slavery and the removal of native Americans yet he allowed this nation to become perhaps the last great nation on earth. Your generations have prospered greatly. But now you have become like the nations you fled. You have become the oppressor because you weren't faithful. You thought it was your guns and smarts that got you thus far. You are wrong! As wrong as the guys in this video. You failed to be stewards over this nation and are now being viewed as shameful in the eyes of God and all nations. Your problem is not blacks or immigrants. It is you! You broke the walls and allowed millions of illegals into this country. They work at your business's and trim your lawns. You caused Kaepernick to take a knee against your injustices. You are the reason    American customer service is now handled in India. You ran this country into the ground. But America is not done yet! It doesn't take much to turn this ship around. Just turn the wheel, keep it there, and be patient. Turn back to the original idea of this nation and stop treating the constitution like a wink wink joke. Only God is Supreeme. The rest of us are stewards who must give account!!!  I marvel at followers of Hitler. HE LOST! Died on the run like any common criminal. Why is he your model? You want your country back? Earn it by being faithful to the highest aspects of what it teaches.",8,4
MxxxlutsKuI,I believe after this disgusting spectacle in the Garden as they exited a crowd of loyal Jewish Americans attacked them and gave them a thorough ass whupping which they most definitely deserved.  This rally looked very much like the many rallies Trump had during his campaign and continues to have.  Eventually this alcoholic Kuhn was discovered to have embezzled something like fifteen thousand dollars from the coffers of this disgraceful German-American Bund and was deported to Germany where he died in ignominity from the alcoholism he was plagued by.,8,4
MxxxlutsKuI,"Trump's campaign rally tactics are straight out of the  Fascist/Nazi playbook.  His obsession with numbers, his over the top claims about his accomplishments and what he will do to ''fix'' America, his invocation of violence.  Hitler wasn't the brightest bulb in the lamp either and had a plethora of personality disorders but he got things done once he was in office which took him a decade to accomplish.

All that means is that you and your family will be last on the list.... But You're On The List!! Make no mistake about it!!! When hate runs out of people to hate that doesn't look like you then it turns on you. Russia to this day is engaged in a war with Ukraine. Ukraine is also engaged in an internal civil war while also fighting off Russia. Lots of killings.... You can watch a few of them right here on Youtube. Another one that comes to mind is Ireland in the 1970's The Troubles is what it was called. The conflict was primarily political and nationalistic, fuelled by historical events but none the less whites turning on each other because they had no ethnic people to focus their hate on... I think you get the picture..... For those of you of any race or religion, you need to take heed of the facts. Hate only germinates when you let it get out of control...... Hate finds any excuse it can to justify it's violence. So the question is... Are you smart enough to properly understand it? Weed it out? Not join in on it?....",2,2

I guarantee you there were more Nazi's in the USA pre WWII than there are now.\\n\\nTrump may attack the media that are attacking him, HOWEVER he does not call them the Jewish controlled media and in fact, he does not want to divide this country between the races, he wants us to all live in peace.\\n\\nIt is the liberal agenda to bash Trump any way they can.

So, do you expect these people who have been pillaged  to just wallow in their hallowed out countries after we've stolen their ability to fend for themselves? Would You? No! If someone stole your money you'd go to where they are hoarding the loot and try to get some of it back. So you can eat. Give your kids a better life. Etc. I am ashamed that some (not all!!) of my fellow white folks will come up with arguments to fit in with and justify their racist selves. It's pathetic bro. Progress will always bring people closer in a global economy. Instead of trying to go back to the 1600's, or the 1950's, which will NEVER happen, maybe you should think about adapting and thriving in the brave new world.

The ideas worked in practice because of the common culture, race and European heritage we once shared when our nations were nearly monolithic.\\n\\nWhite/Europeans societies tend to be high trust and meritocratic, this makes it cheap and easy to do business, but it also leaves us vulnerable to exploitation.\\n\\nIf you look around the world, corruption is the norm; most societies are tribal, oriented towards kin relations.\\n\\nWhite/Europeans societies are much more individualistic, we have become apathetic and brainwashed by the (((subversive elements))) within our gates.\\n\\nIt's abundantly clear that immigration and resettlement programs are being used as a weapon to destabilize White/Europeans Nations.\\n\\nA Nation can have safety nets, or a Nation can have open borders, but it can‚Äôt have both.\\n\\n--",0,4

MxxxlutsKuI,"To all supremacist. From an uneducated black man. Your forefathers came to this nation seeking a better life and a better way of living other than the countries that they lived. Many were under the lash of  oppression. So in God's inexplicable sovereignty he allowed you to form this great nation. You set the rules and created a government. You of course became the stewards of this nation and, as with all stewardship, you were expected to govern it with justice and fairness. The founding fathers themselves broke away from a tyrannical kingdom and by God's grace they triumphed! And America became the envy of the world. Name another nation that is greater or has a greater creed than the USA! And it was initially given to white men to govern. God was fully aware of what you were were going to do with slavery and the removal of native Americans yet he allowed this nation to become perhaps the last great nation on earth. Your generations have prospered greatly. But now you have become like the nations you fled. You have become the oppressor because you weren't faithful. You thought it was your guns and smarts that got you thus far. You are wrong! As wrong as the guys in this video. You failed to be stewards over this nation and are now being viewed as shameful in the eyes of God and all nations. Your problem is not blacks or immigrants. It is you! You broke the walls and allowed millions of illegals into this country. They work at your business's and trim your lawns. You caused Kaepernick to take a knee against your injustices. You are the reason    American customer service is now handled in India. You ran this country into the ground. But America is not done yet! It doesn't take much to turn this ship around. Just turn the wheel, keep it there, and be patient. Turn back to the original idea of this nation and stop treating the constitution like a wink wink joke. Only God is Supreeme. The rest of us are stewards who must give account!!!  I marvel at followers of Hitler. HE LOST! Died on the run like any common criminal. Why is he your model? You want your country back? Earn it by being faithful to the highest aspects of what it teaches.",9,6
MxxxlutsKuI,I believe after this disgusting spectacle in the Garden as they exited a crowd of loyal Jewish Americans attacked them and gave them a thorough ass whupping which they most definitely deserved.

Eventually this alcoholic Kuhn was discovered to have embezzled something like fifteen thousand dollars from the coffers of this disgraceful German-American Bund and was deported to Germany where he died in ignominity from the alcoholism he was plagued by.,11,6

All that means is that you and your family will be last on the list.... But You're On The List!! Make no mistake about it!!! When hate runs out of people to hate that doesn't look like you then it turns on you. Russia to this day is engaged in a war with Ukraine. Ukraine is also engaged in an internal civil war while also fighting off Russia. Lots of killings.... You can watch a few of them right here on Youtube. Another one that comes to mind is Ireland in the 1970's The Troubles is what it was called. The conflict was primarily political and nationalistic, fuelled by historical events but none the less whites turning on each other because they had no ethnic people to focus their hate on... I think you get the picture..... For those of you of any race or religion, you need to take heed of the facts. Hate only germinates when you let it get out of control...... Hate finds any excuse it can to justify it's violence. So the question is... Are you smart enough to properly understand it? Weed it out? Not join in on it?....",3,2

MxxxlutsKuI,"MARK Fleagle- what you fail to acknowledge is that there have been a number of highly successful and functional non-white societies. Here's the crux of the problem with your racist logic- white societies (in general-Not all!) That have been succesfull financially made their fortunes by looting the resources of other countries- through physical and economic colonization. Facts. So, do you expect these people who have been pillaged  to just wallow in their hallowed out countries after we've stolen their ability to fend for themselves? Would You? No! If someone stole your money you'd go to where they are hoarding the loot and try to get some of it back. So you can eat. Give your kids a better life. Etc. I am ashamed that some (not all!!) of my fellow white folks will come up with arguments to fit in with and justify their racist selves. It's pathetic bro. Progress will always bring people closer in a global economy. Instead of trying to go back to the 1600's, or the 1950's, which will NEVER happen, maybe you should think about adapting and thriving in the brave new world.

MxxxlutsKuI,"Trump's campaign rally tactics are straight out of the  Fascist/Nazi playbook.  His obsession with numbers, his over the top claims about his accomplishments and what he will do to ''fix'' America, his invocation of violence.

As, as you said, time was created to plan and organize things it's pretty handy to be able to devide time in even parts. Preferably in as many different ways as possible. 24 hours can be divided in even parts in 6 different ways. Either 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, or 12 even parts. While for example, if the day would have been divided in 20 hours it could only be divided up in even parts in 4 ways (2, 4, 5, or 10 part). 60 minutes has 10 divisors (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, or 30).

mjSwRwAqQA4,YOU DID NOT JUST STEAL FROM VSAUCE,0,0
mjSwRwAqQA4,"I don't think of 60 and 360 as totally arbitrary. They're useful numbers in that they're integer divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 (for 360 anyway), 10, 12, 15, 18 (360 again), 20, and more. That's a lot of easy divisions for people to do in their heads.",0,0
mjSwRwAqQA4,"Base 60 is a math thing. It makes figuring out fractions easier. In base 60 there is no  1/3+1/3+1/3=1, but 0.333...+0.333...+0.333... =0.999... ambeguity.  Base 12 clears that one up, but then you have a simular problem with 1/5. To clear that up, 12x5=60.  There's no proof that the Babalonians or Sumerains argued this finer point of math as we do today, other than the fact that we do so today and we have the same brains that they did.  Okay, it's not proof, it's conjecture, but it does give a possible origin as to why the ancient math of long lived civilizations chose base 12 and base 60 when they had a perfectly good set of ten fingers and ten toes and could have easily gone with base 10 or 20 like some other civilizations did.\\n\\nIn base 60, you then get the 1/7 problem. To solve that, you would have to go to base 60x7 = base 420.  But they must have thought that bit too large of a number to work with as a base, so they settled on smooth division between the numbers 1-6 and rested at 7... kind of like God did on the 7th day... mmmm...\\n\\nSo then, why make a circle 360 degrees and not 420?  That may come down to the shapes you can draw inside a circle with with a  compas. You can draw the circle (1), the straight line diameter (2), a triangle (3), a square (4), a pentagon (5), and a hexagon (6), but not a septagon (7). Its a math thing. God (or perhapse a reeely artist) knows how to draw a mathematily perfect septagon inside a circle with a compas.  However if they had chosen 420 degrees in circle instead of 360, we could have been able to have made perfect septagons by counting the tic marks, kind of like you do to make a nonagon (put a dot every 40 tics and connect).  But then how do you draw the tic marks and in the first place? With that impossible septagon thing, you can't draw a perfect 420 sided object with a compas inside a circly, but you can draw a 360 sided object.",0,0

MxxxlutsKuI,"To all supremacist. From an uneducated black man. Your forefathers came to this nation seeking a better life and a better way of living other than the countries that they lived. Many were under the lash of  oppression. So in God's inexplicable sovereignty he allowed you to form this great nation. You set the rules and created a government. You of course became the stewards of this nation and, as with all stewardship, you were expected to govern it with justice and fairness. The founding fathers themselves broke away from a tyrannical kingdom and by God's grace they triumphed! And America became the envy of the world. Name another nation that is greater or has a greater creed than the USA! And it was initially given to white men to govern. God was fully aware of what you were were going to do with slavery and the removal of native Americans yet he allowed this nation to become perhaps the last great nation on earth. Your generations have prospered greatly. But now you have become like the nations you fled. You have become the oppressor because you weren't faithful. You thought it was your guns and smarts that got you thus far. You are wrong! As wrong as the guys in this video. You failed to be stewards over this nation and are now being viewed as shameful in the eyes of God and all nations. Your problem is not blacks or immigrants. It is you! You broke the walls and allowed millions of illegals into this country. They work at your business's and trim your lawns. You caused Kaepernick to take a knee against your injustices. You are the reason    American customer service is now handled in India. You ran this country into the ground. But America is not done yet! It doesn't take much to turn this ship around. Just turn the wheel, keep it there, and be patient. Turn back to the original idea of this nation and stop treating the constitution like a wink wink joke. Only God is Supreeme. The rest of us are stewards who must give account!!!  I marvel at followers of Hitler. HE LOST! Died on the run like any common criminal. Why is he your model? You want your country back? Earn it by being faithful to the highest aspects of what it teaches.",10,11

MxxxlutsKuI,I believe after this disgusting spectacle in the Garden as they exited a crowd of loyal Jewish Americans attacked them and gave them a thorough ass whupping which they most definitely deserved.  This rally looked very much like the many rallies Trump had during his campaign and continues to have.  Eventually this alcoholic Kuhn was discovered to have embezzled something like fifteen thousand dollars from the coffers of this disgraceful German-American Bund and was deported to Germany where he died in ignominity from the alcoholism he was plagued by.,16,9

MxxxlutsKuI,"MARK Fleagle- what you fail to acknowledge is that there have been a number of highly successful and functional non-white societies. Here's the crux of the problem with your racist logic- white societies (in general-Not all!) That have been succesfull financially made their fortunes by looting the resources of other countries- through physical and economic colonization. Facts. So, do you expect these people who have been pillaged  to just wallow in their hallowed out countries after we've stolen their ability to fend for themselves? Would You? No! If someone stole your money you'd go to where they are hoarding the loot and try to get some of it back. So you can eat. Give your kids a better life. Etc. I am ashamed that some (not all!!) of my fellow white folks will come up with arguments to fit in with and justify their racist selves. It's pathetic bro. Progress will always bring people closer in a global economy. Instead of trying to go back to the 1600's, or the 1950's, which will NEVER happen, maybe you should think about adapting and thriving in the brave new world. Or you can continue to bang your head against a brick wall and have mad lines on your face from fomenting hatred and being angry all the damn time. You, just like this Nazi version of Nationalist, are on the wrong side of history. No one can stop progress. Stupid.",3,5

MxxxlutsKuI,"Hate doesn't just go away after they get their way. It just transforms. To those that think your safe because you are white.... All that means is that you and your family will be last on the list.... But You're On The List!! Make no mistake about it!!! When hate runs out of people to hate that doesn't look like you then it turns on you. Russia to this day is engaged in a war with Ukraine. Ukraine is also engaged in an internal civil war while also fighting off Russia. Lots of killings.... You can watch a few of them right here on Youtube. Another one that comes to mind is Ireland in the 1970's The Troubles is what it was called. The conflict was primarily political and nationalistic, fuelled by historical events but none the less whites turning on each other because they had no ethnic people to focus their hate on... I think you get the picture..... For those of you of any race or religion, you need to take heed of the facts. Hate only germinates when you let it get out of control...... Hate finds any excuse it can to justify it's violence. So the question is... Are you smart enough to properly understand it? Weed it out? Not join in on it?....",4,2

MxxxlutsKuI,"Trump's campaign rally tactics are straight out of the  Fascist/Nazi playbook.  His obsession with numbers, his over the top claims about his accomplishments and what he will do to ''fix'' America, his invocation of violence.  Hitler wasn't the brightest bulb in the lamp either and had a plethora of personality disorders but he got things done once he was in office which took him a decade to accomplish.

I guarantee you there were more Nazi's in the USA pre WWII than there are now.\\n\\nTrump may attack the media that are attacking him, HOWEVER he does not call them the Jewish controlled media and in fact, he does not want to divide this country between the races, he wants us to all live in peace.\\n\\nIt is the liberal agenda to bash Trump any way they can.

MxxxlutsKuI,Propaganda this is out now because of the NFL protest against America and Trump. \nKey point to notice.\nThe soundtrack does NOT show the woman singing our American anthem.

MxxxlutsKuI,"Whites/Europeans have been forced to live under the yoke of a despotic government that imposes a soft autocratic control called Socialism.\\n\\nQuestion: So what is Socialism???\\n\\nAnswer: Socialism is the transition of a society to communism characterized by the imperfect implementation of collectivist principles. In short Socialism is divisive ideology sold as freedom which is intended to enslave, kill, and destroy Nationalism.\\n\\nQuestion: So what is Nationalism???\\n\\nAnswer: Nationalism is the policy or doctrine of asserting the interests of one's own nation viewed as separate from the interests of other nations or the common interests of all nations.\\n\\nQuestion: So what is a Nation???\\n\\nAnswer: A Nation an aggregation of persons of the same race and ethnic family, often speaking the same language or cognate languages. \\n\\nQuestion: So what is Communism???  \\n\\nAnswer: Communism is an organization in which all economic and social activity is controlled by a totalitarian state dominated by a single and self-perpetuating political party.\\n\\nQuestion: Why do people the world over, clamor to enter the gates of the White/Europeans Nations???\\n\\nAnswer: White/Europeans are far more culturally and socially conscious than our counterparts. European civilization remain intact because we exist; not despite our existence.  \\n\\nEuropeans comprise an estimated 7 to 8% of the world population making us a tiny minority.\\n\\nOnly 2 to 3% of White/European Women are of child bearing age.\\n\\nWhite/Europeans understand the role of race in creating our civilization, but we also must incorporate that same understanding in the defense of our own Nations.\\n\\nWhite/Europeans created the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights based on an amalgamation of principles, standards and ideologies that were distinctly European in origin; this body of ideas had never been applied or practiced by any other Nation. The ideas worked in practice because of the common culture, race and European heritage we once shared when our nations were nearly monolithic.\\n\\nWhite/Europeans societies tend to be high trust and meritocratic, this makes it cheap and easy to do business, but it also leaves us vulnerable to exploitation.\\n\\nIf you look around the world, corruption is the norm; most societies are tribal, oriented towards kin relations.\\n\\nWhite/Europeans societies are much more individualistic, we have become apathetic and brainwashed by the (((subversive elements))) within our gates.\\n\\nIt's abundantly clear that immigration and resettlement programs are being used as a weapon to destabilize White/Europeans Nations.\\n\\nA Nation can have safety nets, or a Nation can have open borders, but it can‚Äôt have both.\\n\\n--",2,5

Talks about drafting the poor folk then only when they started drafting the middle class and higher did people really start complaining, paying to dodge the draft, etc.\\n\\nWe already now know 9/11 was done or came mostly from Saudi Arabia and the government has done nothing nor will they ever cause they're an ally of the US and threatened to sell off hundreds of billions of dollars‚Äô worth of American assets held by the kingdom if they tried to try them.

Those ancient number systems put together by ancient mathematicians were well thought out, and in many ways more elegant than the base 10 system that has become standard today.",0,0

mjSwRwAqQA4,"Using numbers like 12, 24, 60 and 360 isn't arbitrary. At least not from a mathematical point of view. Mathematicians prefer those numbers because they have many factors (divisors). As you said they already used used those when dividing circles and because they measured time in (semi) circles, it's logical they used the same numbers.\\nEven without the need of circles to measure time these numbers still are practical. As, as you said, time was created to plan and organize things it's pretty handy to be able to devide time in even parts. Preferably in as many different ways as possible. 24 hours can be divided in even parts in 6 different ways. Either 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, or 12 even parts. While for example, if the day would have been divided in 20 hours it could only be divided up in even parts in 4 ways (2, 4, 5, or 10 part). 60 minutes has 10 divisors (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, or 30). If they had chosen 100 (as some decimal/metric extremists around the French revolution wanted)  it would have only had 7 (2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, or 50).",0,0

mjSwRwAqQA4,YOU DID NOT JUST STEAL FROM VSAUCE,0,0
mjSwRwAqQA4,"I don't think of 60 and 360 as totally arbitrary. They're useful numbers in that they're integer divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 (for 360 anyway), 10, 12, 15, 18 (360 again), 20, and more. That's a lot of easy divisions for people to do in their heads.",0,0
mjSwRwAqQA4,"Base 60 is a math thing. It makes figuring out fractions easier. In base 60 there is no  1/3+1/3+1/3=1, but 0.333...+0.333...+0.333... =0.999... ambeguity.  Base 12 clears that one up, but then you have a simular problem with 1/5. To clear that up, 12x5=60.  There's no proof that the Babalonians or Sumerains argued this finer point of math as we do today, other than the fact that we do so today and we have the same brains that they did.  Okay, it's not proof, it's conjecture, but it does give a possible origin as to why the ancient math of long lived civilizations chose base 12 and base 60 when they had a perfectly good set of ten fingers and ten toes and could have easily gone with base 10 or 20 like some other civilizations did.\\n\\nIn base 60, you then get the 1/7 problem. To solve that, you would have to go to base 60x7 = base 420.  But they must have thought that bit too large of a number to work with as a base, so they settled on smooth division between the numbers 1-6 and rested at 7... kind of like God did on the 7th day... mmmm...\\n\\nSo then, why make a circle 360 degrees and not 420?  That may come down to the shapes you can draw inside a circle with with a  compas. You can draw the circle (1), the straight line diameter (2), a triangle (3), a square (4), a pentagon (5), and a hexagon (6), but not a septagon (7). Its a math thing. God (or perhapse a reeely artist) knows how to draw a mathematily perfect septagon inside a circle with a compas.  However if they had chosen 420 degrees in circle instead of 360, we could have been able to have made perfect septagons by counting the tic marks, kind of like you do to make a nonagon (put a dot every 40 tics and connect).  But then how do you draw the tic marks and in the first place? With that impossible septagon thing, you can't draw a perfect 420 sided object with a compas inside a circly, but you can draw a 360 sided object.",0,0

mjSwRwAqQA4,"Using numbers like 12, 24, 60 and 360 isn't arbitrary. At least not from a mathematical point of view. Mathematicians prefer those numbers because they have many factors (divisors). As you said they already used used those when dividing circles and because they measured time in (semi) circles, it's logical they used the same numbers.\\nEven without the need of circles to measure time these numbers still are practical. As, as you said, time was created to plan and organize things it's pretty handy to be able to devide time in even parts. Preferably in as many different ways as possible. 24 hours can be divided in even parts in 6 different ways. Either 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, or 12 even parts. While for example, if the day would have been divided in 20 hours it could only be divided up in even parts in 4 ways (2, 4, 5, or 10 part). 60 minutes has 10 divisors (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, or 30).

I wish Americans knew how to direct war movies because it seems they're more concerned with family stories and shit....which is why Black Hawk Down was directed by a British man (Ridley Scott - Prometheus, Alien Covenant) Scott's movies are visually stunning and BHD was the best visual war movie ever made. \\n\\nP.S please Americans, forget your bullshit heroics and your family characters, we want the first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan stretched over 2 hours with nothing inbetween",0,0

-Denciie5oA,"9/11 wasn't a crime committed by Muslims!! There was a stand down of US military fighter jets, when they knew the several planes had been hijacked! 10 of the hijackers are still alive and were freed back to their home country after several months of being held in the US. Several even appeared on TV shows in their own country and did interviews. Building 7 of the World Trade Centers had preplanted explosives all throughout the building before the attacks, placed by CIA agents, one of which openly admitted on his death bed to¬† him and 3 others being ordered to place them as he was an engineer. The owner of the World Trade Centers 1 & 2 Larry Silverstien, then apparently ordered the firefighters to pull the building while it had been burning constantly for hours, which he himself unequivocally says he said to pull it¬†in a famous¬†interview which he later regretted. Demolition¬† charges would take weeks to be placed all throughout the building, and firefighters DO NOT even do that. That is not at all a part of their protocol or job training. Larry Silverstein took out an insurance policy protecting the buildings against terrorist attacks 2 months before the 9/11 attacks and profited over $7 billion from their destruction from the insurance policy. There were power downs of the World Trade Centers¬†a week before the attacks in which engineers were walking in and out of the building unobserved by security. Security of the building which was headed by G Bush's cousin. Explosives are how the World Trade Centers 1¬†& 2 were collapsed.¬†Fires alone do not burn hot enough to collapse¬†industrial steel beams and there is¬†extensive evidence to prove this.¬†Phone calls cannot be made from airplanes above 7,000 feet max and the planes travel too fast for the signal to smoothly be transferred from phone tower to phone tower and the phone calls are dropped, yet the records show phone continuous phone calls over 18 minutes on the hijacked planes and phony flight attendant calling back more than once. No plane hit the pentagon, it was planted explosives. There was no airplane debris¬†characteristic to an airplane crash, the width of the building where the wings would have¬†impacted still had fully intact windows. The hijacked planes were taken control over by a remote¬†flight control¬†system¬†sold to the airlines in the 80's and had been around since the 70's where the military can take control over the airplanes controls and fly it like a drone in case of an emergency and the pilot isn't able. The hijacked planes were taken control of by this system, and landed at WESTOVER airforce base in Western MA and hidden in hangers used¬†for storing large¬†C-5 transport planes, where the passengers were then gassed to death in the planes on the ground. One plane¬†was not able to be taken over and controlled and landed at an airport in Cleveland Ohio due to the stand down of all airlines ordered by the airports.¬†The hijacked planes were replaced in air with something different without it showing up on the radars which is a specific military operation protocol to replace a plane with another and have it unknown. The air force base where the hijacked planes landed was completely locked out to military personnel for 3 days!¬†due to a military/government drill taking place the day of 9/11 training for an all out war scenario. Keep in mind this drill was planned and scheduled before 9/11 when the attacks took place. THERE IS UNDENIABLE EXTENSIVE EVIDENCE OF ALL OF THIS! This was not done by the America Government we know and love but by corrupt entities in positions of too much¬†power scattered throughout the US government and world with their own agenda actually something they were kinda born into. The Zionist Rothschild Mossad is the collection of knowledge and mindset responsible for this extensive operation to take place. They forced Bush to then commit war against Muslims after the attack¬†as the scapegoats. Zionist Jews did 911 and blamed it on the Arabs, Iraq are enemies of Isreal and the US fought them for them. This whole war has been a manufactured plot to serve¬†an elite few of others interests. And of course the story we have all known for over 15 years is manufactured! I know it is almost completely unbelievable at first but, there is COUNTLESS clear facts and evidence that the story America was told was not the truth. The Vietnam war was manufactured based on a lie of events in a similar way to serve an elite fews interests. God bless you.",0,0

mjSwRwAqQA4,Great good vid. time is a tool used to measure things of every sort. It's also actually like a type of ruler. And it is also one other thing. It is tangible and it is real. It is actually possible for one two observe time actually stop. When one is in that state of being time actually does stop. I have experienced it more than once it's not a very good feeling so I don't do it anymore. But it made me aware of the fact that one can enter into that place of timelessness which is also called eternity. When there is no more time then you experience eternity.,0,0

Those ancient number systems put together by ancient mathematicians were well thought out, and in many ways more elegant than the base 10 system that has become standard today.",0,0

mjSwRwAqQA4,"Using numbers like 12, 24, 60 and 360 isn't arbitrary. At least not from a mathematical point of view. Mathematicians prefer those numbers because they have many factors (divisors). As you said they already used used those when dividing circles and because they measured time in (semi) circles, it's logical they used the same numbers.\\nEven without the need of circles to measure time these numbers still are practical. As, as you said, time was created to plan and organize things it's pretty handy to be able to devide time in even parts. Preferably in as many different ways as possible. 24 hours can be divided in even parts in 6 different ways. Either 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, or 12 even parts. While for example, if the day would have been divided in 20 hours it could only be divided up in even parts in 4 ways (2, 4, 5, or 10 part). 60 minutes has 10 divisors (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, or 30). If they had chosen 100 (as some decimal/metric extremists around the French revolution wanted)  it would have only had 7 (2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, or 50).",0,0
