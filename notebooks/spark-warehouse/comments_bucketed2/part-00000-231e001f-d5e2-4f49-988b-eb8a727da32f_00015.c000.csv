ql0Op1VcELw,"I know train isn't really popular in the US, but I highly doubt that electric planes will be in concurrence with trains in Europe. Distances here are really shorter and the major advantage of train stations is that as they were pretty much all built in the late 1800's/early 1900's at the periphery of cities, they are now the heart of the cities. You get down the train and you are immediately where you need to be (most of the times with a lot of easy public transportations). Take Paris for example : its 4 majors train stations are all in the middle of the city while you need at least 30 more minutes to get back from airports to the centre (not even counting the checks and everything). That being said, even if we laugh a lot about it, train transportation is very developped and popular here in France, with high-quality high speed railways and a great local network and there might be a hole to fill in other countries, especially in the US with congested traffic",0,0

If airlines are still flying 747s across the pond which is 20yrs older, that means 757/767 still have at least 25yrs left in them. How about Boeing just create a NEO project for the 757? Quieter and even more fuel efficient, especially with those really loud Rolls Royce versions, but then again I love engine noise, I miss that at the airport. The NOISE, the smoke trails from DC9s, 727s and 737-200s. Eventually airlines and all transportation industries are gonna have to search for alternative energy sources, its inevitable.

It is true that we might have decades of fossile fuels left over, but we can‚Äôt ever burn that all if we would want to keep this planet an inhabitable home for many further generations.\\n\\nThe plane of the future in my subjective opinion is a zero-emission, perhaps solar-powered or at least ‚Äúgreen‚Äù energy loaded aircraft with about the capacity of a rather small long-haul airliner and the range of this new Boeing 797 concept.\\nBy 2030 already, we will have about 1,000,000,000 more people living on earth than now and this leads me to being concerned more about the regular medium to short-haul travel than a couple transatlantic flights.\\nThere will be a point when our usual short to medium-haul airliners like the 737 will not be capable of running the routes they fly anymore because of capacity issues. More and more people are living on earth and the percentage of people using air traffic as their mean of transport is increasing just as quick.\\nAirlines like Swiss, Austrian and British already use 777s and 767s for routes like Vienna - Frankfurt, Zurich - Vienna and London - Amsterdam. And that is only one of countless flights on these routes each day. If zero-emission aircraft don‚Äôt become a reality, running larger capacity, fuel efficient planes a couple less times a day rather than more low-capacity aircraft will over a long course perhaps be the better solution for our planet, air congestion, those affected by aircraft noise and so on and so forth. It may make us dispense with comfort in terms of frequency of flights and travel times, but I don‚Äôt think I have to elaborate that our earth is more valuable than arriving somewhere one hour earlier or later.",2,0

ykvX-E1nuag,"It's interesting that you brought that up Hank, because that's pretty much exactly what's been in my head upon meeting you on Sunday.  I'm not sure that you remember me, but I was the Asian girl in the red beanie, the blue hair, I had a face full of makeup, puffy jumper and healed boots. Now already, I can feel the judgement/ analysis of the type of person you (the reader) think that I am... And that's okay, because it's human nature. It protects you from imminent danger and whatnot. The way I presented myself that day is not exactly what you would call the 'typical nerdfighter' image. It makes me wonder how different your perception of me would have been if I had my glasses on, I'd worn a hoody, and I'd come up to you barefaced (and here I am stereotyping the typical geek or nerd -.- see we all do it). Don't get me wrong Hank, you were lovely, but when you looked at me for the first time it was a look of suprise almost. Idk maybe that's just how I read it. It suddenly kicked in that you had no idea who I was, yet I knew so much about you (your personality, your likes and dislikes, your hobbies, your intellect, your status etc etc) and I can only imagine how hard it would be to be meeting all these strangers, hundreds in a row, and being nice to them and trying to make them feel welcome. I realised that your perception of me would be purely based upon this 60 second time frame. (In which those 60 seconds I freaked out, ran up and hugged you, acted like a complete fangirl and said exactly the things I had decided not to say to u when waiting in the line haha). But I feel as if we have this programming inside our minds that automatically works to act a certain way towards people depending on the type of person we perceive them to be or by how safe we feel in their presence. Its not a bad thing. It's just human nature and it protects us. But man, on the other hand, this is exactly the reason why some people are so self conscious and so insecure about what they look like (I know I definitely struggle with that on the regular.. Because I WANT to dress how I want, i want to be able to have fun with what I wear and make up my face so that if u made a collage of my face each day, it would be like a fluid mosaic) We can't stop the judgement, because it is innate, but we can go into meeting a new person with an open mind. I just think its an interesting topic...but I mean, socialising is harddd. Probability of u reading this: probably zero. But worth a shot anyway :)",0,0

ql0Op1VcELw,"Wouldn't electric trains just undercut airplanes for short range in price? I guess to understand that you'd have to understand how trains are profitable. I think that you can't sell the idea that short haul flight saves time over trains when you have to spend more time at the airport just to get on the plane with security checkpoints, boarding 45 minutes before flight, and maybe not so much taxing but it's still a factor. Trains don't have to deal with these things to get from point A to point B. Especially in your example of NY to DC (and that's about the only short haul route in the US where that works because Amtrak at least owns the Northeast Corridor track). In other areas where Amtrak pays for the usage of track on a freight line a short haul flight may be faster.",0,0

ql0Op1VcELw,The fucking aircraft can reach max speed if it were to except they choose not to because it's more fuel efficient.,2,0
ql0Op1VcELw,"Electric ...facepalm. There is a reason people don't use electric aircraft. Very, very poor energy per kg means the payload would be increased to the point of insanity. The entire point is to reduce the costs of fuel, electricity still costs money and still produces CO2, usually more cost and CO2 than an efficient combustion or jet engine for that matter. Then the idea of flying with the majority of the aircraft full of huge lithium batteries is, uh, a little dangerous. Currently we already get a reasonable number of lithium battery issues - a small battery setting on fire and burning up. If the aircraft is not only full of massive numbers of lithium batteries but the batteries are forced to be as efficient as possible rather than a big heavy and safe/reliable battery (often lead acid rather than lithium) then we can expect a dramatically increased rate of accidents. Then the biggest danger in aircraft crashes currently is the fuel leaks and fires. With lithium batteries' near certainty to set alight, incredibly high temperature, very rapid reaction, and huge difficulty in putting the fire out we would certainly see a large increase in deaths. And finally electric engines are incredibly poor and inefficient in transonic flight. A slower flight means not only fewer passengers but more aircraft needed to shift the same amount of passengers and thus higher fuel and maintenance costs. In short the concept of electric aircraft to replace anything from the small under-100 seat regional aircraft to the large A380 super jumbos is simply a pipe dream. Electric cars are less efficient than hybrid cars for fuel and CO2 costs, an aircraft with its significant disadvantages beyond increased fuel efficiency... just no.",1,3

ykvX-E1nuag,"It's interesting that you brought that up Hank, because that's pretty much exactly what's been in my head upon meeting you on Sunday.  I'm not sure that you remember me, but I was the Asian girl in the red beanie, the blue hair, I had a face full of makeup, puffy jumper and healed boots. Now already, I can feel the judgement/ analysis of the type of person you (the reader) think that I am... And that's okay, because it's human nature. It protects you from imminent danger and whatnot. The way I presented myself that day is not exactly what you would call the 'typical nerdfighter' image. It makes me wonder how different your perception of me would have been if I had my glasses on, I'd worn a hoody, and I'd come up to you barefaced (and here I am stereotyping the typical geek or nerd -.- see we all do it). Don't get me wrong Hank, you were lovely, but when you looked at me for the first time it was a look of suprise almost. Idk maybe that's just how I read it. It suddenly kicked in that you had no idea who I was, yet I knew so much about you (your personality, your likes and dislikes, your hobbies, your intellect, your status etc etc) and I can only imagine how hard it would be to be meeting all these strangers, hundreds in a row, and being nice to them and trying to make them feel welcome. I realised that your perception of me would be purely based upon this 60 second time frame. (In which those 60 seconds I freaked out, ran up and hugged you, acted like a complete fangirl and said exactly the things I had decided not to say to u when waiting in the line haha). But I feel as if we have this programming inside our minds that automatically works to act a certain way towards people depending on the type of person we perceive them to be or by how safe we feel in their presence. Its not a bad thing. It's just human nature and it protects us. But man, on the other hand, this is exactly the reason why some people are so self conscious and so insecure about what they look like (I know I definitely struggle with that on the regular.. Because I WANT to dress how I want, i want to be able to have fun with what I wear and make up my face so that if u made a collage of my face each day, it would be like a fluid mosaic) We can't stop the judgement, because it is innate, but we can go into meeting a new person with an open mind. I just think its an interesting topic...but I mean, socialising is harddd. Probability of u reading this: probably zero. But worth a shot anyway :)",0,0

I mean, the videos are also much, MUCH more positive and optimistic overall and about the future as we go along but there's also a lot more discussion on mortality and growing older, as well as actual death (both good news, like how less people are dying now which is great and also the many horrible ways in which living things are dying...and Lemon).\\n\\nI think the channel is still great and perhaps more importantly, still greatly loved.

ql0Op1VcELw,"I hope they use electric planes as soon as possible. Using alle the oil until its get expensive as hell, they can go away from oil and let it people who don't have the money to change (heating with oil as example). Sure the big step is to produce a battery that is lighter than a li-ion. There is a video on YouTube that explain the physics of a battery and which elements future batteries can use to get lighter and can use for batteries. As example: helium and hydrogen are both the lights elements (even air is heavier) but you can't use it for batteries.\\n\\nWhen they start early, this is a right sing. I don't know if it worth putting solar panels on a plane but when, it is worth a try for longer routes. When the government fund these type of planes and makes flying on this planes cheaper. When people don't care if they need 2 hours (or even longer) longer across the Atlantic but they can save money, they will use it. They can use these planes until better batteries are on the market. When the hyperloop comes, planes can lose a lot of passangers. Sure transatlantic routes will take a lot of time until it's build and consumes a lot of money and probably will never come.",0,0
ql0Op1VcELw,"Batteries have nowhere near the energy density of jet fuel (nearly 60 times less) and weight is the limiting factor in aircraft performance and efficiency.  Add in the fact that conventional aircraft get more efficient as fuel is burned off while electric aircraft have to lug around dead weight in the form of expended batteries, and I don't see how electric aircraft can ever compete, even on short flights.  Maybe we'll see the electric aircraft of the future dropping AA's via parachute as it uses them up, then at least it might have a chance.",0,0
ql0Op1VcELw,"Hi Wendover, one thing you didn't address in this video is the additional strain that large numbers of regional electric plane routes would put on existing airports. For example, Heathrow runs at almost full capacity right now, so if the trains from Edinburgh were replaced by electric planes, where would they land? And what effect would this have on price, efficiency, etc? Thanks",0,0

ql0Op1VcELw,"today the biggest time and comfort consumer isn't the plane, it's getting to and from the plane. i'd like to hear your analysis and suggestions for what to do about airports. the airport is not even sort of close to where we live nor the place we want to get to which means long drives or train hops. we also spend more time waiting than actually flying. waiting for bag scanning, waiting for check in, waiting to get through security, waiting at customs, waiting in the lounge while other board, waiting in the queue to take off, then again at the other end.\\nwhy aren't there more airports and better designed? multiple security checkpoints spread throughout rather than just one you have to walk to, wait at, then walk again all the way to your gate. why is there only one boarding bridge? planes have plenty of doors, why don't we board from at least 4 doors at once? and so on. some of it is costs, but then just sitting at the airport is also very expensive, and airport size could be reduced by half if passenger throughput was increased by reducing waiting time by half - if people need to spend 2 hours at an airport rather than 1 hour, there will be twice as many people and planes at the airport.",0,0

ql0Op1VcELw,"Electric aircraft won't dominate short-haul markets if high-speed rail or the Hyperloop ever find their footing.  Airport-security makes flying MUCH less convenient, stressful and slower for most people, and the only reason airlines can compete on cost with trains is because airlines are HEAVILY subsidized by the government (government pays for airport security, for national aviation agencies, for many safety inspections, for flight marshals, and numerous other costs.  If governments wizen up and invest in Hyperloops instead, they will save ENORMOUS amounts of money vs. subsidizing airlines...)  Also, trains are more energy-efficient than even electric aircraft (which is good for the environment) and can easily go electric by adding a third rail to their tracks.  The driving factor of trains' costs is labor- which means trains not only generate a lot more jobs (good for the economy and politicians), but their costs could easily go down with automation or the elimination of the Minimum Wage (which could be compensated for with wage-subsidies or a Universal Basic Income...)",1,0

Ghastly.. homeless outcasts.. of unwanted lay waste  society.... GHOULS! and they take a woman every year and feast on their freshly born children to chill the hunger.. after the feast they prepare for the next ceremony. \\n\\nbut like that rose analogy.. that's not what the message is about. it's about: in our perspective of society.. we view each other as... clean... hardworking.. non-savage but in other cultures which they are okay with.. eating the  children of kids is the norm and we should learn to accept the way they act.

I really loved it especially bars, because I am naturally strong and they were fun for me. I am now 17 and haven't done gymnastics for six years. Do you think it is possible for me to get back into it? Or do you think it's too late?",0,0
LolP3Y7_Irs,"You guys are so lucky, I have always loved gymnastics but for the past couple of years I haven't been able to do any because the nearest gym with a men's team is several hours away, and the closest gym is an all girls one that I could walk to if I wanted. The pain is real",0,0

ql0Op1VcELw,"I hope they use electric planes as soon as possible. Using alle the oil until its get expensive as hell, they can go away from oil and let it people who don't have the money to change (heating with oil as example). Sure the big step is to produce a battery that is lighter than a li-ion. There is a video on YouTube that explain the physics of a battery and which elements future batteries can use to get lighter and can use for batteries. As example: helium and hydrogen are both the lights elements (even air is heavier) but you can't use it for batteries.\\n\\nWhen they start early, this is a right sing. I don't know if it worth putting solar panels on a plane but when, it is worth a try for longer routes. When the government fund these type of planes and makes flying on this planes cheaper. When people don't care if they need 2 hours (or even longer) longer across the Atlantic but they can save money, they will use it. They can use these planes until better batteries are on the market. When the hyperloop comes, planes can lose a lot of passangers. Sure transatlantic routes will take a lot of time until it's build and consumes a lot of money and probably will never come.",0,0

Add in the fact that conventional aircraft get more efficient as fuel is burned off while electric aircraft have to lug around dead weight in the form of expended batteries, and I don't see how electric aircraft can ever compete, even on short flights.  Maybe we'll see the electric aircraft of the future dropping AA's via parachute as it uses them up, then at least it might have a chance.",0,0

ql0Op1VcELw,"today the biggest time and comfort consumer isn't the plane, it's getting to and from the plane. i'd like to hear your analysis and suggestions for what to do about airports. the airport is not even sort of close to where we live nor the place we want to get to which means long drives or train hops. we also spend more time waiting than actually flying. waiting for bag scanning, waiting for check in, waiting to get through security, waiting at customs, waiting in the lounge while other board, waiting in the queue to take off, then again at the other end.\\nwhy aren't there more airports and better designed? multiple security checkpoints spread throughout rather than just one you have to walk to, wait at, then walk again all the way to your gate. why is there only one boarding bridge? planes have plenty of doors, why don't we board from at least 4 doors at once? and so on. some of it is costs, but then just sitting at the airport is also very expensive, and airport size could be reduced by half if passenger throughput was increased by reducing waiting time by half - if people need to spend 2 hours at an airport rather than 1 hour, there will be twice as many people and planes at the airport.",0,0

ql0Op1VcELw,"Electric aircraft won't dominate short-haul markets if high-speed rail or the Hyperloop ever find their footing.  Airport-security makes flying MUCH less convenient, stressful and slower for most people, and the only reason airlines can compete on cost with trains is because airlines are HEAVILY subsidized by the government (government pays for airport security, for national aviation agencies, for many safety inspections, for flight marshals, and numerous other costs.  If governments wizen up and invest in Hyperloops instead, they will save ENORMOUS amounts of money vs. subsidizing airlines...)  Also, trains are more energy-efficient than even electric aircraft (which is good for the environment) and can easily go electric by adding a third rail to their tracks.  The driving factor of trains' costs is labor- which means trains not only generate a lot more jobs (good for the economy and politicians), but their costs could easily go down with automation or the elimination of the Minimum Wage (which could be compensated for with wage-subsidies or a Universal Basic Income...)",1,0

The moment when he said Darren Aronofsky in that cheesy way sums up exactly what he got from the film. Nothing.

This movies problem is its metaphors are like massive boxer fists punching you in the nose. think about the shining for example it had a surface level story allowing you to dig into the deeper meanings. this movie has no surface level story so it therefore cant be deep even if its meaning would otherwise be deep if told through a regular surface level story. spoilers the movie is the book of genesis from the bible.",2,0

a41k9oJN0FI,I said as we walked out of the theater that was allegorical and there  were several examples of foreshadowing the Michelle pfeiffer character's son death foreshadows the death of the baby.

LolP3Y7_Irs,hey nile do you think it's too late to start gymnastics at the age of nearly 15??\n\nEDIT: DAYUM 28 ON TRENDING LETS GO,2,2
LolP3Y7_Irs,I really want to do gymnastics but I have never done it before. I'm nearly 18 and feel like I won't be good enough to start gymnastics now. I'm not in the best of shape either. I know they do adult gymnastics by me at lillenshall but I feel like I won't be good enough or fit enough. Do yo have any advice or should I think Of something else to do.,1,2
LolP3Y7_Irs,That redhaired gymnast is FINE!\nI hope he didn't hurt his foot...,1,1
LolP3Y7_Irs,R u going to the next commonwealth games If so I might see u there cause I'm going there great vid!!!,1,1
LolP3Y7_Irs,"Nile , is there any way you could make a video giving advice to gymnasts like me who are finding it hard to resist quitting gymnastics and can't find much of a reason to stay in the sport :// I love the sport and couldn't imagine my life without it but I don't know wether to quit",1,3
LolP3Y7_Irs,How tall are you? Nile,1,1
LolP3Y7_Irs,why not do the safer things with the blindfold. like handstand. swinging on the bar/rings with the foam blocks under it. or a blindfolded handstand walk race. with things on the side so you know you are going the right way.,2,1

LolP3Y7_Irs,Have you ever tried the carmona on rings?,1,1
LolP3Y7_Irs,"Hi Nile, I did gymnastics when I was younger but i was never flexible enough to advance to a higher level. It got to the point where my coach told my parents that they would have better luck spending their money elsewhere. I really loved it especially bars, because I am naturally strong and they were fun for me. I am now 17 and haven't done gymnastics for six years. Do you think it is possible for me to get back into it? Or do you think it's too late?",1,1
LolP3Y7_Irs,"Hey do you twist both ways in training or competitions? Im really only able to twist one way, kind of frustrating id like to see your take on it",1,1

ql0Op1VcELw,"The plausibility of electric transports has to be considered in question until it is proven not. The most plausible version of the idea, I suppose, is a fuel cell, but a fuel cell does not eliminate the need to carry the fuel necessary to support powered flight. I am not sure about the idea of short haul airplanes replacing the train. The airport has to be gotten to and there has to be screening and boarding. All of this means the process of flying inevitably has to be extremely time consuming even if the time in the air is brief. Boarding an intercity train, even for a trip of some hours, need not be more complicated than boarding a bus or a commuter train. The problem with the train, at least in the United States, is that issue of providing short and medium haul train service is tied to plethora of hobbyhorse issues, notably the idea of downtown-to-downtown service. The problem is, downtowns have their drawbacks. They are often are congested and hard to get into and out of and that they may no longer have the infrastructure necessary to provide for the needs of travelers, especially accommodations and car rental.\\n\\nThe state of California, where I live, right now is spending tens of billions of dollars building a high speed rail line through rural Central California which most likely will end of being a train to nowhere for many decades to come. In reality, the state could set up commuter-grade service between Los Angeles and the Bay Area with stops in San Jose, Salinas, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Ventura and Burbank within literal weeks if the will was there. Notably, all accommodations would be available on both ends of the run due to proximity to already operating airports. No, I don't think short haul airplanes are a real competitor to trains, provided the trains are sited properly. At or near airports or in suburban locations would be better options for the end terminals that this downtown-to-downtown idiocy. In between, the existing terminals of the smaller cities would be adequate. VTOL (vertical takeoff and landing) could change this picture somewhat, but it could be pricey and an option only for the high end traveler.",0,0

ql0Op1VcELw,"Electric aircraft won't dominate short-haul markets if high-speed rail or the Hyperloop ever find their footing.  Airport-security makes flying MUCH less convenient, stressful and slower for most people, and the only reason airlines can compete on cost with trains is because airlines are HEAVILY subsidized by the government (government pays for airport security, for national aviation agencies, for many safety inspections, for flight marshals, and numerous other costs.  If governments wizen up and invest in Hyperloops instead, they will save ENORMOUS amounts of money vs. subsidizing airlines...)  Also, trains are more energy-efficient than even electric aircraft (which is good for the environment) and can easily go electric by adding a third rail to their tracks.  The driving factor of trains' costs is labor- which means trains not only generate a lot more jobs (good for the economy and politicians), but their costs could easily go down with automation or the elimination of the Minimum Wage (which could be compensated for with wage-subsidies or a Universal Basic Income...)",1,0

Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\\n\\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\\n\\nJesus said unto them,\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\\n\\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\\n\\nbut Jesus hid himself, \\nand went out of the temple,\\ngoing through the midst of them, \\nand so passed by.\\n\\n(John 8:58-59).\\n\\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\\n\\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\\n\\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\\n\\nThen answered Jesus \\nand said unto them,\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \\n\\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\\nfor what things soever he doeth, \\nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\\n\\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\\n\\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \\nand sheweth him all things \\nthat himself doeth:\\nand he will shew him \\ngreater works than these, \\nthat ye may marvel.\\n\\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\\n\\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \\nand quickeneth them; \\neven so the Son quickeneth \\nwhom he will.\\n\\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\\n\\n(John 5:19-21).",0,0

The one heads up was hearing Lawrence say The house represents earth.\\n\\nAfterwards, both of us left the theater thinking it was a swing and a miss. Almost every shot of Lawrence was a tight shot that totally filled the screen with her face. The two most relevant segments of the movie seemed like never ending nightmares you couldn't wake up from. Not an experience you could call pleasurable or entertaining. \\n\\nCertainly the director had delusions of being Fellini but what you have is an embarrassing;y bad movie with a laughable last scene in which Lawrence is covered with fake looking make up meant to look like here charred remains. \\n\\nThe few people in the movie were checking their watches during the last 30 minutes.

You have to really pay attention to the reviews, like the ratio of one stars to five stars. Also, the free stuff is never really free. And I mean never. It's purely promotional. I've used wish for a little over a year now and jewelry that is now listed as free used to be $1 with $1 shipping and now it's free with $2 shipping, so... Yeah, it's pretty shitty.

LolP3Y7_Irs,hey nile do you think it's too late to start gymnastics at the age of nearly 15??\n\nEDIT: DAYUM 28 ON TRENDING LETS GO,2,2
LolP3Y7_Irs,"Nile , is there any way you could make a video giving advice to gymnasts like me who are finding it hard to resist quitting gymnastics and can't find much of a reason to stay in the sport :// I love the sport and couldn't imagine my life without it but I don't know wether to quit",1,3
LolP3Y7_Irs,Have you ever tried the carmona on rings?,1,1
LolP3Y7_Irs,I really want to do gymnastics but I have never done it before. I'm nearly 18 and feel like I won't be good enough to start gymnastics now. I'm not in the best of shape either. I know they do adult gymnastics by me at lillenshall but I feel like I won't be good enough or fit enough. Do yo have any advice or should I think Of something else to do.,1,2
LolP3Y7_Irs,"Hi Nile, I did gymnastics when I was younger but i was never flexible enough to advance to a higher level. It got to the point where my coach told my parents that they would have better luck spending their money elsewhere. I really loved it especially bars, because I am naturally strong and they were fun for me. I am now 17 and haven't done gymnastics for six years. Do you think it is possible for me to get back into it? Or do you think it's too late?",1,1

LolP3Y7_Irs,"Have you taken ballet?  You might investigate it, if not.  Bram Verhofstad moves like one, seems to actually slow time when he moves, it's thrilling to watch.  Somewhat like football player Lynn Swann, who was also a ballet student.  Your talent is so amazing, but it doesn't draw the eye in the same way.  Your movement could be not just thrilling, but breath-catchingly beautiful.",1,1

It's preference, u either like the freedom of Android with the set back of viruses and app issues or u like Apple and you like the integration and the security. Either way you are not caring about the price. Let's be honest if u like it u want it you can buy it you will. Humans like buying things that make them feel good. For some it's iPhone for some its Android. Who cares what someone else's spends on a phone it isn't your money. Android are coo if you like them. Personally I like my Apple product I like that everything is connected and what I can do on one I can pic up on the other and finish.

a41k9oJN0FI,Aronofsky makes weird as fuck movies all of which aren't as good as people say they are however I thought The Wrestler was fantastic and if he made more films like that I'd be a bigger fan of his... thank fuck that he didn't direct Wolverine. Mother was boring and too full of itself and was just plain mental but hey that's just my opinion.,0,0
a41k9oJN0FI,it does have depth but the symbolism was far from subtle. Metaphors/symbolism were a tad obvious and the movie hits you over the head with its messages. Yeah it's different and unique but that doesn't automatically make it a masterpiece. It's being called pretentious because it is. The ending gets so out there I couldn't help but laugh at that moment. Still thought it was okay and a decent watch though lol. The 68% score on RottenTomatoes.com is pretty accurate.,0,0

Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\\n\\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\\n\\nJesus said unto them,\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\\n\\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\\n\\nbut Jesus hid himself, \\nand went out of the temple,\\ngoing through the midst of them, \\nand so passed by.\\n\\n(John 8:58-59).\\n\\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\\n\\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\\n\\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\\n\\nThen answered Jesus \\nand said unto them,\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \\n\\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\\nfor what things soever he doeth, \\nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\\n\\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\\n\\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \\nand sheweth him all things \\nthat himself doeth:\\nand he will shew him \\ngreater works than these, \\nthat ye may marvel.\\n\\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\\n\\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \\nand quickeneth them; \\neven so the Son quickeneth \\nwhom he will.\\n\\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\\n\\n(John 5:19-21).",0,0

The one heads up was hearing Lawrence say The house represents earth.\\n\\nAfterwards, both of us left the theater thinking it was a swing and a miss. Almost every shot of Lawrence was a tight shot that totally filled the screen with her face. The two most relevant segments of the movie seemed like never ending nightmares you couldn't wake up from. Not an experience you could call pleasurable or entertaining. \\n\\nCertainly the director had delusions of being Fellini but what you have is an embarrassing;y bad movie with a laughable last scene in which Lawrence is covered with fake looking make up meant to look like here charred remains. \\n\\nThe few people in the movie were checking their watches during the last 30 minutes.

Several defensive players have improved greatly during the off-season including Bituli, Sapp, Warrior, Phillips, McKenzie, and Abernathy.

Jones has deceived the Vol faithful with gift of gab and lack of an ability to even coach at some kind of level. Offensively, Coach Scott has shown some promise. But unless he was directed by Jones, to not implement and under center snap for short yardage, he has no excuse. The list of inadequate, dysfunctional, unorganized and lack of using common sense is beyond words. These young men deserve better. These young men are some of the top talent in the country, 3-5 star recruits, all of them. They have trusted this coaching staff to prepare them to play at a higher level.

Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\\n\\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\\n\\nJesus said unto them,\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\\n\\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\\n\\nbut Jesus hid himself, \\nand went out of the temple,\\ngoing through the midst of them, \\nand so passed by.\\n\\n(John 8:58-59).\\n\\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\\n\\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\\n\\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\\n\\nThen answered Jesus \\nand said unto them,\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \\n\\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\\nfor what things soever he doeth, \\nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\\n\\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\\n\\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \\nand sheweth him all things \\nthat himself doeth:\\nand he will shew him \\ngreater works than these, \\nthat ye may marvel.\\n\\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\\n\\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \\nand quickeneth them; \\neven so the Son quickeneth \\nwhom he will.\\n\\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\\n\\n(John 5:19-21).",0,0

a41k9oJN0FI,"My wife and I saw the movie yesterday to a near empty Saturday showing. I purposely didn't read explanations beforehand so that I could form my own opinion. I mistakenly thought it was going to be a Rosemary's Baby kind of plot.  The one heads up was hearing Lawrence say The house represents earth.\\n\\nAfterwards, both of us left the theater thinking it was a swing and a miss. Almost every shot of Lawrence was a tight shot that totally filled the screen with her face. The two most relevant segments of the movie seemed like never ending nightmares you couldn't wake up from. Not an experience you could call pleasurable or entertaining. \\n\\nCertainly the director had delusions of being Fellini but what you have is an embarrassing;y bad movie with a laughable last scene in which Lawrence is covered with fake looking make up meant to look like here charred remains. \\n\\nThe few people in the movie were checking their watches during the last 30 minutes. Maybe worth watching on Netflix.",1,0

wB5Hek7Z2b8,"I don't understand how Mr. Cassidy's assertion that there is a family paying $40,000 for health insurance in LA because they have a daughter with special needs goes unchallenged.  Under current health care law, insurance companies cannot use medical history as part of the equation when figuring health insurance rates.  They are 5 factors they can take into account (age and location being probably the most important), but they cannot take medical history into account when setting rates.  Mr. Cassidy implies that this family is paying $40,000 for health care under the current plan because of their special needs daughter.  That is a lie.  That family would be offered basically the same plan as every other family in the same location where the ages of those covered are the same or similar.  Their daughter's medical condition would have nothing to do with their insurance rate.  So if there is one family paying $40,000 for health insurance in his state, there would be tons of families paying the same rate (it wouldn't matter that they don't have a special needs child--it's not part of the rate equation).  Since we haven't heard stories of thousands of families in LA paying this type of insurance rate, I have to conclude that the story is fake' it's a lie that plays well on TV as long as nobody really thinks about it.  I don't understand how this is not questioned in the media.  The ACA has issues and they need to be addressed.  But throwing out an entire health care program (that is popular in polling, especially when removed from the heat and bluster of campaign season) instead of fixing the issues that exist and helping those hurt by those issues makes no sense.  This is a political fix, not a policy fix.  Republicans want to pass this bill (or any bill) so they can point to some form of accomplishment.  That's it.  If you really wanted to help Americans and find a better way to provide health care in our country, you would certainly hold hearings and bring in the best minds in the health industry to take a look at your plan and get their input.  That has not been done and it says a lot about what the authors of this bill really think of their plan---they are not confident enough to have their public comments about the bill face scrutiny.  I honestly do not think that Americans want a child born with a heart condition or that contracts diabetes or cancer to have to worry about losing health insurance because they have a pre-existing condition or hit a lifetime maximum because of their disease or disability.  The country that leaps into raging water to save people in the flooding in Houston does not want that.  That's not who we are.  Families with children that have chronic diseases or disabilities already spend a much larger percentage of their income on health care (actual care, not insurance).  They also often have to make decisions about work or life that mean less income in the first place (a parent may have to forego employment because of the needs of their child, etc.).  These families already make less money than they might otherwise make and already pay far more for health care than families with healthy children.  Not to mention the overall burden of having a child that needs special care, or is fighting a very scary disease.  Burdening these families with higher insurance costs or denying their children health care because they hit a maximum is cruel.  There is no other way to look at it.  It's black and white.  These families did nothing wrong.  These children did nothing wrong.  Punishing them for having to endure disability/disease is evil.  That is not who we are.",0,0

Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \\nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\\n\\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\\n\\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\\n\\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\\n\\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\\n\\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\\n\\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\\n\\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\\n\\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\\n\\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\\n\\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\\n\\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\\n\\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \\n\\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\\n\\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",0,0

I listen to all of your songs, and I was at both concerts you had in the Czech Republic and have all your albums but lately I feel that the melody of the songs is repeated. It will come to me that you just edited the older song and put a new text on it. I understand that it's hard to come up with something new, but this song is too obvious to me. It's just my opinion.

But unless he was directed by Jones, to not implement and under center snap for short yardage, he has no excuse. The list of inadequate, dysfunctional, unorganized and lack of using common sense is beyond words. These young men deserve better. These young men are some of the top talent in the country, 3-5 star recruits, all of them. They have trusted this coaching staff to prepare them to play at a higher level.

Where voters have to take everything into consideration to decide which 2 out of the multiple teams should play in NCG...\\n       But, doing this so early in the season, especially when getting in the NCG isn't nearly as cutthroat as it was in bcs era:   Is totally trashy and unsportsmanlike.",0,0

kcTdfHXdRXo,"(((Homosexuality is an abomination before a Holy God. If they dont repent and stop doing this sinful act they will not inherit the kingdom of God. Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \\nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\\n\\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\\n\\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\\n\\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\\n\\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\\n\\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\\n\\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\\n\\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\\n\\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\\n\\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\\n\\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\\n\\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\\n\\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \\n\\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\\n\\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",0,0

It will come to me that you just edited the older song and put a new text on it. I understand that it's hard to come up with something new, but this song is too obvious to me. It's just my opinion.

Several defensive players have improved greatly during the off-season including Bituli, Sapp, Warrior, Phillips, McKenzie, and Abernathy.

Jones has deceived the Vol faithful with gift of gab and lack of an ability to even coach at some kind of level. Offensively, Coach Scott has shown some promise. But unless he was directed by Jones, to not implement and under center snap for short yardage, he has no excuse. The list of inadequate, dysfunctional, unorganized and lack of using common sense is beyond words. These young men deserve better. These young men are some of the top talent in the country, 3-5 star recruits, all of them. They have trusted this coaching staff to prepare them to play at a higher level. It is a sad day and the list of things wrong is way to long to list.",2,6

Where voters have to take everything into consideration to decide which 2 out of the multiple teams should play in NCG...\\n       But, doing this so early in the season, especially when getting in the NCG isn't nearly as cutthroat as it was in bcs era:   Is totally trashy and unsportsmanlike.",0,0

State, OSU...all of these schools would do the same in this position.",2,2
GMFnJln3IEA,Franklin did what he had to do. We all know it's hard enough for PSU to get to the national championship or gain ranking as it is. He preserved the shut out which in the power to be eyes is more impressive than a 56-3 victory. Way to go Franklin you did what was best for your program,1,2

tSRg5cFIxI0,Excellent plotline to follow the water uphill and the ridges down. I wish there was more downline but that was a good place to stop too. It would be interesting to see the trip in the opposite direction. Do you have the 'Rx' side of things recorded that you could post?,1,1
tSRg5cFIxI0,Sweepingly stunning! Very nicely done. What is the music?,1,1

tSRg5cFIxI0,"How did you mount the powercube in the Katana Frame? It looks like the srews holding the arm are the same holding the FC? With a Powercube, you cannot use four steel screws, and plastic ones won't be strong enough to hold the arm? This frame looks amazing!",1,1

kcTdfHXdRXo,"(((Homosexuality is an abomination before a Holy God. If they dont repent and stop doing this sinful act they will not inherit the kingdom of God. Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \\nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\\n\\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\\n\\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\\n\\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\\n\\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\\n\\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\\n\\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\\n\\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\\n\\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\\n\\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\\n\\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\\n\\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\\n\\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \\n\\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\\n\\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",0,0

tSRg5cFIxI0,"How did you mount the powercube in the Katana Frame? It looks like the srews holding the arm are the same holding the FC? With a Powercube, you cannot use four steel screws, and plastic ones won't be strong enough to hold the arm? This frame looks amazing!",1,1

tSRg5cFIxI0,Just sad it wasn't longer. Staggering performance from a small racing quad. Most high dollar aerial photography rigs would have trouble mimicking this quality.,1,1
tSRg5cFIxI0,Amazing! I don't know how you get such smooth and constant gentle motion. Perhaps low rates on a very locked-in frame. It's also nicely edited. The only weird thing is the unnatural distortion when yawing.,1,1
tSRg5cFIxI0,"incredible clip! are you still using reelsteady? I got a demo version but works very badly, are there special settings you use?",1,1
tSRg5cFIxI0,Excellent plotline to follow the water uphill and the ridges down. I wish there was more downline but that was a good place to stop too. It would be interesting to see the trip in the opposite direction. Do you have the 'Rx' side of things recorded that you could post?,1,1
tSRg5cFIxI0,"Man, this one's on a totally different level. Had to watch it four or five times through. Absolutely stunning final product; amazing work.",1,1
tSRg5cFIxI0,It is to beautiful to be real. Congrats man!!!! This should be played in a movie theater. What prop r u running?,1,1
tSRg5cFIxI0,I loved it! I would love to see the raw image from the fpv feed of what YOU see as you're doing long range flights over mountains.,1,1

End of story. Starting arguments over this is stupid and I pity people who argue over things like race or gender. We are all the same in spirit and we should all be treated the same.

Has come back with ptsd, and not enough alcohol in the world could drown those memories.. The national anthem is to remember these times. To remember the sacrifice someone else made so that we can be free, protest, and be who we are as Americans...

BNJUsE7pEs4,"For those of you who believe that this is some type of constitutional matter you are mistaken.

Just a little example, that you can't basically say what you want at the place of your employment, can you? Can you also practice your right to bear arms at your place of employment? Most of our places of employment do reserve the right to search our persons and property when on premises, correct? These athletes are free to express all the constitutional rights that they want when they are not at work representing their employers. In fact the NFL players manual section A 62 - 63 states that they shall all stand during the national anthem. If they don't like this then they never should have signed their contract. Just the same as if there are rules that we do not like about an employer we decide whether or not we want to work there. No matter how good intentioned these players are with their protest they will never convince the majority their intentions are valid. Just like trying to convincing people that the Confederate Battle Flag does not represent racism. It's also funny how this guy brings up what Chris Rock Says.

BNJUsE7pEs4,Well umm one  taking a knee during a national anthem or sitting down is a universal sign of disrespect in any country during a national anthem. Plus black people kill more black people wayyyy more than white people this also applies with white people. Out of of the 11  unarmed black people who were shot by police  8 of them were violent. Plus they stood up for God save rmthe queen who were the ones who took slaves to the Americas in the first place.  The USA anthem is supposed to represent unity and they might disagree with Trump but they do not have to take it out on the flag. Putting politics in sports is treating your fans as shit because the whole point of sports is to relax and watch people play rather politicizing everything. But they do have the right to protest but I still think it's shit what they are doing.,3,1

Mr. Kaepernick chose the gesture to alter an earlier one people felt signified disrespect, so he chose one from his sport [American football] that represents courtesy, respect and good manners. It is the Take a knee=the action taken at the end of the game to signify courtesy, sportsmanship and good manners. The problem lies in the historical aspect that for millenia kneeling has been a sign of subservience and subjection. The one key way one could tell a slave is he/she was forced to kneel if a non-slave demanded it, on pain of getting whipped down by their servants/bodyguards with no recourse to the law. It is something for which people in many cultures have died rather than permit be forced upon them. It was an extremely unfortunate choice for Mr. Kaepernick to make and for those knuckleheads who support his point to have adopted, as it goes against the common culture instilled in schools and the military that respect for the nation is tied up with honoring the flag and anthem, symbols of it, by a standing position facing it during its playing, which shows courtesy, respect, and good manners...as in during the Olympics or during multinational events for the several participants' countries. Neither set is being intentionally dissed so stop taking umbrage, agree on how to show a position without causing silly division and openings for the haters among us. BTW Trump did sort of say he had no problem with the linked arms bit. So OK Trumpie, put your money where your mouth is and stand with linked arms at some game. Just do it and you might gain some cred. Until then you are just pandering to the haters.",0,0

In my opinion moreso than kneeling in silence at our anthem. They did not act deliberately in disrespect for our standing army, or our constitution, but the developing of a police state and the inept American justice system, wich one cannot reasonably dispute, has a great deal of corruption and abuse. Regard the ideals and liberties our nation holds dear over talk of patriotism. Remember we are in the wake of scandals never before revealed in American history, do not divide yourselves, UNITE.",1,0

No horribly off center contraption made in  a terrible bandsaw contraption. \n\nWhy waste the life of an overpriced brushless drill? I guess if you have more money than intelligence it's okay but there are slow speed motors in all kinds of stuff. My microwave turntable motor would work. \n\nThis was painful.,0,1

Like Trump, he chose to ignore the actual issue and, instead, he throws fuel on the fire and causes further divisions.

BNJUsE7pEs4,"Dale puts it more eloquently than I ever could have, as I've been saying this since the scream-fests against the protests started. Some points that either he made already and/or that I'd like to emphasize further:\\n- We have a US flag code that ACTUALLY LAYS OUT what's considered disrespect toward the flag (although it's not law). Do you know what it says? We shouldn't carry the flag horizontally, wear it as apparel, use it for advertising, or made it part of a uniform. Yeah, about those...\\n- For anyone claiming that our veterans fight for the flag: no, they fight for the CONSTITUTION (and if you ARE a veteran, I do hope you understand this). The Constitution is the supreme law of the land, and that includes all of its 27 Amendments. The flag and the anthem are not what lay out the fundamental values that the US was founded on. Those can only be found in the Constitution.\\n- TRUE patriotism is about working to uphold and maintain the values laid out in the Constitution, NOT about waving a flag around and screaming at those who YOU perceive are disrespecting the flag (while at the same time likely disrespecting it yourself by WEARING it).",0,0

BNJUsE7pEs4,"Typical journalist who chose his field because he was too stupid to pass college algebra. Sports Reporters are worst because they have IQs one notch above pond scum.\\n\\n1. The NFL rule is NO POLITICAL or Special Interest demonstrations.  New York Giants players were not allowed to honor 9/11 families.  A  Player was not allowed to honor his mother who was suffering from Breast Cancer.  Dallas wanted to honor the 5 slain officers and they were shut down.\\n\\nIf the NFL shut those down, they have a legal obligation to shut those kneelers down as well. There is a legal DOL rule that you can't discriminate, rules must be enforced equally.   \\n\\nThis is not a first amendment issue.  Employees do not have a 1st Amendment right for anything while on the job. Go and tell your boss moron boy that you now support Trump. Bet you get fired. You speak your mind, you will be fired. \\n\\nThese protest began with the Ferguson shooting, HANDS UP DON'T SHOOT, narrative of a teenager gunned down while surrendering to a white cop.  This teenager was 6 inches taller than the cop and tried to take his gun. This teenager had committed a robbery 5 minutes before and this teen age did not surrender and it was found by The OBAMA DOJ, that t he shooting was justified.    Hands up don't shoot was a LIE. The who blood movement a lie. The BLM movement, which started just before the protests and are supported by the protests have been responsible for the death of at least 10 police officers. Why would anyone want to pay homage to that. Furthermore the excuse that the protest is to bring the spotlight to the racial divide is  ridiculous.  What I see is  bunch of black millionaires kneeling. That proves that there is a racial divide of spoiled brats.  Let's also remember that Obama was President for 8 years and this violence and protest happened while Obama was still in office. Trump caused nothing. Obama is the culprit that set back race relations 30 years.  \\n\\nWould you be defending their right to free speech if they held up Build the Wall or Abortion is murder signs? You wouldn't because you're a phony.\\n\\nWhat is obvious to those of us that have brains, Kaepernick walks around in a shirt with Che and Castro on it. The blank fool doesn't know that both of these men were rabidly racist.  This is the level of intellect we are dealing with.\\n\\nIf these players really feel our society is bad to blacks,\\n      Leave Football,  Study Law, Pass the bar, \\n      then run for DA or Judge. \\nWhy are Blacks not encouraged in public schools and colleges (which are ardently liberal) to study criminal justice and become police?  Wouldn't this also solve a lot of problems?  \\n\\nThey don't I think because African Americans don't want to, I don't know. They could if fix the problem. Since they don't seem to want to, then It is hard to believe there is a problem, except they are a bunch of neurotic paranoids who hate white people.",0,0
BNJUsE7pEs4,"We need a man like this to become our president. Whether you‚Äôre a trump supporter or not, let‚Äôs be real here. To this day, he continues to attack democrats for no purpose. Especially Hillary. Hillary lost the election to him almost a year ago and he still babbles in about her. Anything brought up by a democrat is immediately shot down by him. Not on the basis of whether it is bad or good but because it was simply proposed by someone not a republican. He‚Äôs too busy complaining about Hillary, or doing what he personally may think would be best completely disregarding what we think is best. Although many disagree with the utility of Obamacare, it‚Äôs covering 20,000,000 Americans who would otherwise have no health insurance. Should it be repealed, there‚Äôs no guarantee of what is actually going to happen to these people that lose coverage. The first time his new health care bill was denied he stated he would move on but he never did. He uses the term liberal as some sort of anarchist when in actuality a liberal in its simplest form is simply a more open minded person. So he has not really done much. Clearly Mr. Hansen is extremely capable at realistically assessing society and the problems going on right now and defends these people with valid reasoning, while trump is sitting in the highest position of our country complaining about NFL players and in no way contributing to productivity. If it were up to Trump he‚Äôd fire them all simply because he can, which would be oppressing our right to free speech. #HansenForPresident2020",0,0

Do these idiots think anything will change because they stage some protest?  Not hardly.  Did Tommie Smith and John Carlos change a single thing with their black power fists at the 1968 Mexico Olympics?  Nope and all it did was get them sent home early.  These rich athletes want to do something?  Then urge young blacks to get a good education.  Maybe they should spend some of those millions they get paid and support tutors in the poor black inner city neighborhoods.  How about becoming highly visible role models for black youth of the value of hard work?  As it stands the backlash is going to do more harm to the NFL and the protest is not going to change a single thing in the lives of black youth.  \\n\\nOh, the 1st amendment only prevents government from preventing your free speech.

Both sides argue for freedom of expression which is exactly trump is trying to quash. From my understanding the protest is linked the treatment of African Americans by police but Trump (as he has many times before) deflects through clever use (i'm not saying its right but it works for him) of PR and media to turn the issue on its head to create division. \\n\\nThe things I see people (from both sides) arguing/highlighting about below are not about the factual comments Hansen makes (eg trumps statement on peaceful protests, which he obviously negates by using the power of his office to attack what is by definition a peaceful protest) but around the anecdotal comments Hansen makes which are just heresay (My foot hurt too in Vietnam etc etc.). People who support / do not support these comments then refute/agree with them through further use of anecdotes i.e my x family member or friend served and this is what they think or Go get 'em Hansen, sick burn on trump avoiding the draft and the spiral begins. \\n\\nWhat saddens me most is the license this type of behavior by the world's biggest superpower has given to the rest of western culture (and of course these are the nations that call them minorities (correct from a technical standpoint) who are actually the world's majority - we are one species people!) to rationlise inequality through denial, supriority complexes and a victim mindset that is totally undeserved. You see fracturing in Western Europe, UK,  Australia where aging populations have their outdated views on the world not only galvanized but passed onto the next generation (think about the new emboldened sense of purpose that Neo-nazis now posses, across the globe not just in the USA). I'm not saying that if you are from the right you are nazi, im sure that couldn't be further from the truth for the vast majority, but you have to understand that they (the neo-nazis/the bigots the racists) use right leaning rhetoric take their message mainstream and shit like this NFL stunt that Trump has pulled to deflect a real issue into an issue about patriotism that paints African American athletes as the enemy who should be fired for not doing their job or respecting their country, is only fuel that fire.

pkWafXW55eA,Tamar needs to go back to the hair and makeup she was rockin when she was on DWTS. She's looking WAAAAAAY overdone here. Too much of everything. She's naturally pretty.,16,0
pkWafXW55eA,Tamar needs to separate her marriage and her career. Vince can do a lot for Lady Gaga but do so little for Tamar's. Tamar been wanting to sing for YEARSS and he didn't give her a chance . Tamar should've brought her business elsewhere.,12,0

pkWafXW55eA,So stop what you love doing??? No go get a new manger fuck that shit. This whole she been sad about not having a singing career now you wanna let it all go?!?,15,1
pkWafXW55eA,Ugh.. so Vince that controlling that she can't do music no More coz he a bitch ass??. Really??.. I sense abuse when on the episode of they show when she was giving birth and wanted a c section coz of whatever reason. He said no she said but vince..he whispered something in her ear and told them to cut the cameras off and leave.. omg.. Tamar can do better but his abusive ways got her thinking she can't.  Bluebird of happiness. I will be getting that album coz she's amaze balls. But .girl.. blue birds are free.. be free and fly fly fly away.... ~fly away now Clarice...fly fly fly...‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§,21,2
pkWafXW55eA,"No man is worth your career. If you have a man that will let you live your dream vice versa he‚Äôs not the man for you. Your dream was to be a singer, Tamar.

pkWafXW55eA,"Okay, listen. Tamar has a god given gift. Her throat was BLESSED. It‚Äôs disrespectful to not use that gift. How many people out there would kill to have the opportunity put out records and have their voice heard by the world? She can‚Äôt take her blessings/opportunities for granted. If music is causing friction in your marriage, Vince needs to step down as your manager & just be a husband. Tamar could have herself another manager tomorrow if she made the call. I truly hope that she takes a year or two off & comes back with another album. I‚Äôve been a long time viewer of BFV and Tamar and Vince and we‚Äôve seen how hard she had to fight just to get Love & War put out. Why give up & quit now? You got a lot of years left in you tamar. Don‚Äôt do something you‚Äôll regret.",2,0
pkWafXW55eA,"silly. so she is being a martyr then? she'd rather sacrifice her own individual passion to save her relationship with her man? why doesn't she just have someone else manage her music day-to-day, create music when she is in the right head space and time? oh, shes going to sacrifice herself to be an obedient housewife? got it.",2,0
pkWafXW55eA,Seems like (1) Vince owns a huge portion the label-- hence why it's LoganLand versus TamartianLand; (2) Album sales aren't projected to be that high; (3) Vince owns the rights to all things Tamar Braxton and he's probably pulled the plug on her career until they get the marriage together-- which may or may not happen. So she won't release another album because he gets paid for‚Äã her either way.,1,0
pkWafXW55eA,Omg does anyone know if she'll be back on the real???,3,2

pkWafXW55eA,"Tamar is a great singer. But girl bye! I'm seeing right through this facade... didn't her big sister Toni announce she would do her last album as well? I think Toni went back to singing.... I think Tamar will be heading in that direction. I'm sorry that your last album didn't do so well Tamar, but seriously it's no need to front to get more sales. I'm sorry, if you're not THE HOTTEST thing in music today, your albums will always not do so well. It's Just that more and more people aren't really buying music today... unless you on some Beyonce, Rihanna, Jay Z, Nicki , Dj kaled type level.... again Tamar, you have a wonderful voice!

BNJUsE7pEs4,"Black culture is the inverse/negation/shadow of white culture. Black culture was created by white culture. This has been going on since Medieval Europe. Yin and Yang, Red and Blue, Sun and moon...energetic polarities. Black culture is the refuse of white culture. When one group(class) of people are given rights, privileges, resources and basic human respect at the EXPENSE of another group of people, those who are denied create a culture that is a reflection of no rights, no privileges, no resources and no basic human respect. In essence the black race was never socially or culturally restored after slavery. There are no rites of passage in black culture. Blacks in America are not allowed to have institutions that openly compete with white institutions (hence Reconstruction and Jim Crow). If blacks want to enjoy the fruits of their labor in America, a white person must benefit even moreso (sports, entertainment, academia). Black people have absolutely no control of how resources are allocated in America. There are no black governors, no black Senators. Black people do not have any wealth. All of the major black institutions are controlled by whites and Jews. Blacks do not write the curriculum for their children in school...Everything they know is what white society wants them to know.  Blacks do not write the laws, manufacture the guns, or smuggle in the drugs that ravage their communities.  They are a victim of massive systemic structural violence which mars their ability to make sound, productive and progressive choices. I'm sure you're familiar with the allegory of the cave.  If a man only sees poverty, destruction, fear and injustice around him, how is he supposed to do otherwise without outside intervention? By the time he is of the age to reach that outside intervention, he is psychologically scarred by decades of abuse and neglect at the hands of his own community and the larger society. #CulturalDeterminism\\n\\nIf you develop a software application that is a virus, who is to blame? The developer or the virus? Black people never had the opportunity to override the virus that was installed into their culture since slavery. Ever. Culture is the DNA of the tribe, it gets passed down from generation to generation.  Blacks speak the language of enslavement, by their very STATUS as stateless persons (Black is not a nationality or race) Whites admit that there is a DISTINCTION which denotes a difference in treatment and rights. If white privilege doesn't exist there would be no need for the color caste system here in America. But we all know why caste systems are created. If we're all Americans what's the need for black and white classifications?  \\n\\nWhite people need to stop acting like they don't know what the fuck is going on. The jig is up.",0,0

BNJUsE7pEs4,"Right. So if people started burning the Quran outside the front door to a Mosque during the calls prayer would that also be an acceptable way to protest against Islam? It wouldn't be about disrespecting the book but a protest against what it stands for. Or, maybe sit outside an abortion clinic with a huge sign showing the gruesome remains of an aborted fetus to young woman as they go to fulfill such a difficult choice? It wouldn't be about disrespecting the women but about bringing awareness to the other side of the debate. \\n\\nJust like kneeling in the case of the NFL those examples are disrespectful regardless of intent. They are provocative demonstrations designed to agitate... it may be permitted but it doesn't make it right. Yes people have a right to free speech but is it always necessary to be so divisive in the demonstration? There are ways to peacefully protest without widening the divide. How about players refuse to actually play while injustice is going on? Of course, that would never happen because they aren't really interested in solutions, just outrage.",1,0

Sadly, COLOR of the SKIN and WHAT TO DO WITH THE PEOPLE OF COLOR has always been an Issue in this country. For too long we have avoided the RACE ISSUE and second class citizenship has been accepted through CIVIL RIGHTS while HUMAN RIGHTS  for people of color is null and void  - generally speaking. The peaceful , non-violent kneeling by the NFL players and associates is not disrespecting the flag and the reason that they are doing this - to bring attention to the  inhumane treatment of blacks , needs to be resolved. Ultimately it is going to take an ACT OF GOD. The removal of  Confederate statues does not change the HEARTS OF MEN... We must TRY.... When was America great ?",0,0

BNJUsE7pEs4,"Ret. Marine Col. Jeffery Powers wrote to the NFL commissioners the following:\\n\\n \\nCommissioners,\\nI've been a season pass holder at Yankee Stadium, Yale Bowl and the Giants Stadium.\\n\\n \\nI missed the '90-'91 season because I was with a battalion of Marines in Desert Storm. 14 of my wonderful Marines returned home with the American Flag draped across their lifeless bodies. My last conversation with one of them, Sgt. Garrett Mongrella, was about how our Giants were going to the Super Bowl. He never got to see it.\\n\\n \\nMany friends, Marines, and Special Forces Soldiers who worked with or for me through the years returned home with the American Flag draped over their coffins.\\n\\n \\nNow I watch multi-millionaire athletes who never did anything in their lives but play a game, disrespect what brave Americans fought and died for. They are essentially spitting in the faces and on the graves of real men, men who have actually done something for this country beside playing with a ball and believing they're something special! They're not! My Marines and Soldiers were!\\n\\n \\nYou are complicit in this! You'll fine players for large and small infractions but you lack the moral courage and respect for our nation and the fallen to put an  immediate stop to this. Yes, I know, it's their 1st Amendment right to behave in such a despicable manner.\\n\\n \\nWhat would happen if they came out and disrespected you or the refs publicly?\\n\\n \\nI observed a player getting a personal foul for twerking in the end zone after scoring. I guess that's much worse than disrespecting the flag and our National  Anthem. Hmmmmm, isn't it his 1st Amendment right to express himself like an idiot in the end zone?\\n\\n \\nWhy is taunting not allowed yet taunting America is OK? You fine players for wearing 9-11 commemorative shoes yet you allow scum on the sidelines to sit, kneel or pump their pathetic fist in the air. They are so deprived with their multi-million dollar contracts for playing a freaking game!\\n\\n \\nYou condone it all by your refusal to act. You're just as bad and disgusting as they are. I hope Americans boycott any sponsor who supports that rabble you call the NFL. I hope they turn off the TV when any team that allowed this disrespect to occur, without consequence, on the sidelines. I applaud those who have not.\\n\\n \\nLegends and heroes do NOT wear shoulder pads. They wear body armor and carry rifles.\\nThey make minimum wage and spend months and years away from their families. They don't do it for an hour on Sunday. They do it 24/7 often with lead, not footballs, coming in their direction. They watch their brothers carted off in pieces not on a gurney to get their knee iced. They don't even have ice! Many don't have legs or arms.\\n\\n \\nSome wear blue and risk their lives daily on the streets of America. They wear fire helmets and go upstairs into the fire rather than down to safety. On 9-11, hundreds vanished. They are the heroes.\\n\\n \\nI hope that your high paid protesting pretty boys and you look in that mirror when you shave tomorrow and see what you really are, legends in your own minds. You need to hit the road and take those worms with you!\\n\\n \\nTime to change the channel.",1,0

BNJUsE7pEs4,"Yes, others do disrespect the flag. From my humble view - it would be like a male walking into my church with his hat on - it‚Äôs disrespectful.  I can guarantee 100% of our veterans never took a knee during their oath to uphold freedom or pay the ultimate sacrifice.",1,0
BNJUsE7pEs4,Hansen you are like CNN spreading misinformation and hate.  The President did not mention black athletes.  He mentioned players who take a knee. Just because you speak eloquently does not mean you are not distorting facts.  Taking a knee was started to protest police brutality against African Americans.  People like you who have a large audience distort the truth and facts and create hate.  Wish people would look up the facts instead of listening to the propaganda you preach.,1,0
BNJUsE7pEs4,"I think you need to read your Constution again. I am a Veteran as well. The supposed nazi's walking around with their flag is protected under the first amendment as well. Same with their speech. So why are you trying to stop them from speaking? Everyone has a right to protest, yet not on private property. People are sick of everything being political. Funny how Mueller did his investigation into the NFL and then they go far left. It's because of the concussion issue. The NFL has signed on to the globalist system. For me I am done, you can see the propaganda a mile away. Trying to compare this to MLK is a joke. Black on black crime is the biggest problem, look at Chicago and Detroit. Or how the abortion rate of 35% is much higher in their population. Those are the real issues, yet you will here nothing about it. Wake up people, this is all part of the plan.",1,0

A welder or biker wearing a flag bandana is wearing an image of our flag, not the flag (and i would venture to say the reason they do is out of a national pride.)  There is no national anthem being played nor millions of people watching while they wear their bandana or bathing suit. Save your holier-than-thou attitude. If you served and think this way, you did not do so honorably. Try not saluting your superior officers, standing at attention for reveille or retreat.  With any rights there follows responsibility. When we focus on our rights and not our responsibilities we have failed democracy. As for being white and having an advantage you are mistaken. Sports, music, business, entertainment,  politics and even the presidency have all colors not just white.

MHzktkbjDOE,"I would love to see one of these budget rooms for maybe a Rustic or Cozy Cabin living room or bedroom‚ù§Ô∏è My mom is going through a divorce and if she gets to keep the home, I would love to eventually help her redecorate it to her taste.. she had been a stay at home wife/ mother for the past 15 years; but when my stepdad left her, she had to get to work, to pay bills and  keep the home. She is a waitress because the tips are the only way she can afford the bills. Me, I currently work part-time at a local Floral shop due to lack of job opportunities in my small town... So anything we do to the house has to be on a budget. Also, due to the fact it is a small town in northern Nevada, our thrift pickings are very limited. So any DIYs would be wonderful to know! My mom told me that she loves romantic/ cozy Country.. the pictures she showed me were warm-lighted lodges and cabins with deep colored wood furniture, some had cedar log pieces. Lots of leather, plaid, fleece, fur and cable-knit pillows and throws in cream, tan, Marsala/deep red, brown and sage. The accessories were shabby wood signs and metal stars and arrows, old rusted lanterns,  metal buckets... just lots of neat old/rustic/ primative pieces. You figure out here in the ol' west, we have tons of that kind of old country stuff everywhere, but we don't. Lol. Some boutiques and antique shops do, but they want a pretty penny for them. Lol. But yeah, even if you can't do a video of a budget Romantic, Rustic Country Cabin any DIY or advice would always be greatly appreciated ‚ù§Ô∏è\\nAnyways, love this room!

Whites are dying from heroin, meth, cocaine and opioid overdoses in record numbers. In fact, more white people have died from drug overdoses in the last 3 years than have died in the Vietnam war. The White mortality rate has exploded whereas the Black mortality rate has decreased. White men are committing suicides at epidemic rates. White males account for 77% of all suicides in America.  This is a major problem. The White on White homicide rate is 89% and climbing. White America is on the decline morally, spiritually and economically. A few white American parents have confessed that thy don't feel connected to their teens and a myriad of white teens say that they feel alienated from their parents. Moreover, many white American households have been torn apart because of divorce. The White divorce rate is at a staggering 57%.  Sadly, over the last 3 years, there has been an increase in the number of cases of white youth who have snapped and killed their parents. Many young white folks feel despair and hopelessness. More importantly, white youth, and youth in general, are distracted by technology. There is an information overload due to social media. Many so called conservative Whites tend to feel that Blacks, minorities, Jewish people, leftist ideology and BLM are the problem with AMERICA. They fail to look inward or look at the bigger picture.

BNJUsE7pEs4,"The first article of the Bill Of Rights, 1st amendment, guarantees all Americans that their right to free speech would not be abridged (shorten, cut, cut short, cut down, curtail, truncate, trim, crop, clip, pare down, prune). However,¬†when you or anyone else in the mass media or the entertainment industry¬†control and use the mass media machine to state your well planned and orchestrated opinions, well... that abridges the Right of EQUAL FREE SPEECH AND EXPRESSION of most of Americans.When the average American is compelled to protest against what they believe to be unjust they take it to the street, just like Martin Luther King did, not onto a athletic field, a concert stage, a News/Sports program. The average American¬†does not have the media machine to mass distribute their opinions as you and other entertainers and showman¬†do.You made it very clear in your video rant that if any American does not agree with¬†what you say¬†about this protest then they do not understand America or the freedoms guaranteed them.You stated that if someone doesn't agree with your opinion of oppression then they do not understand.¬† I have personal experience regarding oppression and disrespect. My\\ngrandparents, of mixed lineage (German and Native American Indian) endured\\ngross disrespect and oppression from vicious bigots because of their marriage\\ntogether. These attacks continued on against their children. Through their lifetime they¬†continued growing cotton and peanuts proudly. They all endured and overcame the racial disrespect and oppression because the stood together as an American Family and stood their ground. Don't tell me I don't understand oppression.While a lot of viewers rely on you and others like you to decided what they should believe, most Americans are actually smart enough to make their own decisions, and by the way, a lot of Americans have read the US Constitution. Your suggestion that¬†if someone does not agree with your comments, they must not understand what America is and is in need of¬†a refresher course on¬†the US Constitution to¬†enlighten¬†themselves¬†with the truth, as you see it.People like you have become the new, self appointed, Pundits of truth and fact. That really worries me for the people of America. You are a good and well seasoned sports caster, however when I want to witness a performance by an actor, showman,¬†athlete or sports news caster I pay for it and expect nothing else. When I want an update to sports scores, I don't want¬†you or anyone else to use that time,¬†and your mass media machine, to unequally claim a right to free speech so you can decide for others what they should believe.\\nWhen you have a¬†grievance or¬†an opinion, do what most Americans do...take it to the streets. Don't use your advantage to diminish or overwhelm the grievances and opinions of other good Americans.To sum up my opinion...You have a great responsibility, as do all Americans, to uphold the hopes, dreams and ideals of our founding fathers. You must understand also that when you speak your machine amplifies your voice across the nation. This is an advantage that robs other Americans of their EQUAL GARUANTEED RIGHTS. A Right is a Right until it takes away from equal rights of other.Reassess your job...BE RESPONSIBLE!!",1,0

BNJUsE7pEs4,"Black culture is the inverse/negation/shadow of white culture. Black culture was created by white culture. This has been going on since Medieval Europe. Yin and Yang, Red and Blue, Sun and moon...energetic polarities. Black culture is the refuse of white culture. When one group(class) of people are given rights, privileges, resources and basic human respect at the EXPENSE of another group of people, those who are denied create a culture that is a reflection of no rights, no privileges, no resources and no basic human respect. In essence the black race was never socially or culturally restored after slavery. There are no rites of passage in black culture. Blacks in America are not allowed to have institutions that openly compete with white institutions (hence Reconstruction and Jim Crow). If blacks want to enjoy the fruits of their labor in America, a white person must benefit even moreso (sports, entertainment, academia). Black people have absolutely no control of how resources are allocated in America. There are no black governors, no black Senators. Black people do not have any wealth. All of the major black institutions are controlled by whites and Jews. Blacks do not write the curriculum for their children in school...Everything they know is what white society wants them to know.  Blacks do not write the laws, manufacture the guns, or smuggle in the drugs that ravage their communities.  They are a victim of massive systemic structural violence which mars their ability to make sound, productive and progressive choices. I'm sure you're familiar with the allegory of the cave.  If a man only sees poverty, destruction, fear and injustice around him, how is he supposed to do otherwise without outside intervention? By the time he is of the age to reach that outside intervention, he is psychologically scarred by decades of abuse and neglect at the hands of his own community and the larger society. #CulturalDeterminism\\n\\nIf you develop a software application that is a virus, who is to blame? The developer or the virus? Black people never had the opportunity to override the virus that was installed into their culture since slavery. Ever. Culture is the DNA of the tribe, it gets passed down from generation to generation.  Blacks speak the language of enslavement, by their very STATUS as stateless persons (Black is not a nationality or race) Whites admit that there is a DISTINCTION which denotes a difference in treatment and rights. If white privilege doesn't exist there would be no need for the color caste system here in America. But we all know why caste systems are created. If we're all Americans what's the need for black and white classifications?  \\n\\nWhite people need to stop acting like they don't know what the fuck is going on. The jig is up.",0,0

Jeffery Powers wrote to the NFL commissioners the following:\\n\\n \\nCommissioners,\\nI've been a season pass holder at Yankee Stadium, Yale Bowl and the Giants Stadium.\\n\\n \\nI missed the '90-'91 season because I was with a battalion of Marines in Desert Storm. 14 of my wonderful Marines returned home with the American Flag draped across their lifeless bodies. My last conversation with one of them, Sgt. Garrett Mongrella, was about how our Giants were going to the Super Bowl. He never got to see it.\\n\\n \\nMany friends, Marines, and Special Forces Soldiers who worked with or for me through the years returned home with the American Flag draped over their coffins.\\n\\n \\nNow I watch multi-millionaire athletes who never did anything in their lives but play a game, disrespect what brave Americans fought and died for. They are essentially spitting in the faces and on the graves of real men, men who have actually done something for this country beside playing with a ball and believing they're something special! They're not! My Marines and Soldiers were!\\n\\n \\nYou are complicit in this! You'll fine players for large and small infractions but you lack the moral courage and respect for our nation and the fallen to put an  immediate stop to this. Yes, I know, it's their 1st Amendment right to behave in such a despicable manner.\\n\\n \\nWhat would happen if they came out and disrespected you or the refs publicly?\\n\\n \\nI observed a player getting a personal foul for twerking in the end zone after scoring. I guess that's much worse than disrespecting the flag and our National  Anthem. Hmmmmm, isn't it his 1st Amendment right to express himself like an idiot in the end zone?\\n\\n \\nWhy is taunting not allowed yet taunting America is OK? You fine players for wearing 9-11 commemorative shoes yet you allow scum on the sidelines to sit, kneel or pump their pathetic fist in the air. They are so deprived with their multi-million dollar contracts for playing a freaking game!\\n\\n \\nYou condone it all by your refusal to act. You're just as bad and disgusting as they are. I hope Americans boycott any sponsor who supports that rabble you call the NFL. I hope they turn off the TV when any team that allowed this disrespect to occur, without consequence, on the sidelines. I applaud those who have not.\\n\\n \\nLegends and heroes do NOT wear shoulder pads. They wear body armor and carry rifles.\\nThey make minimum wage and spend months and years away from their families. They don't do it for an hour on Sunday. They do it 24/7 often with lead, not footballs, coming in their direction. They watch their brothers carted off in pieces not on a gurney to get their knee iced. They don't even have ice! Many don't have legs or arms.\\n\\n \\nSome wear blue and risk their lives daily on the streets of America. They wear fire helmets and go upstairs into the fire rather than down to safety. On 9-11, hundreds vanished. They are the heroes.\\n\\n \\nI hope that your high paid protesting pretty boys and you look in that mirror when you shave tomorrow and see what you really are, legends in your own minds. You need to hit the road and take those worms with you!\\n\\n \\nTime to change the channel.",1,0

BNJUsE7pEs4,If you aren't standing with your hand over your heart during the anthem you should move to North Korea and go be free there.,1,3
BNJUsE7pEs4,Dude instead of protesting on my tax payer dime they should roll up their sleeves in their communities and be a Light. My tax payer Dollars supplement these Stadium builds and upgrades. I don't watch a game to have someone disrespect this nations Flag and Anthem. If it's so bad here then take your millions and leave ! I did my time in the Military as well. It's a sand lot game you get the privilege of getting paid more than 95 % of Americans will ever make. If it keeps up I'll find better people and places to spend my time and money on !,1,1

BNJUsE7pEs4,"In simple and short terms, the way I see it is if one is unhappy with a situation, then as Martin Luther King did, peacefully protest that situation and not the country that gives you the freedom to have that protest peacefully. The flag hasn't failed us...the situation and its people has. Remember, we are one nation under God indivisible with liberty and justice for all. Yes, the words sound grand and throughout history there have been many struggles by many groups of people. The Irish, Italians, Jews, Chinese, Blacks, Hispanics, gays, women, etc all found themselves in the back seat at some point. But our country which is one of the greatest experiments in history has endured and that flag still waves. We should honor that flag and stand united under it.  The sad truth is we are not a perfect nation and the injustices of the past have left many with scars both emotional and physical. Thankfully we are in a country whose backbone is one of democracy and rights. It is because of that backbone that we have moved past slavery, have allowed women to vote, and to actually have a Black man as president. It is the flag and our Anthem that supports that backbone. Imagine living in North Korea or Iran. Their backbone is totalitarianism. What progress have their people made in the past 60 years. For me, our flag is the glue that bonds us together as ONE Nation and allows us to find the path for justice and liberty for all...Even if it doesn't happen overnight!",0,0

The White mortality rate has exploded whereas the Black mortality rate has decreased. White men are committing suicides at epidemic rates. White males account for 77% of all suicides in America.  This is a major problem. The White on White homicide rate is 89% and climbing. White America is on the decline morally, spiritually and economically. A few white American parents have confessed that thy don't feel connected to their teens and a myriad of white teens say that they feel alienated from their parents. Moreover, many white American households have been torn apart because of divorce. The White divorce rate is at a staggering 57%.  Sadly, over the last 3 years, there has been an increase in the number of cases of white youth who have snapped and killed their parents. Many young white folks feel despair and hopelessness. More importantly, white youth, and youth in general, are distracted by technology. There is an information overload due to social media. Many so called conservative Whites tend to feel that Blacks, minorities, Jewish people, leftist ideology and BLM are the problem with AMERICA. They fail to look inward or look at the bigger picture.

BNJUsE7pEs4,"Black culture is the inverse/negation/shadow of white culture. Black culture was created by white culture. This has been going on since Medieval Europe. Yin and Yang, Red and Blue, Sun and moon...energetic polarities. Black culture is the refuse of white culture. When one group(class) of people are given rights, privileges, resources and basic human respect at the EXPENSE of another group of people, those who are denied create a culture that is a reflection of no rights, no privileges, no resources and no basic human respect. In essence the black race was never socially or culturally restored after slavery. There are no rites of passage in black culture. Blacks in America are not allowed to have institutions that openly compete with white institutions (hence Reconstruction and Jim Crow). If blacks want to enjoy the fruits of their labor in America, a white person must benefit even moreso (sports, entertainment, academia). Black people have absolutely no control of how resources are allocated in America. There are no black governors, no black Senators. Black people do not have any wealth. All of the major black institutions are controlled by whites and Jews. Blacks do not write the curriculum for their children in school...Everything they know is what white society wants them to know.  Blacks do not write the laws, manufacture the guns, or smuggle in the drugs that ravage their communities.  They are a victim of massive systemic structural violence which mars their ability to make sound, productive and progressive choices. I'm sure you're familiar with the allegory of the cave.  If a man only sees poverty, destruction, fear and injustice around him, how is he supposed to do otherwise without outside intervention? By the time he is of the age to reach that outside intervention, he is psychologically scarred by decades of abuse and neglect at the hands of his own community and the larger society. #CulturalDeterminism\\n\\nIf you develop a software application that is a virus, who is to blame? The developer or the virus? Black people never had the opportunity to override the virus that was installed into their culture since slavery. Ever. Culture is the DNA of the tribe, it gets passed down from generation to generation.  Blacks speak the language of enslavement, by their very STATUS as stateless persons (Black is not a nationality or race) Whites admit that there is a DISTINCTION which denotes a difference in treatment and rights. If white privilege doesn't exist there would be no need for the color caste system here in America. But we all know why caste systems are created. If we're all Americans what's the need for black and white classifications?  \\n\\nWhite people need to stop acting like they don't know what the fuck is going on. The jig is up.",0,0

However,¬†when you or anyone else in the mass media or the entertainment industry¬†control and use the mass media machine to state your well planned and orchestrated opinions, well... that abridges the Right of EQUAL FREE SPEECH AND EXPRESSION of most of Americans.When the average American is compelled to protest against what they believe to be unjust they take it to the street, just like Martin Luther King did, not onto a athletic field, a concert stage, a News/Sports program. The average American¬†does not have the media machine to mass distribute their opinions as you and other entertainers and showman¬†do.You made it very clear in your video rant that if any American does not agree with¬†what you say¬†about this protest then they do not understand America or the freedoms guaranteed them.You stated that if someone doesn't agree with your opinion of oppression then they do not understand.¬† I have personal experience regarding oppression and disrespect. My\\ngrandparents, of mixed lineage (German and Native American Indian) endured\\ngross disrespect and oppression from vicious bigots because of their marriage\\ntogether. These attacks continued on against their children. Through their lifetime they¬†continued growing cotton and peanuts proudly. They all endured and overcame the racial disrespect and oppression because the stood together as an American Family and stood their ground. Don't tell me I don't understand oppression.While a lot of viewers rely on you and others like you to decided what they should believe, most Americans are actually smart enough to make their own decisions, and by the way, a lot of Americans have read the US Constitution. Your suggestion that¬†if someone does not agree with your comments, they must not understand what America is and is in need of¬†a refresher course on¬†the US Constitution to¬†enlighten¬†themselves¬†with the truth, as you see it.People like you have become the new, self appointed, Pundits of truth and fact. That really worries me for the people of America.

When I want an update to sports scores, I don't want¬†you or anyone else to use that time,¬†and your mass media machine, to unequally claim a right to free speech so you can decide for others what they should believe.\\nWhen you have a¬†grievance or¬†an opinion, do what most Americans do...take it to the streets. Don't use your advantage to diminish or overwhelm the grievances and opinions of other good Americans.To sum up my opinion...You have a great responsibility, as do all Americans, to uphold the hopes, dreams and ideals of our founding fathers. You must understand also that when you speak your machine amplifies your voice across the nation. This is an advantage that robs other Americans of their EQUAL GARUANTEED RIGHTS.

Yes, we all know that guns are the most evil things, and that getting rid of guns definitely wouldn't be impossible and wouldn't leave a giant void for knives, blunt weapon and bombs to fill. Right. Also the reason we should wait to talk about guns is because since our countries founding guns have been an important and sacred tool, unlike you, it stands for something for me personally. So trying to rush out a permanent era changing law while emotions are high for a country that has held guns to such of important, is well frankly. That's kind of retarded",0,0

Its funny how in my critical analysis english class (from California), when we were reading an article on gun control,  I was the only person who said I don't see the point of guns.  All they do is inflict pain.   Am I the only person who sees this?  Yes , I get that theres SO many guns in the U.S. and that its going to take a long time to get rid of them all but pretending there isn't a problem when there clearly is and refusing to do anything just because its threatening your ability to own firearms is ridiculous.

j9UGpBZz7WU,"About spanish, catal√°n and catalanistas. Other side of the story. Breaking peace and solidarity.\\nYes I care and feel indignated that they are breaking the peace, they want to break the democracy, they are breaking the solidarity, they are breaking emotions. That is what the catalanistas are doing.\\nCatalan or catalanista is not the same.\\nCatalan by birth or adoption is a person who lives in Catalu√±a or other parts of the country, is someone who, pleased and proud to be from Catalu√±a, appreciates, respects and shares with the rest of the Spanish citizens. Catalan is someone who respects the democratic majority of Spain, is someone who knows that unity is strength.\\nCatalanist is someone who acts in a very different way to a Catalan. To begin with, Catalanists are a minority, in Catalu√±a and Spain. The catalanistas only look at their navel at the expense of everything and everyone else that is not them. Their flag inestead of star simbols should have money simbols. The money they do not want to share with the less favored parts of Spain. Catalanistas are a caste that considered itself superior and above the rest of Spanish people, millions of Catalans included. The origen of this cast is in the bourgeois class.\\nCatalans are the ones who sow contempt and hatred between Catalans and Spaniards. They are the ones that make a lot of noise, because they are a minority and need to pretend a reality bigger than themselves.\\nThe results that are now occurring are the basic cause and responsibility of the acts that the Catalanists are imposing amongst their families, their friends, their co-workers and the rest of the Spanish, bigger and more important wounds that can not be cured in hospitals or emergencies.\\nSpain is a democracy that at the beginning of its creation General Tejero tried to break up, he was also seconded by many Spaniards. Now the catalanistas want to do the sime. It was not allowed then, it canot be permited now. Polls can`t be done whenever minorities want it, because the majority have already voted to get the Spanish country we have.\\nIn the 21st century with a Europe eliminating important frontiers, Catalanists want to build the most painful border, this is a clear setback in the objectives of the Europe that most of us want and voted for.\\nThe reality is that we must respect the majority, specially when this majority also maintain objectives of peace, solidarity, unity, economic and emotional well-being.",0,0

Look at the war on drugs as an example of how regulation has failed; How many laws, regulations, and severe consequences have we imposed on illegal drug users and how many people still die every day of drug use? The solution to this problem shouldn't and cannot be regulation, rather, we as a society need to stop being so fucking depressing, negative, and divided.

The man has a level head and is intelligent. He doesn't kiss any politicians butt; he doesn't seem to be in anybody's pocket ( I do understand that the man comes from big oil, but he advocated for renewable energy when Dump backed out of the Paris Climate Accord, which must say something). This is a dark time in our country and somehow we are letting this despot to continue to govern the U.S. We are a laughing stock of the world, we are in an extremely dangerous position with N.

I need someone to explain to me when it was that we forgot what this country is founded upon, LIBERTY, JUSTICE, and at least some guarantee from the government that someone won't SENSELESSLY kill me just for their pleasure. To be secure in my person, and not have to fear for my life because some rich old man, with the funds and motive to do so, can indiscriminately kill me while I am enjoying the freedoms and liberties promised to me by The Declaration of the United States. I have a great reverence for what this country used to be, but I have lost faith and confidence in the willingness of the government to protect my life from being taken at the will of a madman, taking me from my WIFE, my SON, and my UNBORN CHILD. Neither should anyone have to lose the life of a loved one to such an act of senseless violence. As a veteran, not a combat veteran, but still, someone who dearly loves this country, and all of its citizens, I cannot sit idly by and watch my fellow Americans be killed, and not fell some emotion of hatred for the institution that allowed it to happen through the loose gun restriction of this country. Do not mistake my wish for gun control as a call for the revocation of any weapons deemed necessary for self-protection, but when the rich LITERALLY begin KILLING THE POOR for nothing more than their AMUSEMENT, in such a way that no amount of conceal carried handguns could have ever defended against, that is when the nation must join together in a show of solidarity, and come up with a real solution to this problem, not wait for a better time when the country isn‚Äôt mourning. Now is the time for us, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, to stand up for our inherent right to live. Our lives are more than just the plaything for the amusement of the rich and powerful; we have just as much of a reason to live, like them. Please do not discount my beliefs because of the forum I chose to give this message but didn‚Äôt the revolutionaries in every generation choose the easiest to reach medium for their messages? Why should this age be any different now because the medium has changed to social media? Also, PLEASE, before you discount my beliefs as nothing more than just the ramblings of some ranting liberal on the internet, hear me out and imagine that it was your wife, your husband, your son, your daughter, your mother, your father, or any other person that you hold dear to you, that they had been taken from you so viciously as the loved ones in Las Vegas were. The TIME for reforms to our gun laws is NOW, not tomorrow, not next month, NOW! We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity,  MUST SHOW THAT WE HAVE THE POWER TO MAKE OUR VOICES HEARD, HOWEVER, WHENEVER, AND THROUGH WHATEVER FORM WE MUST.

The vote is against the Constitution (from 1978, far newer than the American one for example) where it says the army and security forces have the right and responsibility to hold the country together. Also, Catalonia has been defendant from Spain forever. If it weren't, it would have been conquered and massacred completely centuries ago. Their culture has been respected well since the 12th century. Imagine some random people in Florida decide to become independent because they vote it out and it says works. Then they realize they have some nuclear missiles in Florida. How about we vote to launch them at New York? Why not we can vote for it right?\\n\\nP.S. This vote was completely irregular and unorganized. There is evidence of people voting more than four times and the people who are against the vote didn't vote because it is an illegal act. Resulting in a 90% vote for independence which is completely false. Do you even know what the consequences of independence would be?",0,0

j9UGpBZz7WU,"‚ÄúThis weekend I realised that some of my international Friends are confused by what‚Äôs happening in Spain with Catalonia. I hope this helps:\\n- Spain is a western democracy and its Catalan citizens vote frequently. In fact, between European, national, regional and municipal elections web have voted 6 times in the last five years.\\n- In the last regional election, pro-secession parties decided to unite around a single issue ‚Äìindependence- ant not only failed to win a majority of the vote, but also lost votes relative to the prior election. Polls, even those paid by the separatists, show support for independence is a minority and in decline.\\n- Catalonia is not ‚Äúoppressed‚Äù. It is one of the most prosperous regions in Spain and its citizens enjoy a high standard of living and one of the highest degrees of self-rule of any region in Europe.\\n- The party that traditionally ran the regional government of Catalonia has, for the last 30 years, used public money to promote a separatist agenda through education and local media and has illegally funded itself with a corrupt scheme where contractors had to pay bribes of at least 3% of any public work.\\n- The region of Catalonia has never existed as an independent political entity and was part or the Kingdom of Aragon, which merged dynastically with the Kingdom of Castille in 1492 to create the Spain we know today. There is no ‚Äúunion‚Äù, as in the UK. Catalonia is to Spain what Rousillon is to France or Cornwall to England.\\n- Spain is parliamentary democracy, with a constitution that can be amended. A vote on territorial secession would require such amendment and the support of a qualified majority of Spaniards.\\n- Not a single country or international organisation, with the exception of Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, has supported this movement.\\nSo why the fuss? As the economy improves and support for independence wanes, the separatists are afraid of ‚Äúmissing the train‚Äù and, breaking Spanish and regional laws, have embarked on a campaign to present the central government as ‚Äúevil‚Äù for not allowing a regional referendum which does not comply with the constitution (overwhelmingly approved throughout Spain, including Catalonia). This noise also conveniently masks regional corruption scandals and sets up separatists as victims for the next regional election.‚Äù",0,0

Breaking peace and solidarity.\\nYes I care and feel indignated that they are breaking the peace, they want to break the democracy, they are breaking the solidarity, they are breaking emotions. That is what the catalanistas are doing.\\nCatalan or catalanista is not the same.\\nCatalan by birth or adoption is a person who lives in Catalu√±a or other parts of the country, is someone who, pleased and proud to be from Catalu√±a, appreciates, respects and shares with the rest of the Spanish citizens. Catalan is someone who respects the democratic majority of Spain, is someone who knows that unity is strength.\\nCatalanist is someone who acts in a very different way to a Catalan. To begin with, Catalanists are a minority, in Catalu√±a and Spain. The catalanistas only look at their navel at the expense of everything and everyone else that is not them. Their flag inestead of star simbols should have money simbols. The money they do not want to share with the less favored parts of Spain. Catalanistas are a caste that considered itself superior and above the rest of Spanish people, millions of Catalans included. The origen of this cast is in the bourgeois class.\\nCatalans are the ones who sow contempt and hatred between Catalans and Spaniards. They are the ones that make a lot of noise, because they are a minority and need to pretend a reality bigger than themselves.\\nThe results that are now occurring are the basic cause and responsibility of the acts that the Catalanists are imposing amongst their families, their friends, their co-workers and the rest of the Spanish, bigger and more important wounds that can not be cured in hospitals or emergencies.\\nSpain is a democracy that at the beginning of its creation General Tejero tried to break up, he was also seconded by many Spaniards. Now the catalanistas want to do the sime. It was not allowed then, it canot be permited now. Polls can`t be done whenever minorities want it, because the majority have already voted to get the Spanish country we have.\\nIn the 21st century with a Europe eliminating important frontiers, Catalanists want to build the most painful border, this is a clear setback in the objectives of the Europe that most of us want and voted for.\\nThe reality is that we must respect the majority, specially when this majority also maintain objectives of peace, solidarity, unity, economic and emotional well-being.",0,0

Something smells fishy about the whole picture. Mr. Paddock was a wealthy peaceful man who couldn't care less about politics said his brother Eric Paddock. Stephen Paddock was a gambler but he did not loose his fortune or show any signs of mental illness. There is no evidence that he chronically abused Diazepam so to state he was psychotically influenced from the medications abuse is out of the question. Someone that night was playing with his girlfriends casino card trying to rack up points. This is still a mystery as to why. If paddock acted alone then who was the woman warning people of the shooting 45 minutes before it happened. How can a man like Stephen Paddock who did not fit the profile of a murderer at all kill at least 59 people? I think someone or others were involved. I do not know if this was mob related or something else entirely different but these answers must be addressed before a conclusion on an escape plan could be made.,0,0

He told me he was a bit scared since he had to age quite a bit over the course of the film and also do a South African accent which is quite tricky. I told him I knew he'd be great as all his work I'd seen is fantastic. He leaned over and kissed me and said, Fank you kind lady. Boom. I was Idrisized and melted into the ground.",17,4

I loved the first film because of the CGI and the way the shots were done to make the jaegers that much more big and impressive. This just seems more like a trailer for a new fast paced action video game. Another factor I liked about the first film is that the jaegers were slower which in turn created that humongous robot immersion, but I do get that the newer generation of jaegers are built to be quicker. As long as they can still capture the same immersion of the first film (and touch up the CGI), I am A-ok.",0,0

The hand over head bit can actually be quiet stressful because they dont know where your hand is going. When its under their chin it shows them what your doing...less stressfull for dogs.,0,0

The darker, more serious tone of the first one seemed more realistic. That, and the fact that the situation looked realistic and felt like it could happen made it amazing. They ended on a positive note that should have been the end of the story. \\n\\nBut of course... Hollywood does not know how to let things die.\\n\\nThis one looks more for sole purpose of a cash grab while keying in on an epic story. This sequel was not asked for, although if it is good, it will be appreciated. This looks like your every day action film where the big guy saves the world and gets the girl. The first one was not so different from that narrative, but it actually brought some new stuff to the table from old and classic ideas. This is basically a parody. If it is good, I will be thankful. If it is not, I will be incredibly disappointed.",0,0

fUjicxMPDzs,"This trailer is the worst. The music, the slow-mos, the cliche lines, the pumped up looks the actors give for the camera. Everything looks fake and hyped AF. It doesn't appear to have a story, just lots of CGI battles. It would be easily endurable if the actors didn't all look like they are in a kpop music video. Looks like this movie is going to ruin the first one for me just like a lot of the new movies that came out. I can't believe people were bashing Michael Bay for the Transformers.",0,0
fUjicxMPDzs,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer‚Äôs head. There‚Äôs also Rick‚Äôs nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they‚Äôre not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn‚Äôt appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick‚Äôs existential catchphrase ‚ÄúWubba Lubba Dub Dub,‚Äù which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev‚Äôs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I‚Äôm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon‚Äôs genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ\\n\\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It‚Äôs for the ladies‚Äô eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they‚Äôre within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid üòé",0,0

AzNIUMW_G8M,"Thinking of you at this difficult time. I recently lost my Dad to Lung & Bone Cancer. He was such an amazing man, so I can completely relate. He was my Best Friend and I never imagined that he wouldn't be here to walk me down Isle one day, or to see any children I have. He loved me more than anyone in this world loved me, so I do feel a void and my life has changed forever. A lot of people would say to me, you'll be ok, it will get easier - just stay strong. But the thing is in a way you feel like you can't grieve in the way that you need to, because you should be dealing with it. So my advise to you, is to focus on yourself, grieve in your own way, and don't let anyone tell you how to feel. We all grieve differently. I am very emotional, I burst in to tears all the time. I hold on to my Dad's legacy, the things he taught me, the things he did for me, I am an ambassador of his loving kindness. My life has changed so much now, I love myself so much more than I did, I don't worry about pointless things anymore and I live life to the fullest, because we all know it's short. Once again sending my sympathies your way. Know your Mum is watching down on you and always will. Remember the good times always. Sending lots of love your way! x",0,0

AzNIUMW_G8M,This is my first ever comment on a YT video.  It was really hard to watch.  I am an old lady in my fifties and I lost my amazing mum to breast cancer when I was in my early 30s.  You are absolutely right it is a shitty situation and will continue to be so for some time yet.  Grief is totally unpredictable and you will feel how you feel.  Don‚Äôt listen to anyone who says you ‚Äòshould‚Äô be doing a certain thing or ‚Äòshould‚Äô be feeling a certain way - this is your grief and it will be as it is.  Give yourself time and be kind to yourself.  Cry when you want to; rage when you need to and smile when you can. Talk to a professional if you find you have no one who can be objective. It won‚Äôt feel like it now but I promise it will get better.  The great emptiness doesn‚Äôt really go away - there are some days even now when I miss her more than I can say and feel jealous and resentful of those who still have access to their Mum - but I am so grateful that she was my Mum and the love she gave to me and that love and the memories of her are what I treasure most.  Her love is with you and always will be xx,0,0

AzNIUMW_G8M,"I am so sorry for your loss.  My heart breaks for you.  I lost my mother to breast cancer last November and lost my father to cancer six years ago.  I prayed after my mother passed away that no other family would ever have to lose a loved one to that horrible disease.  I gladly wanted to be the last human to lose a parent to cancer if I could spare anyone else the same pain.  Take all the time you need to grieve.  I can tell you that raw aching wound that you feel now will start to heal.  It will never go away, but it does become bearable.  It is a cliche for a reason, but time will help you heal.  There will be moments when a friend, loved one or family member will say just the right thing at the right moment that will make the pain go away for a fleeting second.  I hope you have many of those moments because they are what gets you through the initial grief.  The first year is the worst because there are so many first occasions to live through and mark.  You will feel like they will break you and you can't go on.  They will pass and you will gain strength and endure.  Cry when you need to, ask for hugs, spend time with your puppy.  The love of an animal can heal almost anything.  My cats helped me so much during those first awful weeks and months.  I want to let you know that you will get through this.  The raw pain you feel will ease.  You will get be able to think about your mother one day without wanting to cry.  I hope I can give you hope that it won't always be like this.  Take care and sending you a big hug.",0,0

Your action in delivering up the arms was dictated by your anti-national and criminal policy of abandoning the intrests of the nation.\\n\\nAnd now you try to make people believe that your miserable whining is fundamentally due to the fact that you have no arms. Just like everything else in your conduct, this is a lie and a falsification of the true reason.\\n\\nBut the politicians of the right deserve exactly the same reproach. It was through their miserable cowardice that those ruffians of Jews who came into power in 1918 were able to rob the nation of its arms. \\n\\nThe conservative politicians have neither right nor reason on their side when they appeal to disarmament as the cause which compelled them to adopt a policy of prudence (that is to say, cowardice).

A2cRZL70C0w,"What this demonstrates is that gay cultures is just as sexist as, well, straight culture. Imagine that. Point is, there is nothing wrong with it. It is called acknowledging the reality of sexuality and not demonizing it. Yet, if you are a straight man you'll know full well if you did that you'd be called a sexist. Turns out you were really just a lesbian in a man's body. They would say your objectifying woman. Man, lesbians your so objectifying of woman. OR you simply find them sexual and know they are not object but humans that you need to have what is called 'the sexy time'. Point is, it is NOT objectifying woman. It is acknowledging they are inherently sexual beings. Therefore, NO it is not sexual harassment, sexist, or objectifying when you act like that, whether a straight man, bisexual or a lesbian. So enjoy this gay woman. You deserve it. Next time you see a hot chick let her know it. Then Buzzfeed can have a video of a woman being 'harassed' by other woman.",0,0

fUjicxMPDzs,"some people are saying that they are advanced jaeger hence such quick movement and ninja-like reflex.. but i think  no matter how advanced they are, there is no logic behind their ninja-like movement speed. slower movement in the previous movie made us think that the jaegers are massive and it felt like real. now it looks like cartoon shit or power rangers movie.",0,0
fUjicxMPDzs,"HAHAHAHA I GET IT NOW,  at 0:22 you can see a kaijufied crimson typhoon, and at 0:46 you can see more of its model type, then at 0:53 again, you guys see that giant iconic shoulder pad right? and then at 1:36 and 1:38 is a reverse engineered gypsy danger with some more special upgrades (Made by the precursors of course). \\n\\nThere was this single question floating around, Why are the jaegers fighting each other?\\n First of all they are not,  all the so called jaeger v jaeger combat is with a enemy unit revamped by the precursors, and then of course they would want to make the movie seem really thrilling so they would make some intresting cuts to throw us off just like  civil war or any dc/marval movie, \\n\\nmy prediction is that, after gypsy exploded, the precursors imediatlly returned to the blast site to collect the remains of the jaeger, and after that they realize this type of form for their terra formers would be a really essantial asset so they would make a mass produced type of the jeagers, like the ones ar 0:22 and 0:53 ,then at 1:36 is the master jaeger , or atleast a completly modified gypsy danger that would allow the precursors to have a better understanding about what their oppoonent is doing to thwart them, and eventually succeed in creating a superior model to the old gypsy danger which would classify as a mark 7 or 6, which of course is what humanity is constructing at that very moment, and thats why the jeagers are somewhat evenly matched ( The Gypsy avenger v super gypsy danger) Oh and  plus at the end where it shows a lieutenant class kaiju 1:56 as stated by the scientist in the last movie,\\n\\n\\nOH and im not actually loking forward for this movie, it seems to cartoony though im still gonna watch it and acutally find out if im gonna like it or not",0,0

My mum died from breast cancer 2 years ago (I was 22) and I felt so much pressure to spring back and be okay straight away, but you never actually get over it and I'm still grieving now. Cancer is such a traumatic illness to deal with, it comes out of nowhere and takes people away piece by piece in the most awful way. I'm still traumatised now over how it stripped away everything my mum was. Just remember its okay not to be okay, the only good thing is you appreciate your own life a lot more after.",0,0
AzNIUMW_G8M,Im so sorry for your loss. I lost my uncle to cancer its horrible . Best wishes to you xx,0,0
AzNIUMW_G8M,"I see a lot of people commenting that they almost never comment, and the same goes for me. But I have watched and loved your videos for serveral years, so when seeing this video I felt that I wanted to reach out to you and tell you how truly sorry I am.\\n\\nI too recently lost my mother who had suffered from breast cancer and which had spread to her liver and back. It was almost the same process as your mother had to go trough but over a period of four years. Thinking that the breast cancer was treated and that we could finally go back to the life we used to have, only to be thrown back to the same painful and challenging situation again. \\n\\nCancer sucks, it really does. It's like you're living in this bubble for a long period of time, never knowing what to expect, how to live an everyday life when your life is so strongly affected by a this disease. \\n\\nWhen we found out that there was really only one way that my mothers illness could end, the only thing I could try and take some sort of comfort in was that there at least was time to say goodbye, to take care of each other and to just spend the last time together. It's really hard to see, because no one should have to live life knowing that the end is near. But now, when it has gone about two and a half months since she passed away I can slowly start to honestly appreciate that I had the time to say goodbye.\\n\\nMy mother was my best friend, really. We could talk about anything, we spent whole days just talking about all and nothing. She, just like your mum, told me all the time how proud she was of me and my sister. She always took the time to try her best to be there for not only her daugthers, but so many other people in her life, in an unselfish way I have never seen before and probably never will again. I can only hope to be something like her in my life, because she has been and always will be my biggest inspiration and role model. \\n\\nLosing ones parents is so unfair, even as an adult or young adult. I don't need my mum in the same way I needed her when I was 10. But as a 23 year old, starting to build the adult life I want, I would have loved to have her there by my side. For her to give me advice when needed and just keep being my very best friend. And to love me, which se did and told me a hundred times every day. \\n\\nBut knowing that she loved me, and that she rasied me to be a person I can say I'm proud of being is such a gift, and something I am trying everyday to see even though it's so unfair that I don't get to see her again. I also know that she is with me, in some way, forever. I think, or even know that you will feel this way, maybe not now but in time. It's only been two months since I lost my mum and I'm allready starting to feel it in my heart.\\n\\nBut of course this shitty situation gives me days when I really can't take comfort in any of this or anything at all. And that is okay, almost every way of greiving is okay. As long as you remember to take care of yourself and to let it take its time and its ups and downs. Let yourself feel what you feel, always. Do what you want to, and don't do what you don't want to do. \\n\\nDon't feel shame if you feel happy and optimistic about the future. Even though you most of all want to have your mum back, the unfair and harsh truth is that there was only one way it could end. And having to live in that bubble of sadness and fear for so long can make you feel as if your life has been on hold and not moving in any way. That is of course natural, and maybe how you want it to be and need it to be. But quite soon after her passning I felt a sense of freedom and that I could see my life moving forward.\\n\\nI felt so ashamed at first, because how could I feel optimistic about the future when my mum just died? But having courage and opening up about this feeling of freedom to my friends and family made me realise that it is okay. They told me it is okay, and quite natural. \\n\\nHaving to adjust to a disease that there is actually no way of adjusting to, since you never know what turn it has decided to take that day. Having to wake up every morning with the fear of that this day could be the last. To seeing your amazing and beloved parent suffer every day for so long, is paralyzing. You neither can or want to look forward because there is no room for planning a head, and because the last thing you want to think about the future which is what you now means the end. I now see where this feeling of freedom comes from. You put your life on hold because you want to. But once you can pick it up and returning to move forward without fear (which is how it should be), you will feel free and optimistic. And I know, and maybe you feel the same, that my mum wants me too make the best of myself and to work towards the life I want. Even if she can't be with me to see it. We are the most the most important people to our parents and they are proud knowing that we will and want to make the best of ourselves, of our lives. They find peace knowing that we will take care of ourselves and find happiness, even after they are gone. My mum told me this so many times and I have no doubt that she meant it every time. And the moments the worried about how it all would turn out for me and my sister, I assured her that we would be allright. It won't be easy cooping with the loss and sadness, but in the end we will okay. And I plan on keeping my promise to her. \\n\\nThis was probably the longest comment in the history of youtube. There is so much more I could say about this, because it is so complex. I know that everyones journey through loss of a parent is different and so it should be. But I still wanted to share my experience of loss and greif to you and anyone else who is going trough the same thing. Hopefully it can bring some sort of comfort to someone who needs it. \\n\\nI once again want to tell you how very sorry I am for your loss. It is awful and painful and unfair. I send my thoughts to you and your family. Take the time you need, find strenght in that your mum will be there always in some way and take care of yourself. Let this process take it's turns. It can go up and down, back and forward. You don't have to finish greiving, because i think it never feel completely fine, but it will be easier to manage in time, or at least at times.\\n\\nYour loyal and loving subscribers will be here when and if you decide to come back to youtube, myself included. You and your videos have brought me so much joy when life hasn't gone my way, and I'm sure I'm not alone on that one. \\n\\nLove and lots of hugs from Sweden ‚ù§Ô∏è",0,0

hw1RrmlrTtM,"There are 30,000 gun-related deaths per year by firearms, and this number is not disputed. U.S. population is approximately 328 million. Do the math: 0.00925% of the population dies from gun related actions each year. Statistically speaking, this is insignificant! What is never told, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths, to put them in perspective as compared to other causes of death: - 65% of those deaths are by suicide which would never be prevented by gun laws - 15% are by law enforcement in the line of duty and justified - 17% are through criminal activity, gang and drug related or mentally ill persons ‚Äì gun violence - 3% are accidental discharge deaths So technically, ‚Äúgun violence‚Äù is not 30,000 annually, but drops to 5,100. \\n\\nStill too many? Well, first, how are those deaths spanned across the nation? - 480 homicides (9.4%) were in Chicago - 344 homicides (6.7%) were in Baltimore - 333 homicides (6.5%) were in Detroit - 119 homicides (2.3%) were in Washington D.C. (a 54% increase over prior years) So basically, 25% of all gun crime happens in just 4 cities. All 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause. \\n\\nThis basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state. That is an average because some States have much higher rates than others. For example, California had 1,169 and Alabama had 1. Now, who has the strictest gun laws by far? California, of course, but understand, it is not guns causing this. It is a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal persons residing in those cities and states. \\n\\nSo if all cities and states are not created equally, then there must be something other than the tool causing the gun deaths. Are 5,100 deaths per year horrific? How about in comparison to other deaths? All death is sad and especially so when it is in the commission of a crime, but that is the nature of crime. Robbery, death, rape, assault, are carried out by criminals, and thinking that criminals will obey laws is ludicrous. That‚Äôs why they are criminals. \\n\\nBut what about other deaths each year?\\n - 40,000+ die from a drug overdose ‚Äì THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT!\\n - 36,000 people die per year from the flu, far exceeding the criminal gun deaths \\n- 34,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities (exceeding gun deaths, even if you include suicide)\\n Now it gets good: - 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!\\n - 710,000 people die per year from heart disease. It‚Äôs time to stop the double cheeseburgers! \\n\\nSo what is the point? If congress and the anti-gun movement focused their attention on heart disease, then even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths, or 4 times the number of criminal homicides‚Ä¶. Simple, easily preventable 10% reductions! \\n\\nSo you have to ask yourself, in the grand scheme of things, why is the focus on guns? It‚Äôs pretty simple: Taking away guns gives control to governments. The founders of this nation knew that regardless of the form of government, those in power may become corrupt and seek to rule as the British did by trying to disarm the populace of the colonies. It is not difficult to understand that a disarmed populace is a controlled populace. Thus, the second amendment was proudly and boldly included in the U.S. Constitution. It must be preserved at all costs. So the next time someone tries to tell you that gun control is about saving lives, look at these facts and remember these words from Noah Webster: ‚ÄúBefore a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword, because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force at the command of Congress can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power.‚Äù Remember, when it comes to ‚Äúgun control,‚Äù the important word is ‚Äúcontrol,‚Äù not ‚Äúgun.‚Äù \\n\\n** SOURCE: FBI.gov, on gun stats. Numerous sources on the other things such as cardiac arrest, etc. are easy Google searches. Then simply do the math in percentages.",0,0

There were some great warriors from Lesbos (men) and they even fought in the battle of Thermopylae...which has incorrectly been called the 300 but indeed there were more than one thousands joining together to hold the pass. All peoples from Lesbos were called Lesbians. There was a beautiful woman (630-570) and she wrote poems and stories. She grew in status because of her brothers victories in war. Using her status she was able to spread her writing and became well known. Her name was Sappho. She was also a homosexual that frequently had relationships with women. That was quite common back then just as it was a status symbol for a man (even married) to take on a young male lover for himself. Just the same as Leonardo di ser Piero was from the city of Vinci and we call him Leonardo da Vinci, we call her Sappho the Lesbian. That is where the term Lesbian comes from. Hope you enjoyed this story from ancient history. Learn more about Sappho and her famous poetry - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sappho",0,0

Few years later, an abusive relationship later I realised something. People come into our lives to teach us something, the emptiness They leave behind shows not only how much we cared about Them, but also how much love and positivity They blessed us with. I realise it's hard, some days may be more difficult than others, I know it may not be today, next week or next month, but one day please smile to Yourself, thanking those People for all the kindness They taught You, the sunny days They brought  You, the love They taught You to feel.

It has really cheesy jaegers unlike the old ones which were more junky, which is what I really liked about the old one, not this cheesy new super advanced machines which just look straight out of the future. Like I see what they did with the new Gipsy Danger having a blade on its right arm like Gypsy danger had the sword, but I honestly prefer the less scifi more realistic jaegers.

Grieving will last a lifetime. It changes but it will always be there, just take each  day at a time, each hour at a time. In a few months when you are ready please talk to a bereavement counsellor. The loss's you have experienced this year are literally life changing and you won't be the same again. This isn't all negative although it feels that way, sounds a strange thing to say and what I mean is since losing my Dad at 28 Four years ago it has shaped me into who I am today - I see life as it is - precious and short. I honour his memory by living and doing everything I can and want to do. Take care and take time. Don't feel guilty for the days you laugh or the days you can't get out of bed for crying. Xx",0,0

jsR0dclw060,"Hi Studio C!!! Love all your videos! I had sort of an idea for a sketch- one video that always makes me laugh is the Mona Lisa one. I was thinking you could turn that into a series, like the story behind various paintings. I thought of American Gothic (that pitchfork one) and had an idea that maybe the original pose was something much nicer, and that the two kept arguing with each other and fighting, to the point when the man pulls a pitchfork on the woman, and at the moment they're about to attack each other, the painter yells something, and they turn around. Snapshot. \\nIdk guys it's just an idea, but I could totally see it happening, with maybe Adam and Whitney as the characters and Matt as a tour guide in an art museum telling a much nicer story about its background. What do you guys think?",0,0
jsR0dclw060,"I love this mostly because Jeremy is just the simple mustache man, not with any secrets, just plain old (amazing) Jeremy.

We must speak truth but in doing that let's show President Trump that we have a high standard for his Job title . We can't show him this by disrespecting him because he is still currently the leader of our Country ,Commander in Chief. We have to remember that our children's children will see what this generation of people in these times did and say just like we look at times before us. Let's start a movement of change  that represents who we want to be in this country and what we want our country to look like .

2K57-24FnIM,"We can I'm sure lie to ourselves in all these ways and it's good to be reminded. Tho when I respond in such forms as these, I am not /necessarily/ lying to myself in all instances. E.g. sometimes some people behave arrogantly and do try to tell us how we should do the things at which we are expert. And in these cases we should first pause to consider what is really going on, and then, if this is not a probable case of lying to oneself, perhaps we /should/ call them out about it. Defensive Woman /might/ be lying to herself about her musical decisions and insecurity over them... or she /might/ be hearing for the umteenth time this month someone telling her how to suck eggs (e.g. the dreaded 'mansplaining') in which case her response seems relatively reasonable. If the latter, the last thing I want her to think is that it is wholly down to her being insecure - society seems already to do a good job of impressing that on her in such circumstances. [Or I am defending her simply because I'm insecure...?! ;-) ]. Let's not either encourage ourselves to fall for society's apparent fallacy that no-one on this earth could possibly be happy/happier as a singleton, as Denial Man claims for himself (e.g. movies /can/ for many still be good on your own...). The tricky bit seems to be to tell when a potential lie is really a lie in oneself or others (especially in the moment)...topic for next video?",0,0

2K57-24FnIM,"I really like The school of life, but many times when I finish watching videos that discuss themes about the relation of oneself to life's issues, I get quite depressed. I'll explain why. Through the school of life I learned a lot about myself, my feelings, encouraging lessons about not being ashamed of my vulnerability, and various other issues involving relationships, life challenges, and life itself. But what makes me depressed is knowing people's hypocrisy, their ignorance, even though they all share the same feelings. The world is indifferent. Although the school of life teaches us in a didactic and comforting way how to accept ourselves, and accept our reality, and the reality of how people and the world are, and how we deal with them in order to obtain a satisfying life to the fullest, we know that this does not happen. we live in an ignorant world. We are faced with reality and to get ourselves into the world we have to mold ourselves, hide our feelings, follow patterns and behaviors, deal with judgments, wear masks, prove injustice and do injustice. We can not learn to be emotionally intelligent, we have to learn by observing suffering and experiencing suffering, ultimately by living. Not reading a book or watching videos on YouTube, this is not a criticism of the school of life. As I said, I really like The school of life. But I believe that the reality is very obscure and indifferent to the solutions proposed here.",0,0

2K57-24FnIM,"Guys... have you noticed how wicked and dire the world is becoming as of late?\\n\\nTake a moment and consider the state of our world:\\n\\n-The global economy is out of control.\\n\\n\\n-The Middle East is at the tipping point.\\n\\n\\n-The world hates Israel.\\n\\n\\n-There is a growing demand for a one world economic, political, and religious system.\\n\\n\\n-There are wars and rumors of war (especially in regards to World War 3).\\n\\n\\n-Racism is some of the worst it's ever been.\\n\\n\\n-Hatred and madness is spilling over into riots in the streets.\\n\\n\\n-Perversion is running rampant.\\n\\n\\n-The weather is out of control.\\n\\n\\n-We're mutilating unborn children and mistakenly believing we have a right to do so.\\n\\n\\n-Education is in the toilet.\\n\\n\\n-Earthquakes and volcanic eruptions are happening in more and more diverse places at a highly alarming rate.\\n\\n... You getting the picture? Something is deeply wrong with our world.\\n\\nNone of what you see going on in the world is normal or good. In fact, much of what you see happening around the globe coincides with Bible Prophecy. The Bible says many of these things would occur before Christ returns. You can investigate it for yourself. The Bible says in the last days there will be: wars and rumors of war; a one world economic/governmental/religious system; Kingdoms against kingdoms and the seas and people raging; Violence and perversion on a grand scale; Earthquakes in diverse places, etc.\\n\\n... Sounds *exactly* like our world today, doesn't it? If that weren't enough to chew on, consider this: The Books of John and Acts combined total up to over 120+ historically verified facts. When you consider that, it gets a little difficult to write the Bible off as fairy tales when history and archaeology are on its side...\\n\\n*Are you paying attention yet?* God is *screaming* at us! He warned us thousands of years in advance that all of what you are seeing would happen- and it is! It's all coming together to the letter! In fact, if you doubt the validity of Bible Prophecy, I encourage you to consider this: the Bible warns that in the last days that Damascus will become a ruinous heap. It will become a no man's land inhabited by no one. Use that as a litmus test of sorts. Keep an eye on Damascus. If it never falls then feel free to throw out the Bible. But when Damascus does fall in the not too distant future... You'll see God is no liar. God also declares that the only way to heaven is to accept Jesus as your Savior. Good deeds won't get you there nor do good deeds erase a bad deed. If you murder somebody, that person is still dead even if you do nothing but good deeds after murdering them. You need a Savior who will forgive you of that murder because you can't save yourself.\\n\\nYet, many people will still discount God and His goodness even when shown evidence that the Bible is valid and coming true. A lot of people have difficulty believing in God because of all the evils in the world. However, this discounting of the only Person who can save you may be less of an inborn frustration or complaint and more of a hidden longing, placed there by the very One who planted His own image into the body and soul of every person He created. Where does this deep-seated intuition that suffering and pain are not right come from if we're just amalgamations of atoms, as the atheists say‚Ä¶?\\n\\nWhat if, perhaps, this intuition points to something deeper? Something built into ourselves that reflects our true nature and identity? What if this revulsion against suffering and pain is a reminder of paradise, on one hand, and an anticipation of New Jerusalem on the other?\\n\\nPerhaps it's the cry of the human spirit for God. For our Creator. The only One who can, and will, fix this mess.\\n\\nAs I've said, time is short. Bible Prophecy is happening at a frightening pace. You could argue, You're just being paranoid like all the other fundamentalists. Haven't we always had these types of problems? Sure... But never at this magnitude or frequency! Check the news for yourselves. The amount of earthquakes, bloodshed, madness and horrific weather events are off the charts! Don't be deceived into thinking it's not as bad as it seems out there. The devil wants you to stay anemic and apathetic. Don't let that jerk deceive you. Or win your soul. Satan wants nothing more than for you to roll your eyes, scoff under your breath and put this whole God business under the rug. He wants you to continue believing that Hell and God and the afterlife is nonsense. That the Bible is all fairy tale nonsense of Jesus riding dinosaurs; that it's stuff only the weak-minded, brainwashed people believe. He'll gladly coax your pride, making you believe you're far too reasoned to believe in such things. However, Satan believes the Bible. Every jot and word of it. He doesn't see it as fairy-tale nonsense since it details his coming destruction. He just doesn't want YOU to believe it so he can drag your soul down with him when it's time for him to go!\\n\\nDon't let him drag you down into the grave with him. Don't be played! Hell is a very real place-- a place of eternal separation, loneliness, and despair. No friends, no family... just you. A-L-O-N-E. In the dark. Miserable for all eternity. If hell wasn't real, what on earth was Jesus willing to die for to protect us from...? Bill Nye thinks hell won't be so bad; he claims he's willing to hold onto his darwinian beliefs even if it means he's hellbound for it. I hope you won't share in that kind of disillusioned thinking...\\n\\nBefore you're sent to hell, you'll appear at the Great White Throne Judgment. Whether you believe in hell or not makes no difference--that giant throne you want to avoid seeing at all costs will be your destiny if Christ isn't your Savior. At the Great White Throne Judgment the books are thrown wide open and the past is recalled. Details and sins long forgotten or covered up are brought to light. Plenty of people will have a list of good deeds: acts of charity, love, and sacrifice. All their good deeds will be carefully considered... but none of them will be good enough to gain them admittance into heaven. The good deeds they did will have an impact on where they end up in the lake of fire, however. Hell will not be the same for everyone, but it will still be eternal misery... misery you could have easily avoided.\\n\\nSinners will wish they had done just a little less evil so their punishment could be a little more tolerable. Pornographers will wish they hadn't made so many videos. Control freaks will wish they hadn't been so angry and abusive. The internet troll will wish he hadn't cursed and slung so many demeaning insults toward a stranger online. And the abortionist will wish they hadn't killed any pre-born infants. All sins will be exposed. There's no way out... unless...\\n\\nUnless you accept Christ as your Savior. Confess that you're a sinner, repent of your sins and accept His free gift of salvation and grace. It's all yours... free for the taking! Jesus is the only way to get out of what's coming soon upon this world. I know you've probably heard Jesus loves you a million times in your life, and it probably sounds like an empty mantra by now... but it really is the truth! Do you know why you exist? Have you ever stopped and pondered about that...? Nothing in this life comes to be without God's approval first. That means that God thought¬† you were so worth the effort that He created you!\\n\\nOr maybe you're wondering, How do I know that only Jesus can save me? What about Islam? Or what about Hinduism or Buddhism? How do I know that the Bible isn't a book of fiction and myths? In fact, what about all the starving kids in Africa? If God is so just and loving, explain that one! These are incredibly valid questions that deserve real answers. In fact, how can you even know God is real to begin with?\\n\\nIf you have deep questions related to God, or if you're just remotely curious about Him... I encourage you to search out these authors. I'll even list some of their books that address just about any issue or question you could have about God:\\n\\nFrank Turek- Stealing From God: Why Atheists Need God to Make Their Case\\n\\nAndreas Kostenberger- Truth Matters\\n\\nLouis Markos- Apologetics for the 21st Century\\n\\nNorman L. Geisler- When Skeptics Ask, I Don't Have Enough Faith To Be An Atheist\\n\\nC.S. Lewis- Mere Christianity\\n\\nLee Strobel- The Case For Christ, The Case For A Creator, The Case For Grace\\n\\nRavi Zacharias- The End of Reason, Jesus Among Other Gods, Can Man Live Without God? Why Suffering?\\n\\nPhilip Yancey- Reaching For The Invisible God, Disappointment With God\\n\\nAlso, the One Minute Apologist right here on YouTube offers quick videos that tackle tough questions about God.\\n\\n**\\n\\nWhy am I telling you all this? Especially when this has absolutely nothing to do with the video you're watching? Simple: to warn you. To offer you a life line. Deep down, if you have discernment and common sense, you can tell something is dreadfully wrong with this world and something in your heart is telling you to get right with God before it's too late. Don't ignore that voice! Listen to it, no matter how small it is. I'm just a beggar telling other beggars where they can go to find the Bread of Life.\\n\\nDon't let anything stop you from finding God. To quote Erwin Lutzer: Standing at the Great White Throne Judgment will be hordes from every country of the world, from every religion in the world, with the best intentions in the world. They will learn too late that God is serious about justice, and if Christ does not bear their punishment, they must bear their own.\\n\\nDon't lose your life! Let Christ save you while there's still time.",0,0

bB01zORIGkA,would a Ts4000 work from pictures i've seen it does not have the knob on the back but does have the instant on off trigger,0,0
bB01zORIGkA,"i teared when i saw the awesomeness. it was so frikin beautiful ...\\n\\nadditional note: even if the soda bottle has a sharp tip to cut through the air as it travels, or maybe some wings, it won't stay accurate for long because of pressure regression that occurs once the air inside it cools after firing. Because of this effect the bottle will actually suck the cold atmospheric air from the same hole the flammable gasses were ignited and propelled thus making it flip over itself and/or slow down before it hits its main target at a certain distance.\\n\\nso... please make a bottle flip video for this! :D",0,0
bB01zORIGkA,A cool idea would be to make special rockets that could to different things like explode or like that could just fly really far,0,0

bB01zORIGkA,"Missed watching your videos man, love your content.",0,0
bB01zORIGkA,That is so smart!,0,0
bB01zORIGkA,"A better method to make the vents on the launching pipe would be to use a router base on a Dremel and build a jig to hold the pipe. Have a retractable indexing pin so the pipe can be put in the jig for making the first cut, then pushed in to index rotation in the first cut and subsequent cuts. Several shallow cuts, all the same length, would result in more consistent launches, especially if a pit of PVC was glued on for a depth stop for the bottles.",0,0
bB01zORIGkA,Would be great if you designed some actual projectile for this weapon.,0,0
bB01zORIGkA,props on the ingenuity of the pvc grinding to allow the gas to flow.  As you were describing the issue I got excited about the challenge.  Genius is in the simple but effective solutions!,0,0

bB01zORIGkA,"Hi Ben, great project! Regarding safety equipment, actions speak much louder than words. Encouraging your viewers to use eye and ear protection isn't nearly as effective when all your demonstrations show you failing to use any eye or (obvious) ear protection.

bB01zORIGkA,NOT plasma so he is a lier?,0,1
bB01zORIGkA,Building this! Most likely will add some fins and nose cone to the bottle,0,1
bB01zORIGkA,you should try putting rubing alcohol in the bottle to continue burning in flight and shooting like a rocket. would probably be smart to make a sheild as well so you dont get burnt,0,1

bB01zORIGkA,how far does it fly?,0,1
bB01zORIGkA,Very cool project. If I may suggest for a future video could you work on a power generator Faraday style. Just copper and magnets. Primitive designs like that are very inspiring as the technology of today is proof of that.,0,1
bB01zORIGkA,"This was the first of your videos I watched, I watched the whole thing. Very impressed with the level of detail, I feel like I could answer anyone's questions about this if I were to build it. Do a collaborative with Grant Thompson from king of random!

bB01zORIGkA,(15:47) You can add some wings on the bottle for the projectile stability,0,1
bB01zORIGkA,That‚Äôs awesome! Love the look of the flame coming out!,0,1
bB01zORIGkA,How about shrink the bottle down so it has a leaner profile and see if it will fly farther.,0,1
bB01zORIGkA,Did you try charging the bottle with gas while the neck is on the cutouts then moving it forward past the cutouts before igniting the gas?,0,1

bB01zORIGkA,Bird,0,1
bB01zORIGkA,This looks very steampunk-y. I love it.,0,1
bB01zORIGkA,You could try using a Tesla Valve as it relies on geometry rather than a physical stopper to block back flow for future designs,0,1
bB01zORIGkA,I really like this project and I want to try it with my nephew he really likes science and projects like this my question is instead of grinding down the edge of the tube in order to let air in would it not be simpler to just punch a small hole somewhere close to the neck of the bottle to let air in that way you can still have plenty of pressure,0,1
bB01zORIGkA,Aaaaand we never saw how far it goes,0,1

bB01zORIGkA,"@NightHawkInLight That isn't actually plasma, right?",0,1
bB01zORIGkA,"could this be done with MAPP gas, or would the hotter fuel cause a safety issue?",0,1
bB01zORIGkA,ahahahaha plasma coil. i know fire is plasma... but seriously....? hahahaha,0,1
bB01zORIGkA,Do you think it would be safe to use MAP gas? Also where can I get the info on how to calculate PSI generated by combustion of gas x with atmospheric O2 levels? Sounds like that would be interesting reading! Thanks for another great vid!,0,1
bB01zORIGkA,Would some fins and a weighted cone improve the flight of the bottles? Awesome video and will be definitely be trying this one! Many thanks.,0,1
bB01zORIGkA,Very interesting! Would love to see a possible conversion or alteration or possibly even a new project to change the color of the Flame,0,1
bB01zORIGkA,This video was Awesome! We watched this in school.,0,1
bB01zORIGkA,Jajajaja he is like Graves from League of Legends xdxd,0,1
bB01zORIGkA,"Reminds me of the fart cannon we built as kids. Take several soup cans leaving the end on the first can and remove both the top and the bottom from the others. Tape together with duct tape making a tube. Next use a drill or a pop top can opener to make a small whole in the side of the fist can near the base. Place a tennis ball in te open end. Next add lighter fluid through the small hole you made in the first can then cover the hole with your finger. Then while holding the tube (may want a second person to help0 use a lighter to light the lighter fluid at the hole, you could also build a BBQ spark ignitor into the bottom can. The fluid will ignite and shoot the tennis ball out of the end with a barroush sound similar to a loud fart. Be careful, lots of fun.",0,1

bB01zORIGkA,"As badass as that coil looks, I think I'd still want to put a metal shroud over the side nearest my face, in case you accidentally let too much gas in and the whole thing blows apart.",0,0
bB01zORIGkA,"It is extremely visually appealing to watch the gentle, blue flame. You should make a project (or many) where you focus on getting extra good slow motion captures of the burning inside the tube. Possibly experiment with various different flames in order to get different colours. The charcoal powder was very nice and soft blue is really relaxing. If you are able to get a good enough high speed camera (I don't know how good your current one is) then it might even be a type of digital art you could sell online. I know that I for one would love to have it as my computer background.\\nKeep up the good work",1,2
bB01zORIGkA,What kind of bird is Mose?,0,3
bB01zORIGkA,"I want to try this with a longer length of tubing using compressed gases. The tricky part is getting the mixture right so the flame moves slowly, instead of sending wood and plastic shrapnel everywhere.",0,3

The NAACP image awards are a waste. ¬†Either you segregate yourself which is what BET does and promotes, or you integrate. ¬†Realize that just because you're famous and black it doesn't mean your views are better or that you are always right. ¬†I will pray that no matter how much money eminem or marshall or whatever he wants to be called that he realizes the truth, he is a puppet for BET just to say they don't dislike ALL white people. By the way quick fact that BET might not be able to handle the NAACP was founded by, ready? ¬†A WHITE MAN!! ¬†So all of that ass-kissing and under the table playing at the image awards still is because of a white man, that had to hurt, just say thank you to his family and go on making that money.",0,0

2K57-24FnIM,"We can I'm sure lie to ourselves in all these ways and it's good to be reminded. Tho when I respond in such forms as these, I am not /necessarily/ lying to myself in all instances. E.g. sometimes some people behave arrogantly and do try to tell us how we should do the things at which we are expert. And in these cases we should first pause to consider what is really going on, and then, if this is not a probable case of lying to oneself, perhaps we /should/ call them out about it. Defensive Woman /might/ be lying to herself about her musical decisions and insecurity over them... or she /might/ be hearing for the umteenth time this month someone telling her how to suck eggs (e.g. the dreaded 'mansplaining') in which case her response seems relatively reasonable. If the latter, the last thing I want her to think is that it is wholly down to her being insecure - society seems already to do a good job of impressing that on her in such circumstances. [Or I am defending her simply because I'm insecure...?! ;-) ]. Let's not either encourage ourselves to fall for society's apparent fallacy that no-one on this earth could possibly be happy/happier as a singleton, as Denial Man claims for himself (e.g. movies /can/ for many still be good on your own...).

2K57-24FnIM,"I really like The school of life, but many times when I finish watching videos that discuss themes about the relation of oneself to life's issues, I get quite depressed. I'll explain why. Through the school of life I learned a lot about myself, my feelings, encouraging lessons about not being ashamed of my vulnerability, and various other issues involving relationships, life challenges, and life itself. But what makes me depressed is knowing people's hypocrisy, their ignorance, even though they all share the same feelings. The world is indifferent. Although the school of life teaches us in a didactic and comforting way how to accept ourselves, and accept our reality, and the reality of how people and the world are, and how we deal with them in order to obtain a satisfying life to the fullest, we know that this does not happen. we live in an ignorant world. We are faced with reality and to get ourselves into the world we have to mold ourselves, hide our feelings, follow patterns and behaviors, deal with judgments, wear masks, prove injustice and do injustice. We can not learn to be emotionally intelligent, we have to learn by observing suffering and experiencing suffering, ultimately by living. Not reading a book or watching videos on YouTube, this is not a criticism of the school of life. As I said, I really like The school of life. But I believe that the reality is very obscure and indifferent to the solutions proposed here.",0,0

Because of this effect the bottle will actually suck the cold atmospheric air from the same hole the flammable gasses were ignited and propelled thus making it flip over itself and/or slow down before it hits its main target at a certain distance.\\n\\nso... please make a bottle flip video for this! :D",0,0

bB01zORIGkA,How about shrink the bottle down so it has a leaner profile and see if it will fly farther.,0,0
bB01zORIGkA,Did you try charging the bottle with gas while the neck is on the cutouts then moving it forward past the cutouts before igniting the gas?,0,0
bB01zORIGkA,You could try using a Tesla Valve as it relies on geometry rather than a physical stopper to block back flow for future designs,0,0
bB01zORIGkA,I really like this project and I want to try it with my nephew he really likes science and projects like this my question is instead of grinding down the edge of the tube in order to let air in would it not be simpler to just punch a small hole somewhere close to the neck of the bottle to let air in that way you can still have plenty of pressure,0,0

bB01zORIGkA,"Reminds me of the fart cannon we built as kids. Take several soup cans leaving the end on the first can and remove both the top and the bottom from the others. Tape together with duct tape making a tube. Next use a drill or a pop top can opener to make a small whole in the side of the fist can near the base. Place a tennis ball in te open end. Next add lighter fluid through the small hole you made in the first can then cover the hole with your finger. Then while holding the tube (may want a second person to help0 use a lighter to light the lighter fluid at the hole, you could also build a BBQ spark ignitor into the bottom can. The fluid will ignite and shoot the tennis ball out of the end with a barroush sound similar to a loud fart. Be careful, lots of fun.",0,0

bB01zORIGkA,"It is extremely visually appealing to watch the gentle, blue flame. You should make a project (or many) where you focus on getting extra good slow motion captures of the burning inside the tube. Possibly experiment with various different flames in order to get different colours. The charcoal powder was very nice and soft blue is really relaxing. If you are able to get a good enough high speed camera (I don't know how good your current one is) then it might even be a type of digital art you could sell online.

j0AoUB9Nqtw,"they both respect each other as fighters theyre only there to promote the event and all the other bullshit that goes along with it before a fight so they may as well have some fun with it. whatever happens happens, 1 punch can change everything so speculate all u want they are both professionals... something we should all agree on after watching this is that bisping is  one funny motherfucker! gsp understands the english language fine he just burned every time he opened his mouth lol. what a character bisping is. its only a few harmless words to stir the pot who cares. mcgregor is prime example of a shit talking show pony, bisping along with dana and georges are calm they dont care. im generally cocky in day to day life but leading up to a scrap where both men are pro will only make u look like a dickhead if u lose and it only takes 1 clean hit",0,0

Partly due to the Las Vegas shooting, but mostly because of the Colorado shooting in 2012. You could not have been ignoring that when you made the joke so it kind of feels like a parody of that event. Especially with the framing of a Batman sketch and the Colorado shooting being at the midnight release of the Dark Night Rises. I know this was finished before the Las Vegas shooting but still. I left this review thinking about shootings when I came here for comedy. 20 years ago that joke would have been funny, but now that its a real possibility it just feels gross. I'm disappointed.",0,0

I don't really care for the photoshop cartoons, but they've become such a staple of the NC, I tolerate them well enough. This was a Big Screen event. Up the ante a little, guys! They totally could've brought Andrew Kaiko on again to animate the Joker, and maybe even hired a guest voice actor like Xander Mobus to do an impression of the Joker. They have the money to outsource, don't they?

2K57-24FnIM,"1. My mother loves to talk about her prison days in Mecca! \\n\\nI am so sorry that she ended up in jail back then, but frankly, it was all her fault. But there is something very charming and interesting about the way she denies it. Of course, the lies we tell ourselves are always more beautiful than the reality they replace.\\nSo my mother doesn't obey any rules she herself hadn't set. That's why on that journey she didn't care that her visa was expired. She wanted to stay longer , so she did. One day she got assaulted by two thieves.\\n\\n Then the police came and the thieves accused my mother of being the thief! She doesn't speak Arabic, so she couldn't defend herself.\\nShe didn't even had her passport with her so they took her to jail. Imagine to be locked up in a foreign country where you don't know anybody! Besides, she had no idea how long she was going to stay there. \\n\\nBut she was convinced that it was all organised by God, for her to have the experience, to meet the people there, to suffer, to endure and to prove her faith to Him no matter what disasters life brings. \\nSome days  later a man from the Turkish embassy visited her in prison. She explained to him that she was innocent.  And  when he asked him how she was doing she said: \\n\\n I am very fine. I am observing the people here.\\n\\nTwo weeks later she got out, escorted by the police to the airport and sent back home to Turkey. \\nImagine how humiliating all this can be, for a woman in her sixties.. But she went through all that like the hero of a drama extra written for her by God. \\n\\nUnfortunately I am not a believer, but I do envy all the possibilities of consolation, that the believers have.  My mother will never have to ask: \\n\\n Why me ?. \\n\\nInstead she will  firmly say: \\n\\n Precisely me , because God wanted it for me. \\n\\nOh and in my case, I could only say:  Why NOT me ? Anything can happen to me  anytime....And as Seneca says: A ship may also sink at the port.... \\n\\nWell, indeed, if it doesn't hurt anybody, sometimes, it may be alright to avoid the truth. I would never recommend my mother my approach.  If a person successfully deludes herself, and you have nothing better to offer her instead, you may also let that be. Of course on this channel there is a great lesson on this subject  too: \\n\\n Can lying ever be kind\\n\\n In some strange cases like my mother's, this may even apply to the lies we tell ourselves...\\n\\n2. And here is the joke I love the most on this subject: \\n\\n So there is this guy who suspects that his wife cheats on him. He hires a private detective to find out what's going on. After one week of a business trip he comes back and asks to the detective: \\n- So what have you seen?\\n- Sir, the first day when you were gone, your wife met this very handsome young man. And then they went to a fancy restaurant. After that they went to see a movie. After the movie, late at night, they went to your place , right  to your bedroom. Then they hugged each other. \\n- And then ??\\n- Then they closed the curtains. \\n So the husband says:\\n-  God damn it! You pay a fortune to a private detective and even then, you can't be absolutely sure!!\\n\\n3. The best cure for this is Alain de Botton's Philosophical Meditation. You must watch the video they have made about it. \\n\\nSorry that this comment got out of control and became too long :- ) \\n\\nThank you for this very valuable lesson!",0,0

And in these cases we should first pause to consider what is really going on, and then, if this is not a probable case of lying to oneself, perhaps we /should/ call them out about it. Defensive Woman /might/ be lying to herself about her musical decisions and insecurity over them... or she /might/ be hearing for the umteenth time this month someone telling her how to suck eggs (e.g. the dreaded 'mansplaining') in which case her response seems relatively reasonable. If the latter, the last thing I want her to think is that it is wholly down to her being insecure - society seems already to do a good job of impressing that on her in such circumstances. [Or I am defending her simply because I'm insecure...?! ;-) ]. Let's not either encourage ourselves to fall for society's apparent fallacy that no-one on this earth could possibly be happy/happier as a singleton, as Denial Man claims for himself (e.g. movies /can/ for many still be good on your own...).

I'm looking forward to Ahsoka Tano returning but I'm soo sad that it's ending, this is and will always be the best Star Wars animated series of all. I know Clone Wars fans weren't happy when Rebels came out because of it's cancellation but i wish they would have given it a chance. Before we had Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, C-3P0 and R2D2 we had this band of Rebels fighting the Galactic Empire.

lbgBzgMzVV8,I'm 45 and I have a titanium hip because a few years ago I fell and ended up developing AVN.  I read about people much younger than me who have AVN from various other reasons who also are getting hip and knee and shoulder replacements. I look at how far that technology has come. When I first learned I was going to need a hip replacement I was understandably worried because a lot of what I was reading was outdated.  Outdated by like just 5-10 years and significantly different. The restrictions and complications with hip replacements just 5-10 years ago are crazy compared to now. The way technology is going by the time i'm ready for a replacement I can't even imagine what the new ones are going to be like.,0,0

LunHybOKIjU,"If you're not familiar with Battle Rap, and you say this flow is wack without actually having any understanding of the presentation and the format of his material, then you're delusional. The flow was great, vernacular/vocabulary is still there, and immaculate rhyming as always; his internals are killer. He utilizes his literary devices very well, decent wordplay/metaphors/similies/assonance etc.,,, .\\n\\n Not to mention the ability to bend words with his annunciation to compose his rhymes as well. I think it's very dope to take two words that you couldn't think could rhyme and actually rhyme them without it sounding extremely forced. If you take closer notice as well, notice how he lines up the syllables as well. Execution still on point. Delivery was a little weak in the beginning, ok I admit, but he warmed up though and still not terribly bad. Another point as well, his ability to vary  his vocal pitch is something I've always admired about him as well. Still extremely technical. You cannot undermine his technicality. He is a beast.\\n\\nOverall,  Dude is still very skilled. Point Blank. Of course we've seen better. I personally think his Shady Cypher with Slaughterhouse is better, but he spoke his mind and still did a good job with  the composition and structure of his shit, and 90% of rappers today cannot do this and If they can do it, most likely they're a battle rapper and I can bet you on that as that is the very thread Eminem comes from. \\n\\nConclusion:  Shit ain't wack, Ya either hurt what he said, or ya don't know rap in it's entirety. \\n\\nGood Shit Shady, you facetious bastard..  #EverybodyHatesTrump #ImGrabbingIvankaByThePussy",0,0

IT only wants to feed, that is the only desire that IT feels. IT is the opposite of GOD.  IT does not understand what it is to be funny to us. IT does not understand what it is to be inviting to us, all it can do is watch everything we do and emulate it, and wait for the chance to strike. Like a Snake in the Grass.  All IT understands is fear. Fear is what it feeds from, fear is the whole reason for being within the behemoth of IT.",0,0

Then Bev makes the conscious decision to come back to the drug store and talk to the boys (when she didn't have to), which makes it special for Bill.",0,0

lLN1FwiqGwc,"Maybe because it subverted my expectation, but I laughed more in this movie than I think I ever had in a legitimate comedy. I hate that saying that gives most people the impression that I'm trying to be edgy, and for that I almost wish I found it scarier, but I could not stop laughing. Even for small design choices like bug-eyes or the voice they gave Pennywise had me giggling to myself and scenes like IT as Georgie getting their head blown by the sheep gun had me legitimately in tears. This doesn't lessen my opinion of the movie, as the first will always be in my heart as the childhood terror anyhow, so it's better to have this one settle in my mind as The hilariously goofy one.",0,0

lLN1FwiqGwc,"Also, what`s that talk about half-assed and stable realtionships at the end? They're 13 old kids in the 80's, how serious relationships even fit in this context? Also, whos ssaying the new It is a game changer? Popular, average internet opinion? Because it has a 70 on Metacritic, and despite you like the site or not (I don't) it hardly constitutes a Game Changing score, specially in a world where criticas give 9s and 10s like cheap candy. It's a decent and nostalgic, albeit flawed, horror movie, with very good actors and atmosphere, weak horror and some tone problesm  and that's something that should be no secret. The complaint about the effects is very valid, but compared to the original, the new one has far better effects, overall. Yes, Tim Curry is more memorable as Pennywise, doesn't make him actually better than the new one. The older movie may be more memorable to Doug, but for me, being clumsy and bad doesn't constitues as memmorable.  The new actors where very much so to me, for all the good reasons. while the old movie is just memmorably bad. I'll definitely watch It (2017) again, but I have no wish to revisit the old one anytime soon. And Doug just brushed over the real problems the new movie has, while making forced and unfunny jokes about things that he considered problems, but weren't really.",0,0

I'm looking forward to Ahsoka Tano returning but I'm soo sad that it's ending, this is and will always be the best Star Wars animated series of all. I know Clone Wars fans weren't happy when Rebels came out because of it's cancellation but i wish they would have given it a chance.

2K57-24FnIM,"1. My mother loves to talk about her prison days in Mecca! \\n\\nI am so sorry that she ended up in jail back then, but frankly, it was all her fault. But there is something very charming and interesting about the way she denies it. Of course, the lies we tell ourselves are always more beautiful than the reality they replace.\\nSo my mother doesn't obey any rules she herself hadn't set. That's why on that journey she didn't care that her visa was expired. She wanted to stay longer , so she did. One day she got assaulted by two thieves.\\n\\n Then the police came and the thieves accused my mother of being the thief! She doesn't speak Arabic, so she couldn't defend herself.\\nShe didn't even had her passport with her so they took her to jail. Imagine to be locked up in a foreign country where you don't know anybody! Besides, she had no idea how long she was going to stay there. \\n\\nBut she was convinced that it was all organised by God, for her to have the experience, to meet the people there, to suffer, to endure and to prove her faith to Him no matter what disasters life brings. \\nSome days  later a man from the Turkish embassy visited her in prison. She explained to him that she was innocent.  And  when he asked her how she was doing she said: \\n\\n I am very fine. I am observing the people here.\\n\\nTwo weeks later she got out, escorted by the police to the airport and sent back home to Turkey. \\nImagine how humiliating all this can be, for a woman in her sixties.. But she went through all that like the hero of a drama extra written for her by God. \\n\\nUnfortunately I am not a believer, but I do envy all the possibilities of consolation, that the believers have.  My mother will never have to ask: \\n\\n Why me ?. \\n\\nInstead she will  firmly say: \\n\\n Precisely me , because God wanted it for me. \\n\\nOh and in my case, I could only say:  Why NOT me ? Anything can happen to me  anytime....And as Seneca says: A ship may also sink at the port.... \\n\\nWell, indeed, if it doesn't hurt anybody, sometimes, it may be alright to avoid the truth. I would never recommend my mother my approach.  If a person successfully deludes herself, and you have nothing better to offer her instead, you may also let that be. Of course on this channel there is a great lesson on this subject  too: \\n\\n Can lying ever be kind\\n\\n In some strange cases like my mother's, this may even apply to the lies we tell ourselves...\\n\\n2. And here is the joke I love the most on this subject: \\n\\n So there is this guy who suspects that his wife cheats on him. He hires a private detective to find out what's going on. After one week of a business trip he comes back and asks to the detective: \\n- So what have you seen?\\n- Sir, the first day when you were gone, your wife met this very handsome young man. And then they went to a fancy restaurant. After that they went to see a movie. After the movie, late at night, they went to your place , right  to your bedroom. Then they hugged each other. \\n- And then ??\\n- Then they closed the curtains. \\n So the husband says:\\n-  God damn it! You pay a fortune to a private detective and even then, you can't be absolutely sure!!\\n\\n3. The best cure for this is Alain de Botton's Philosophical Meditation. You must watch the video they have made about it. \\n\\nSorry that this comment got out of control and became too long :- ) \\n\\nThank you for this very valuable lesson!",0,0

She defended Roman Polanski by saying: I know it wasn't RAPE rape.  The clip is on YouTube.  He plead guilty and apologized for drugging and sodomizing a 13-year old at Jack Nicholson's house.  Thank goodness I grew up on a farm in Iowa, spent more time with cows and hogs than ppl.   Seldom do animals exhibit that violent behavior, except man.

s8GrGvjhz0s,reading this comment section is the reason why we have problems like this in the world. Let's not forget that people like Blake and Emma Thompson have powerful personalities and can stand their ground...unlike others who will not be in a position like that. And Blake had already established herself when she worked with Harvey. Not forgetting the fact that most of Harvey's victim's where up and coming artists who were just trying to get their names out there. Saying that those who are coming for Harvey are washed up does not make any sense. Most of them are powerful women in Hollywood. It's a terrible system and its sad that y'all keep condoning it.

xbBMVa2A68s,"It's so obvious when someone is a dog main. :/\\n\\nCooking up conspiracy theories for why cats are such a high-ranked support class when even back in pre-release, cats remain THE most effective check for griefing mouse, rat, bird, mole, and even some lizard builds. Human players aren't really specced to handle those classes, never have been. For one thing, the larger build size of humans making it easy for smaller builds like the rodent class to easily evade them by retreating to terrain where bigger builds can't follow, allowing them to actually establish spawn points within a human player's territory and also sneak into human bases and steal valuable drops and resources directly from their storage containers. Plus, humans just dumped way too many stats into INT and its skill trees, and failed to go deep enough into the Perception skill tree to pick up on the heightened hearing, sense of smell, or even night vision perks that would help negate the lower tier classes' ability to grief them. Yeah, humans may dominate the current meta in terms of their influence on the meta itself, but the fact is that there will always be a thousand low-level players for every high-level one - and if the low-level players can grief the high-level players through sheer numbers, without being checked, that gradual erosion on the high tier player is going to start showing more and more of an effect.\\n\\nEnter, my friends, the cat class.\\n\\nThe cat class, as you noted, never made the switch from their assassin role to a support role. Why, then, are they considered a S tier support class? It's simple - the cat class never made the switch to a support role because it didn't need to. Its abilities as a stealth assassin class are exactly what human players needed, and so human players started pairing with cat players exactly as they were. The cat class comes STANDARD with all the abilities required to handle the numerous low-tier griefers that human players simply aren't equipped to, and any cat player playing solo will already BE tackling those griefers because it's the most logical, natural playstyle for anyone who specs into the class to begin with. What else are you going to do with all those stealth and attack points, especially at that build size? And then a human player comes along, sees what your class can do(that theirs can't, but desperately needs), and offers you a mutually beneficial arrangement where it shares its resources with you, in exchange for your doing exactly what you were already doing - just in their territory. Like I said, you can look back through past versions of the game all the way back to pre-1.0 and see this logic at work, with cat and human players teaming up as early as the Ancient Egyptian expansion.\\n\\nAnd all this is talking purely in terms of PVP game mechanics, and how the cat class helps shore up the human class' weakness to griefing. I'm not even getting into the fact that the cat class has aesthetic values of its own, or how they've invested points in the vocalization tree to communicate more effectively with human players - it's an essentially worthless perk when dealing with any other class, even other cat players - or their own INT stats that sometimes let them spec into other skills - even some normally associated with the dog class. I haven't even brought up the Purr perk, which - aside from being considered soothing by many players - actually comes with a small but not insignificant regen buff.\\n\\nSo who really needs to explain it as a conspiracy theory involving a cat-bacteria support relationship somehow manipulating human players, when there's such obvious logic to this team dynamic? It's blatant dog class bias. Especially when the article you cite shows that it's an estimate of BETWEEN 30-50% have been exposed to T. gondii, and MAY have been infected. So that's not a guarantee of how many human players have been infected, even the percentage of exposed human players could be as much as 20% lower as you state aloud(meaning you're skewing high on purpose), and - at MAXIMUM - you've only accounted for half of all human players. It also ignores the fact that for a human player to acquire the T. gondii debuff, they have to already HAVE exposure to the cat class. Isn't it logical to assume that the support pairing may have pre-dated the application of the debuff, then? After all, how would human players be getting the debuff if they had no reason to associate with the cat class to begin with?\\n\\nThis also ignores the statistics that - based on the statistics of US players alone - 36% of human players team up with dogs, and 30% of human players team up with cats. So for all those scare tactic statistics, human-cat support teams are LESS numerous than human-dog support teams! But I guess the popularity of the dog class is just because they're just that amazing, right? (And, to be fair - they are. No hate to any dog mains out there; I can't argue with the facts that dogs are practically OP as a support build. I'm just tired of people sleeping on the fact that the cat class have EARNED their place in S tier, as much as the dog class has...and it always seems to be dog class stans who act like the cat class cheated its way to the top.) And, of course, this is assuming that out of the MAYBE 50% of human players there are who have the T. gondii debuff, all 100% of human-cat support teams fall within that tentative 50%. That seems pretty statistically unlikely, doesn't it?\\n\\nIt's pretty telling that the same player who made the video about all the positive qualities of the feline builds somehow forgot all the virtues of those builds when talking about the feline build that ~happens~ to be in direct competition with another popular support build...I'm not saying the T. gondii debuff is completely insignificant, but when that's the only aspect of the build you focus on, it stops being a 'VS' video and becomes a fluff piece for your favorite class because there's no genuine comparison being made. :/ Disappointing.",0,1

8d2Xw8BaoG8,"Top ten hate facts about sexual liberation:\\n\\n1.  Children born in single family households are far more likely for every kind of psychological problem and criminal behavior.  They are also more likely to start a single parent family, themselves, causing the problem to only grow.\\n\\n2. Sodomy can spread diseases and STD's, even to people outside the sexual union through relatively normal contact.\\n\\n3. Homosexual men are way, way more likely than any other group in the population to catch an STD, especially AID's.\\n\\n4. Condoms were never intended to stop the spread of STD's.  They were only ever intended to prevent pregnancies.  There are condoms that are designed to stop the spread of STD's, but nobody ever uses them, because they cover the entire crotch area, and they aren't 100% effective.  STD's can be spread outside of sex, though it is rare, so it is in everyone's best interest to stop the spread of STD's, the same as it is in society's best interest to stop food poisoning in restuarants.  Also, condoms and birth control aren't 100% effective, so if everyone in America started having sex, and everyone in America used the condom and the pill, there would still be dozens of thousands of children born outside of wedlock.\\n\\n5. Women in lesbian relationships are far more likely to be abused or sexually abused by their partner than women in heterosexual relationships.\\n\\n6.  Many animals are naturally monogamous and mate for life.  It isn't just humans, and promiscuity isn't necessarily natural.\\n\\n7.  Most sexual animals also have gender roles.  In mammels, these gender roles can be very similar to humans.  In some species the gender roles are reversed, but they still exist, nonetheless.\\n\\n8. There is very little evidence that transsexuals actually exist.  The only supporting evidence is one study that found similar brain structure between men claiming to be transsexual and women.  However, studies are biased or incorrect all the time, the similarities are awfully subjective, and it is only one study, out of mountains of research that all find nothing.\\n\\n9.  Even if transsexuality is proven to be biological, that doesn't mean gender changing surgery is the best option.  Hormones aren't the only thing that determines gender, because of different genetics, men and women react to the same hormones differently.  We don't understand the long-term effects of taking the opposite gender's hormones, but it has been linked to various problems, including cancer.\\n\\n10.  There are people called Transabled who identify as disabled, despite having perfectly healthy bodies.  There are also people called other-kin who identify as a wide variety of things, such as dragons, fairies, ghosts, elves, wolves, you name it!  Some of these people seek surgery to make themselves look like how they identify, such as one transsexual woman altering her face to look like a female dragon.  How are these people any different from transgenders?  How can you accept transgenders, but reject these people?",1,1

DyA64VLVfds,My name is Gabriel,0,0
DyA64VLVfds,"This is my translation:\\n\\nHe carried the world's toxic waste on this shoulders and couldn't sleep with all the sins of others building up. He had no one he could talk to, so looking for a place to be, or to hide his grief, he went to the beach and set out to the sea, carrying the baggage onto that vessel (boat) with him. The moment he saw land, on his command, he released the sins into the ocean. Because everyone talks to him and he had no one to talk to himself, he got rid of the sins, which poisoned the water and killed the fish. For the moment, lifted of the weight of sins, he felt free. He then went home and sat down for lunch, but had nothing all the fish were dead. This could mean he felt empty without the heavy weight on his shoulders. The man looking like Gabriel, though beaten up, comes knocking on his door. We perceive this as the body he tosses to sea, or the sins. What could he possibly be responsible for? Letting the sins survive? Letting the sins of himself come back? Was he throwing away the part of him that wasn't the sin but the priest? Could he have come back, beaten and bloody, to continue to live survive with the sin of himself? Did he think he had to kill a part of him to be the one everyone else can talk to? Toss away his heavy bag of sins - or toss away the good part of him to isolate himself away from the sins of others - so he could have more room for the sins of others? \\n\\nThis piece could mean so much, and I just love how the video and the song overlap at times. In the video, his plate isn't empty but still holding the food from before the dumping, but in the song it said his plate was empty bc all the fish were dead. I could type so much about this tbh XD",0,0
DyA64VLVfds,"I love this but it's really about suicide. he had no one to talk to and the bag he throws into the river represents himself. So at the ending it is Gabriel but he is dead.

lLN1FwiqGwc,"While the review itself is good, the main problem I have is when describing problems the movie has visually like the sound being really loud, the scene being acted out isn't scary either way and if we could see the actual scene from the movie it would help us understand better. The scene about how pennywise is to scary bothered me to since the actor looks ridiculous and I feel it undermined his points. If we could get the scene right from the movie or even just some images it would help your point a lot more. I know its because of copyright but I feel waiting longer for the risk to be lower and you freely able to show it would help a lot. This also hurt his Jurassic world review a lot for me to",0,0

2K57-24FnIM,"1. My mother loves to talk about her prison days in Mecca! \\n\\nI am so sorry that she ended up in jail back then, but frankly, it was all her fault. But there is something very charming and interesting about the way she denies it. Of course, the lies we tell ourselves are always more beautiful than the reality they replace.\\nSo my mother doesn't obey any rules she herself hadn't set. That's why on that journey she didn't care that her visa was expired. She wanted to stay longer , so she did. One day she got assaulted by two thieves.\\n\\n Then the police came and the thieves accused my mother of being the thief! She doesn't speak Arabic, so she couldn't defend herself.\\nShe didn't even had her passport with her so they took her to jail. Imagine to be locked up in a foreign country where you don't know anybody! Besides, she had no idea how long she was going to stay there. \\n\\nBut she was convinced that it was all organised by God, for her to have the experience, to meet the people there, to suffer, to endure and to prove her faith to Him no matter what disasters life brings. \\nSome days  later a man from the Turkish embassy visited her in prison. She explained to him that she was innocent.  And  when he asked her how she was doing she said: \\n\\n I am very fine. I am observing the people here.\\n\\nTwo weeks later she got out, escorted by the police to the airport and sent back home to Turkey. \\nImagine how humiliating all this can be, for a woman in her sixties.. But she went through all that like the hero of a drama extra written for her by God. \\n\\nUnfortunately I am not a believer, but I do envy all the possibilities of consolation, that the believers have.  My mother will never have to ask: \\n\\n Why me ?. \\n\\nInstead she will  firmly say: \\n\\n Precisely me , because God wanted it for me. \\n\\nOh and in my case, I could only say:  Why NOT me ? Anything can happen to me  anytime....And as Seneca says: A ship may also sink at the port.... \\n\\nWell, indeed, if it doesn't hurt anybody, sometimes, it may be alright to avoid the truth. I would never recommend my mother my approach.  If a person successfully deludes herself, and you have nothing better to offer her instead, you may also let that be. Of course on this channel there is a great lesson on this subject  too: \\n\\n Can lying ever be kind\\n\\n In some strange cases like my mother's, this may even apply to the lies we tell ourselves...\\n\\n2. And here is the joke I love the most on this subject: \\n\\n So there is this guy who suspects that his wife cheats on him. He hires a private detective to find out what's going on. After one week of a business trip he comes back and asks to the detective: \\n- So what have you seen?\\n- Sir, the first day when you were gone, your wife met this very handsome young man. And then they went to a fancy restaurant. After that they went to see a movie. After the movie, late at night, they went to your place , right  to your bedroom. Then they hugged each other. \\n- And then ??\\n- Then they closed the curtains. \\n So the husband says:\\n-  God damn it! You pay a fortune to a private detective and even then, you can't be absolutely sure!!\\n\\n3. The best cure for this is Alain de Botton's Philosophical Meditation. You must watch the video they have made about it. \\n\\nSorry that this comment got out of control and became too long :- ) \\n\\nThank you for this very valuable lesson!",0,0

I struggled with some of the same things you did to an extent. And I know first hand about struggling with food. I'm still learning that eating is an opportunity to fuel my body. And that food can be medicine if you eat the right kind. Thank you for sharing this video and your life with us. It's truly touched my heart! Just know that you don't have to ever impress us.

ZWTlL_w8cRA,"Hey Demi! I'm so proud of you. You're perseverance and bravery is incredible. I'm so sorry you had to go through all of this, but you made the best out of everything, and your helping people too! You did not deserve the pain that you have been through. Remarkable to step up into the spotlight and be this vulnerable. This indeed is true strength in my opinion. It is the strongest kind of thing to try and become who you feel you are, and be okay with being alone in these discoveries or what people think too! Remember you don't have to be strong by yourself, although you want to. Perhaps you want to prove to yourself that you are an adult. However, adults need people too. Don't be afraid of allowing yourself to trust someone again! (You are so beautiful inside and out, and I'm so happy for you!) keep breaking down the stigma of mental health, and the feeling of loneliness. I've felt so lonely at many times in my life, and dealt with depression where I had to get professional help. I think it really is about having a hard time trusting people again once you feel so hurt by people in your life at such a young age. However, like you displayed one can begin to trust again, and most importantly learn to love yourself and others again! Forgive yourself for your past, it was out of your control even though you feel like you had choices, at such a young age with all of that pressure it was a fire you didn't walk into, but basically got thrown into. It's not your fault. Taking responsibility for your actions is important. But the pain done to you, then the media, mental illness, drugs, and all that pressure. How is a person supposed to handle that? They can't they break. But you came up like a skyscraper and it shows. You're a hero, and a role model. And an inspiration. Keep fighting, you help people. ‚ù§Ô∏è",0,0

First it was Trump, then Bill Cosby, and now Weinstein. Why don't we believe in the innocent until proven guilty anymore? Women lie! When women don't get what they want or they want to push their political agenda, they use rape because it's a sensitive topic and ppl will automatically feel sorry for them. I've worked in the criminal justice field and I saw it all the time. I even know a woman who coached her kids to say daddy touched me cause she didn't want him to have any custody of them and he ended up doing time but got released once his innocence was proven. You liberal women need to leave men alone! They take care of you, make you mother's, fight for you etc. And then you have the audacity to turn around and pin rape on them when they make you mad. Just because celebrities say it's true....DOESN'T make it true. And I am a black woman before anyone feels the need to attack me.",1,0

xbBMVa2A68s,I started as a human how do I restart?,12,6
xbBMVa2A68s,"First of all Toxoplasmosis only effects a mammal player's reaction to the smell of cat urine. It doesn't effect a human's impression when they look at a cat, or a picture of a cat which has more to do with their large heads and forward facing eyes than anything else. It is a scapegoat, at this point really a meme, which I have heard parroted by salty dog mains over and over again on the forums as the only explanation they'll accept to the fact that cat memes outnumber dog memes on the internet 10 to 1. Secondly, not ONE mention of the purring status effect and it's proven connection to lower blood pressure, decrease heart disease and negate the stress debuff!\\n\\nGiven that it's been linked to the healing of soft tissues, bones, lowering the risk of heart attacks and improving the ability to fight off infections it's one of the few AOE heals naturally available in the game, and yet TierZoo has the nerve to suggest that cats are not a support class! This is to say nothing of how their rodent catching (which is depicted here solely as a negative) has helped the farmer prestige class and helped shut down plague players by knocking down their host numbers where it matters most, _near human spawn points._\\n\\nToo great of a deal is also made over the usefulness of dogs in this video. While it's true that they _can_ be used to find loot and negate the blindness debuff, due to their slow talent acquisition and the sheer amount of grinding that it takes for them to attain a prestige class few dog players ever develop past the level where they acquire the bark at strangers and shit in the yard skills. This is to say nothing of the sheer amount of troll builds that exist for dogs such as chihuahuas who for reasons most of us will never be able to fathom, place most of their points into expanding their hatred resource pool and their tremble ability.\\n\\nI would also like to add that as a support class for humans, new dog players have to learn the housebroken trait where as cats begin the game with the use a litterbox quest. This video shows a plain bias and sadly TierZoo doesn't know what he's talking about. It is always hard to say that when you see a bad video by a pro who's opinion that you normally respect.",6,1

Much more effective in the most recent meta as the dog players ‚Äúhunting‚Äù ability is much less needed with the current tech upgrades \\nIt‚Äôs also interesting to note that while almost any cat class breed will grant the same buffs, not all dog class breeds will have the same effectiveness regarding the higher level buffs they have access to. \\nCat classes also require much less player maintenance than dog classes, especially when choosing the outside cat class. \\nAnother big thing to consider when looking at Support classes is the amount of time needed to reach specific buffs and the longevity of the support class chosen. While it can take years for dog classes to reach their max potential, cat classes main features are accessed within a few months. Dog classes also have an effective life span of 7-11 years of you choose the proper breed, while cats will remain good Support classes for up to 18 years or older. \\n\\nWhile the dog class has a lot of fancy buffs a human player can cultivate and gain access to, if you look at the time needed, the effectiveness in the current meta, the maintenance of he support class, and the life span of your companion, there really is no competition.",0,0

He attempts to rid himself of these sins to clear his mind and conscience, he‚Äôs problems were lifted and he thought he was free, but the things people have been telling him  have slowly  eaten away at other things  too (including himself).

DyA64VLVfds,My name is Gabriel,0,0
DyA64VLVfds,"This is my translation:\\n\\nHe carried the world's toxic waste on this shoulders and couldn't sleep with all the sins of others building up. He had no one he could talk to, so looking for a place to be, or to hide his grief, he went to the beach and set out to the sea, carrying the baggage onto that vessel (boat) with him. The moment he saw land, on his command, he released the sins into the ocean. Because everyone talks to him and he had no one to talk to himself, he got rid of the sins, which poisoned the water and killed the fish. For the moment, lifted of the weight of sins, he felt free. He then went home and sat down for lunch, but had nothing all the fish were dead. This could mean he felt empty without the heavy weight on his shoulders. The man looking like Gabriel, though beaten up, comes knocking on his door. We perceive this as the body he tosses to sea, or the sins. What could he possibly be responsible for? Letting the sins survive? Letting the sins of himself come back? Was he throwing away the part of him that wasn't the sin but the priest? Could he have come back, beaten and bloody, to continue to live survive with the sin of himself? Did he think he had to kill a part of him to be the one everyone else can talk to? Toss away his heavy bag of sins - or toss away the good part of him to isolate himself away from the sins of others - so he could have more room for the sins of others? \\n\\nThis piece could mean so much, and I just love how the video and the song overlap at times. In the video, his plate isn't empty but still holding the food from before the dumping, but in the song it said his plate was empty bc all the fish were dead. I could type so much about this tbh XD",0,0
DyA64VLVfds,"I love this but it's really about suicide. he had no one to talk to and the bag he throws into the river represents himself. So at the ending it is Gabriel but he is dead.

Cause Colin protested and trump made a comment about them doing it..... always been a fan of em,  favorite rap artist etc etc.  But now I'm not sure yo... this shit made no sense. Almost like he just wanting black people thinking look guys,  I'm with you,  I'm rapping on behalf of you all,  look at me.  And trump never said anything bout black people,  or the black players  being spoiled rich  athletes etc etc.  And now all this gonna do is cause even more racist tension and issues that were not there before and don't need to be,  by saying what he just did And being as influential as the man is knows he has power to alot of people's to cause these shits,  dividing America. He's paid to do all this shit people,  don't you realize this man. He is a rich illuminati affiliated high up involved with agenda to rip us all part from eachother and all the ones that are saying your the Shit EM,  good job em,  ohhh he cares so much about all this shit , PLEASE wake the HELL up peoples,  for real.  Common sense,  well only common to the woken the ones still asleep will not get it and will always follow the Hurd. Funny thing is,  he called out trump to say he's be flying around till the bombing stopped,  but, I bet EVERYTHING,  that this man right here talking this shit,  would he the first one in his underground mansion underneath his upper mansion. Also waiting for everything to stop.... He aint gonna be out there in the front lines helping us or taking action on the bullshit he just spoke and if ANY OF you believe that then I truly feel bad for yous,  sincerely.  We as Americans need to stick together with all colors  and sex.  Real talk.  Trump ain't rhe problem,  it's shit like this from powerful peoples getting us lower funded Americans rowd up angry ready to fight everyone,  going against our  leader no matter what we think bout him.  Ain't am easy job by any means PERIOD.  And fir anyone that's a believer of our Lord and savior which I hope everyone reading this stuff,  thw bible specifically says that we are to respect and follow our leader because they are out leader.somewhere on the lines of that but it most defInitely says were supposed to respect our leader as in our President .  What this man just did or is doing I should say is teaching the young people that look up to him unfortunately and the older fols such as myself all to go.against the bible and fall into the big agenda,  depopulation,  dumbing down and bring upon us our own destruction  . Understand yes this does sound a little outlandish but if you do your research and study for yourselves and read, look and pay attention to every thing happening in our world today specially our own country you will see how outlandish its actuallY NOT!!! Much more id like to say friends and things i know I probably forgot but its late, I'm very tired and gonna stop before I start going off in different directions off topic etc etc.  Plus my wife is giving me that look,  ha.

s8GrGvjhz0s,*It's funny how none of them are outing other Hollywood Execs by name...* Obviously Harvey being exposed is authorized by those in control; he probably messed up somehow so they let him go.,17,1
s8GrGvjhz0s,The question about Harvey was seriously the most RANDOM thing they could have asked her. So out of the blue compared to what they were oreviously talking about.,18,3

s8GrGvjhz0s,"Anybody else feel that she is lying about nothing happening between her and weinstein ?\\nWhen she discusses that part her throat chokes up, which is a sign that someone is not telling the truth. Given that she is pretty and worked closely with him it's a sure bet that a predator would have tried his luck with her. Given that he appears to have given her a lot of support it's not difficult to realize why.\\nWatch her discussing her relationship with him again.

They chose to go on with it to further their career and become famous. They did the drugs, they did the sexual favors, they did whatever these people wanted them to so they could become famous and wealthy. They had a choice and they made it. Now Harvey is still a pos but don't play the victim when you had a moral choice to make and you chose wrong.

s8GrGvjhz0s,If these Hollywood cucks didn't sell their soul to the devil to be famous and actually stood up to these predators they could have saved countless victims. I have no sympathy for these pathetic excuses for humans who pretend to be someone else. People laughed at Corey Feldman 10 years ago when he told the world what was going on. A 230lb former football player was sexually assaulted and did nothing. It wasn't and isn't just woman. It's children woman and men. Fuck Hollywood.,2,0

Let yourself SEE what is going on. No one should have to tell you, but everyone needs to really LOOK and SEE. The big joke is that they are doing a lot of it right in front of the camera. Thank God we don't have to see the ritual abuse, etc. And who hasn't heard Liv is a satanist? Study up, kidz. Armor.",1,0
s8GrGvjhz0s,"So just because celebrities say something is true....it makes it true? Liberal Hollywood always makes it seem like it's just women that get abused. Little boys get targeted too, but feminist don't care about them or the actual statistics on rape. This rape cultural crap is ridiculous. Is every woman in Hollywood going to accuse men of rape? First it was Trump, then Bill Cosby, and now Weinstein. Why don't we believe in the innocent until proven guilty anymore? Women lie! When women don't get what they want or they want to push their political agenda, they use rape because it's a sensitive topic and ppl will automatically feel sorry for them. I've worked in the criminal justice field and I saw it all the time. I even know a woman who coached her kids to say daddy touched me cause she didn't want him to have any custody of them and he ended up doing time but got released once his innocence was proven. You liberal women need to leave men alone! They take care of you, make you mother's, fight for you etc. And then you have the audacity to turn around and pin rape on them when they make you mad. Just because celebrities say it's true....DOESN'T make it true. And I am a black woman before anyone feels the need to attack me.",1,0

xbBMVa2A68s,talk about the ocean sunfish build,957,30
xbBMVa2A68s,"First of all Toxoplasmosis only effects a mammal player's reaction to the smell of cat urine. It doesn't effect a human's impression when they look at a cat, or a picture of a cat which has more to do with their large heads and forward facing eyes than anything else. It is a scapegoat, at this point really a meme, which I have heard parroted by salty dog mains over and over again on the forums as the only explanation they'll accept to the fact that cat memes outnumber dog memes on the internet 10 to 1. Secondly, not ONE mention of the purring status effect and it's proven connection to lower blood pressure, decrease heart disease and negate the stress debuff!\\n\\nGiven that it's been linked to the healing of soft tissues, bones, lowering the risk of heart attacks and improving the ability to fight off infections it's one of the few AOE heals naturally available in the game, and yet TierZoo has the nerve to suggest that cats are not a support class! This is to say nothing of how their rodent catching (which is depicted here solely as a negative) has helped the farmer prestige class and helped shut down plague players by knocking down their host numbers where it matters most, _near human spawn points._\\n\\nToo great of a deal is also made over the usefulness of dogs in this video. While it's true that they _can_ be used to find loot and negate the blindness debuff, due to their slow talent acquisition and the sheer amount of grinding that it takes for them to attain a prestige class few dog players ever develop past the level where they acquire the bark at strangers and shit in the yard skills. This is to say nothing of the sheer amount of troll builds that exist for dogs such as chihuahuas who for reasons most of us will never be able to fathom, place most of their points into expanding their hatred resource pool and their tremble ability.\\n\\nI would also like to add that as a support class for humans, new dog players have to learn the housebroken trait where as cats begin the game with the use a litterbox quest. This video shows a plain bias and sadly TierZoo doesn't know what he's talking about. It is always hard to say that when you see a bad video by a pro who's opinion that you normally respect.",7,2

DyA64VLVfds,"I think it‚Äôs about Gabriel having everyone to talk to him as he‚Äôs a priest, everyone‚Äôs telling him about all the toxic sins they‚Äôve done and it‚Äôs troubling Gabriel. Being a priest he has no one he can talk to about these sins as he can‚Äôt speak of anything that goes on in confession and thus it‚Äôs slowly killing him on the inside. He attempts to rid himself of these sins to clear his mind and conscience, he‚Äôs problems were lifted and he thought he was free, but the things people have been telling him  have slowly  eaten away at other things  too (including himself). He thought he had gotten rid of the toxic but it came back and once more he is troubled, I‚Äôm not too sure but this is how interpret it anyways",1,0

DyA64VLVfds,Can anybody explain the meaning of this song pls,1,0
DyA64VLVfds,"I think it‚Äôs about Gabriel having everyone to talk to him as he‚Äôs a priest, everyone‚Äôs telling him about all the toxic sins they‚Äôve done and it‚Äôs troubling Gabriel. Being a priest he has no one he can talk to about these sins as he can‚Äôt speak of anything that goes on in confession and thus it‚Äôs slowly killing him on the inside. He attempts to rid himself of these sins to clear his mind and conscience, he‚Äôs problems were lifted and he thought he was free, but the things people have been telling him  have slowly  eaten away at other things  too (including himself). He thought he had gotten rid of the toxic but it came back and once more he is troubled, I‚Äôm not too sure but this is how interpret it anyways",1,0

ZWTlL_w8cRA,"I have so many things to say about this. First of all, I have always been a fan of Demi since Disney and her other work. Ever since I have had my account here, Demi has been my profile picture as well.\\n\\nNothing that she did in the past, or anything she will do in the future, will make her not talented. Her voice just blows me away. I saw her in concert once and it was one of the best days of my life. She is extremely talented.\\n\\nI had mixed feelings while watching this. I didn‚Äôt like that the girl at her school got her involved in drugs. There‚Äôs no excuse to do them. It‚Äôs such a shame such a talented and beautiful young woman such as herself got into something like that. What I didn‚Äôt like the most about it, is how she continued to do it after rehab. I feel like she lied to us, her fans. Until watching this, I had no idea that she had not been sober since she was released from rehab a few years back. I don‚Äôt remember noticing anything that was off. It makes me want to watch her Stay Strong Documentary again and see if I happen to notice anything different. I honestly hope that she is real and sincere this time and isn‚Äôt doing any more drugs.\\n\\nI also want to say that I absolutely adored her and Wilmer together. I can tell that she absolutely still loves him and a part of her heart still wants him. I hope they will get back together. Even though she said she is interested in dating men and women. And I didn‚Äôt really mind the casual sex comment, I just hope she‚Äôs being safe. Which I am sure she is.\\n\\nI just wanted to cry when she was explaining the petition that the evil girls at her school said. I wonder what those girls are doing today. I wonder if they see the success she has now. I think they were just jealous that she was on Barney. It makes me so sad to hear the cruel things they said to her, and I am sad to hear that she still of course struggles with her eating disorder. It really made me sad when she said one of the first things she did after her and Wilmer broke up was purge. \\n\\nI wish her the best of luck in her future. As long as she stays clean and keeps doing what she‚Äôs doing. I will continue to adore her and listen to her music and support her. No matter who she ends up with, she deserves happiness. I love you Demi Lovato.",0,0

ZWTlL_w8cRA,"You are such an inspiration Demi. You're pretty, talented, can't even begin to explain how amazing you are! You have helped others like me who are depressed not feel so depressed. I got bullied in elementary school and had terrible friends who wouldn''t stop bothering me, even when I felt I needed breaks from them. I cried every single day, feeling like nobody actually cared about me. Sometimes I still feel like that. The one thing is, I got more confident throughout my years in middle school, since I got bullied a lot there too. I have always stayed strong and never did anything I knew would hurt the ones that I loved. I wanted to be able to stay strong, and I did. I am 14 years old and became depressed when I was just 9 years old. The bullying got to me a lot, everyone at school called me a crybaby and I barely had any friends, and the friends I had weren't really true friends at all and seemed more like all the other bullies than friends. In middle school, I had more friends, but they would always just leave me to talk to their other friends, leaving me all alone during lunch and PE and most of my class periods. 3 students came up to my best friend and I at lunch one day and started talking shit to us, and I finally had the courage for once to do something, I lifted up my middle finger and said fuck you to them. After that happened, it got memed because someone had taken a video of it and took a picture of me while sticking my middle finger out. They posted the video on YouTube, and I felt torn apart, I cried so much and nobody knew it was because of that, they thought I was just being overdramatic. Now I have amazing friends and try to keep negative influences out of my life. I like to help others, like one of my friends, his name is Dalton, he is super depressed and loves being negative, loves the idea of killing himself. He refused to get help. I tried to help as much as I could, but it all became too much for me. He left such a negative impact on me that I knew I couldn't help him. From the beginning, I knew he needed professional help. He fell in love with me, and everytime we talked he always said he loved me, and it made me want to cry. I didn't want to hear that. I never felt the same way about him. Every time I talked to him, I ended up crying right after. He is now out of my life. He will be getting help soon from professionals. I always feel like I can make an impact on people if I try hard, I won't give up on people. But, this time I had to. My friends and my family noticed I was acting differently, and asked me what was going on, I burst into tears and told them that I was feeling depressed and told them what Dalton was saying and doing, and they made me stop talking to him. I am much better off now than ever before. Everyday, I become stronger and stronger, and so do all of you. Never give up and be happy with your life. I hope I can make people reading this feel better and that I can make some sort of impact. I love my life now as it is, and I don't want anything to change.",0,0

I mean, of course that if she was still addicted at that time they could have covered it all up, but i honestly was sure that during that Unbroken times she was healed. \\nThe documentary passed the message for me that even in 2012 during the xfactor she was still in trouble, and i get that her management wouldnt let all that appear. \\n\\nSo can someone tell me it during those 2011-2012 years, that documentary and all the Im healthy now was just a fake? I am really confused and sad if its true.\\n\\n2 - Why didnt she mentioned 2013 until 2016 fases? She was really on the public eye and it must have been a lot of pressure with selling and charting and social media and i thought she would speak more about those days. So why she didnt\\n\\n3 - You guys... Do you really think that Demi is healthy now? I mean, if my 1st question is right they (her management team) could be faking the whole thing again.  I dont really believe that because the documentary was so profound and truthful but i wish i could read your thoughts.\\n\\n\\nDemi, if you ever read that, now that you inspire so many people and its so good to see you for real, focused on sending a real message, i hope you get well, for the real reasons and once and for all.

xbBMVa2A68s,"Great video, dude. I was curious about the best common support class for human players. I've seen some go with less-than-common supports that really don't seem like they actually fit as supports, but allow the human plays to absolutely excel in certain servers, primarily when they're under-equipped. You ever seen a human with the street vendor prestige with a panther or jaguar playing support? There's a very popular video showcasing one of these players with a fucking lion support in south africa. Try to gank that guy, I'd dare you!\\n\\nOne thing that's really strange to me is why anyone would actively play mosquito. They've got to be the lowest tier out of all the insect players, somewhere lower than E tier. Their natural predators don't even require them for their own playthroughs! The devs could totally wipe all mosquito players from the game, banning them permenantly, and the only class that would even notice would be the human players. That's a level beyond low tier if I've ever seen it. Even housefly players aren't that useless. What does a mosquito main even do all day? They have some of the shortest playthroughs I can even think of and are less effective at making an actual change in the meta than something like yersinia pestis players, who you'll remember damn near banned humans from the european continent earlier this season (of course that was with great help from rat players and there's a huge debate on whether or not it would've even been possible without the rat flea mains) \\n\\nAnyway I look forward to more of your analysis of the current meta. You're clearly quite familiar with a lot of the mechanics of the game.",0,0

(Information from science-magazine Tieteen Kuvalehti) Then there are also vulture-players, that by devouring carcasses prevent some diseases from spreading to thr rest of the server.\\n\\nI'd be happy to hear about these true MVP-builds!\\n\\nThanks for stupid/smart/original content!",0,0

xbBMVa2A68s,"Ok so dogs _can_ be useful with specialty skill sets (even though they're usually only companions) however it's important to realize the overall cost to the human player.

Cats, however, are like college students. They aren't completely independent but if you make the correct resources available, they can usually make due on their own very well. They also cause little accidental griefing comparatively and do not have the aggression buffs of most dogs so they can more easily live side by side with other players in a human-led party who they might normally consider prey (like birds and fish.)",0,0

xbBMVa2A68s,"What you say about Cats is true, but imprecise. Remember back in the Bronze Age days when Mice and other species griefed Humans' crops? Before Human players realised they were the absolute top-tier class? I remember when Cats in most Egypt servers were extremely popular, employed to hunt vermin and protect the crops, so much so that it became a meme religion akin to twitch's Helix Fossil; then again, a good 90% of Egypt servers' religion was based on class memes, and you could even argue that it was born out of Toxoplasma Gondiis' trolling.\\n\\nAfter BA was over, Cat memes got old and were particularly hated in Europe servers during Medieval Age. Black Cats were particularly hated, and most of the time their Human supportees were unreasonably hunted down simply for collaborating even once. I mean, I know those memes were bad, I still remember them, but why kill other Human players over them, even the newbies?\\n\\nThen that became a meme and luckly unfunny class memes came to a stop, for a while at least.\\n\\nNowadays Cat supports aren't used anymore in crop farming (AKA farm farming) because we have better Farmer weapons and skills for Humans in 1stWC servers along with P2W consumables to protect the crops, but if it wasn't for TPG existing and Cats lacking CC, they would be the absolute top-tier support/hunter hybrid class.\\n\\nI'm a Chow Chow support Dog main btw.

I feel like she is being thoroughly honest through this documentary and was shocked to listen to her talk about all these signs she experienced that i actually relate to, and it made me realize that i can't conquer all my demons alone like i thought i should, and that i should seek help.

I am not a great singer but i can sing i am an alright song for my age. I adore you. Your story has reached out to me and holds  me so tight. My best friend and i we have this amazing thing in us that we are trying to share we feel destined to be great to be stars. But, due to the area we live this is so hard. I slit my wrists, not the main vain i dont slit that deep. I do it because i want to die but i want to live to prove the people that tell me that i am worthless wrong. My family and i we work so hard, Sometimes i get worried that my parents will die from stress and i don't know what to do. Your music truly helps me. I make heavena songs but i haven't gotten to the demi lovato point. That is a place i wish to be. I love dancing but again where i live it's hard to pursue american like carers. I live in jamaica btw. So demi if you c this it would mean the world to me to have you just reach out to me and help me. I know this is  a long shot and i probably will just go unnoticed in the crowd of comments but I wanna try. Please don't pass over my comment please. I am not asking you to take me to america and basically make me i just want help and it would mean the world to me to have help from my idol. Just listen to my story. Find me on Instagram @highoffjhay I might change my user name so just search my name if you can't find it. My name is Dejaah. Please like this comment so that demi can c it.",1,0
