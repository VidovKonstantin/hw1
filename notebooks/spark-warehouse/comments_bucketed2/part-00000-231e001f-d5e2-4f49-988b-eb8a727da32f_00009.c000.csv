RsG37JcEQNw,Great song! But guys it's almost autumn..,41,3
RsG37JcEQNw,"***ANOTHER COFFEE FUELED RANT BY A LONGTIME WEEZER FAN***\\n(Its kinda long but, if you're a die hard weezer fan I know you'll appreciate it)\\n\\nSo, i think its pretty clear by now that Pacific Daydream is an album aimed to target a new audience. A beachy sounding album following up the prior beachy sounding album that was nominated for a Grammy. Taking advantage of the new exposure garnered from that Grammy nomination, weezer is releasing this album before the Black album in hopes of making another mainstream come back the way Beverly Hills did in '05. They figured, Hey, lets ride this wave (pun intended) and push it even further creating another Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 single. Okay, fine, i get it, i thought Rivers was over this phase though... (cough) BACK TO THE SHACK (cough) IVE HAD IT UP TO HERE (cough)....but whatever, he's clearly not. Id be more upset about this if it wasn't for what is promised to follow...the Black Album.\\n\\nRivers and crew can try all they'd like to recreate another Beverly Hills situation, I just don't see it happening. Pop music is much different now than it was 12 years ago. 12 years ago, HUGE 90's bands were releasing some of their biggest albums EVER because they were still somewhat relevant in the pop world (Green Day - American Idiot, RHCP - Stadium Arcadium, Weezer - Make Believe). Just 10 years before 2005 was 1995...think about Rock musics place in 1995..... then its place in 2005.... AND THEN think about its place in 2017... huge, HUGE difference.....rock music hasn't been in the mainstream pop world since the Emo days of the mid 2000's. So really, weezer scoring another Top 10 hit is out of the question. But again, ill let the boys mess around a while until Rivers realizes (again) that he's lost his audience and has to win them back. But they already have that return fire locked and loaded, the BLACK ALBUM.\\n\\nThe Black Album, the insurance album, the soft padding at the bottom of a fall that softens the blow album. Its there because they know it will keep the fair weather weezer fans around while they play around with the experimental Pacific Daydream. IMO the Black Album has always been in Rivers mind, he knew it would be another Pinkerton, in the way that its more personal, dark, and vulnerable. A scary thing for Rivers, so he wanted to make it when he felt it was the right time to and not just because the fans wanted another Pinkerton. I'm pretty sure they were already making it immediately after finishing the White album but then it all went haywire once the White Album got the Grammy nod. From that, Pacific Daydream was born. I think weezer fans will look at the Black Album as the true follow up to the White album, not Pacific Daydream. Thats how ill look at it at least\\n\\nI appreciate Rivers daringness to reach a new audience with experimenting in his artistry, but with the way the music world is wired these days, I dont think Pacific Daydream is going penetrate like he hopes it will and that he, once again, realizes that disco sucks.",13,1

hqHlIRZnF38,No offense this is definitely a nice video but William does not see in black and white. Color blindness does not mean the person sees in black and white. While its possible that they could that is so rare that its highly unlikely. Secondly if he did see in black and white the Enchroma glasses would have done nothing for him since the glasses only work to make existing colors easier to see they don't add new colors you couldn't see before. I am only responding to this because when I say I am color blind people automatically assume I see in black and white and that is just wrong.,1,0

That is the greatest album to one of my favorite bands that I've ever listened to. I can relate to each song perfectly. These new songs are too much like every other song playing nowadays, no real instruments or deep lyrics. Just random noises and lyrics put together into random places. I want the Weezer with the guitar solos and Rivers' personal lyrics. It's a lot more relatable than the music they're making now.

Also returning were¬†Ja'net Dubois and¬†Steve James. Although¬†Keenen Ivory Wayans¬†wrote the pilot, and he served as the executive¬†producer, he did not appear in this pilot.

o4os5TXo6Vk,"Such a powerful, soul bearing piece of art, well done Jhene!!! This deserves awards. Though-provoking, and vulnerable in its story telling, you can't help but to been sucked in the raw beauty of this piece. I was crying towards the end because it made me think the people I've lost in my life. My Grandmother in 2001 when I was 12, My former Pastor in 2014, and my birth mother in 2016. My Grandmother's death shook me to the core and I haven't been able to to get over it, I've moved on and got older but it still hurts because I was put in the system by my family shortly there after. I always felt like I've never had the chance to grieve, just go in and continue to not think too hard about it. I'm 28 and life has hit me like a tidal wave of depression, memories, pain, joy, sorrow, bouts of optimism, and dissipated dreams. I always continue to survive on looking for the silver lining. I relate so much to this because I recently took a trip to the Caribbean and I reflected on my life and I felt it awakened a positive, and beautiful side of me.

And it doesn't have to be. but we keep on going and growing strong with all these scars within. i simply adore how she express herself and all them emotions. and feel like, at least I'm not alone. cause when we hurt we don't expect everybody else to understand this ache but truth is, we do.",1,0

Being in a abusive relationship for 3 years and losing a baby all at the same time & not telling a soul then when it comes out you feel ashamed I couldn't do anything it consumed me because I chose to stop life but I had to wake up and go through my pain and stop sweeping my pain under the rug keeping that smile for the outside world was easy although hell was breaking inside I had to deal with my emotions in order for me to start my healing 7 months since the last attack/breakup and I'm happy that ive found the strength to push through it. I can totally relate to this. Very nice.,0,0
o4os5TXo6Vk,"I loved this.. especially the part showing her drug abuse to escape the pain of reality but still having that pain creep up on you whilst under the influence.. it's honestly the worst. I've been there. When I was 11 years old I lost my dad to cancer, these years have been hard for me because I became really depressed at the age of 12 & ive been dealing with it ever since. As time goes by... it gets better.. when you learn to let go and to love yourself and others .. you finally become at peace.

Freddy, Jason, Michael, leatherface, Chucky, Scream, Saw, The Ring, The Grudge, Insidious, Alien, Predator, The Terminator, Psycho, Silence of the Lambs, Evil Dead, Phantasm, IT, Re-Animator, Final Destination, Hellraiser, etc...I could go on for days.  Imagine the Evil Dead book being read aloud in Camp Crystal Lake by a bunch of Elm Street kids who have watched the Ring tape 7 days ago inside the Grudge house...and their plan is to open Pinhead's box to get all these curses to fight each other.  That's an extreme example, but you get my point.  The fangasms would be like the Avengers all over again except more badass.

S. currency is used, why not make them full states? Put simply, being an American born on 1 of the 5 island territories is like being at an all-you-can buffet but only allowed to use 1 plate; what's the point of only having partial benefits to being here given that you can't have full benefits like every1 else?

Freddy, Jason, Michael, leatherface, Chucky, Scream, Saw, The Ring, The Grudge, Insidious, Alien, Predator, The Terminator, Psycho, Silence of the Lambs, Evil Dead, Phantasm, IT, Re-Animator, Final Destination, Hellraiser, etc...I could go on for days.  Imagine the Evil Dead book being read aloud in Camp Crystal Lake by a bunch of Elm Street kids who have watched the Ring tape 7 days ago inside the Grudge house...and their plan is to open Pinhead's box to get all these curses to fight each other.  That's an extreme example, but you get my point.  The fangasms would be like the Avengers all over again except more badass.

pCHmqeHEybg,I am not a fan of superheros that don't have a stake in the problems they solve. The entire earth could get obliterated and Superman would be totally fine.

He's so powerful he feels distant and unrelatable.,0,0
pCHmqeHEybg,Why is this even a question???,0,0
pCHmqeHEybg,"I have always loved Superman for the exact reasons you gave. He is supposed to be that unreachable pure good. An example of the best of us. He doesn't have to be dark and broody because there are other heros for that. It's the contrast of his light versus Batman's dark that make their paring and relationship so compelling. I really wish that the current movies would depict Superman in the character's classic light. I love Henry Cavil for the role, I don't think the direction he took with Superman is his fault.

Beerus The Destroyer isn't about being a symbol of hope, he's about being symbol of destruction.

9sjLzdix70w,"I hate when people say Just play the game, don't bring politics into it So what? Athletes can't have an opinion but YOU can? What makes YOU so special? Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and that's EXACTLY why they're  bringing politics into this because they feel as if there's major issue's that need to be fixed ESPECIALLY freedom of speech and Racism. Yes it's true that their are people who are, as I'm typing this, fighting overseas, but that doesn't mean that those things that I mentioned earlier just DISAPPEAR, it just means they protect us from people who might take those away from us ( or try). Also on a side note, most veterans don't seem to give a f*ck about ANY of this. When they go overseas they don't get to CHOOSE who they're fighting for. For example if they don't believe smoking is a good idea because you know science, does that mean they aren't trying to fight for 28% of ALL American adults? No. It means that they just need to not think about shit like that and do their duty. THAT'S IT. So with that in mind maybe let's hear these protests (which happened BEFORE the athem) out and give them a chance. This country is a mess. We can't get better by silencing those who have a different opinion. That's not the American way, and that's not what the Men and Women in uniforms across seas and here at home, are fighting for and that's a FACT not and OPINION.",1,1

YYwB63YslbA,"After watching this I feel like the fruits and vegetables sold in supermarkets were grown under a different sun and on a different planet.  Good fresh local produce is good fresh local produce, whether sold by the supermarket or directly by the farmer.  I also cannot understand why people spend up to twice for produce sold by the farmer.  In fact because the farmer does not sell to a middle man before it is sold at the supermarket, the farmer prices should be cheaper; much cheaper.  Toronto unfortunately has become a city where eating healthy has become too expensive because anything healthy is heavily and unnecessarily jacked up in price.  The funny thing is that you can pick up Ontario/Canadian produce and products at least 50% cheaper just across the border.  The supermarket mafia will not allow Aldi and Lidl to open stores unless they promise to jack up prices.  What are our politicians doing?  Absolutely nothing because it would hurt the established elite of which they hope they will become part of with tax payers money.   The Ontario Food Terminal is government owned: they could easily control the whole situation by simply not selling to those that claim to be farmers.",0,0

Most of these athletes have a problem with President Trump, but when they get invited to the White House; they don't show up. I don't understand why they don't go when they'd have the opportunity to speak to the President about their concerns.

Farmers should spend their resources growing and tending crops, while specialists in marketing should be the ones who actually present the vegetables at a market.  The system evolved this way because it creates value.  If customers don't realize this already, then they should.  Here's an alternate way to think about it: nothing prevents an actual farmer from being his/her own marketer; but farmers make the decision that his/her time is better spent growing and tending crops, and then selling them to an actual marketer for retail presentation at the farmer's market.",0,0

And most people also don't get interested enough in the teasers to spend two hours looking for a random person who may have uploaded the episode either. \n\nIt just means will and grace and other shows in network television will disappear due to the selfishness of their broadcasting networks.

rUkHLs9RHP0,"You did a great job saying the numbers Courtney.  There are people who didn't have brain surgery, radiation and chemo therapy who can't say the large sums you did.  So kudos!\\n\\nMy Mom's first surgery at UCLA cost $77,000 or thereabouts but was covered by all the health insurance my Dad had taken out when they first got married.\\n\\nMy Mom's Second Brain Surgery and Hospitalization with Rehab way back in 1982 cost my parents $1.5 million after the first health insurance company paid. That includes, the surgeon's fees, ICU stay for a week, Regular room for 25 days then she was moved closer to Rehab and Occupational and Speech Therapy every from August 10th through October 15th.\\n\\nLuckily my Dad was a paranoid dude and he as a young man in the Navy he bought secondary, third, and fourth back up health insurance company.  He bought these back when he and my Mom were healthy young people with just one kid. Each successive kid (5 total) they added each of to the coverage.\\n\\nThe 2nd, 3rd, and 4th health insurance companies covered the $1.5 million. Each one paying their share. And oddly each one of those checks from the additional health insurance companies sent a check directly to my parents which they had to deposit into their back account then write a check to the hospital.  \\n\\nI don't think my parents expected this $1.5 million over 6 months influx of cash in their personal bank account to trigger an IRS Audit but oh boy did it. For three successive years my parents finances and taxes were Audited in person at the IRS office in Downtown LA.  And each year they marveled that my Dad's paranoia actually saved my Mom's life and kept our family untouched by the expense. \\n\\nMy Dad was clever and I don't think he ever expected to use the 2nd, 3rd or 4th health insurance policies. When he was active duty military for 25+ years all medical care for our family was covered even my second brother's childhood Heart Repair Surgery and aftercare. It was done at a Navy Base Hospital by Navy Doctors and the whole things was free.\\n\\nMedical cost out of pocket even with health insurance can be outrageous especially when its a surgery on the brain and requires additional treatment and rehab after but Courtney needs it so she can get her life back like my Mom got hers back.  I would ask that everyone that can give to Courtney definitely should give even if its just a few bucks.  I will give a few bucks at the end of the month after I set aside funds for my own surgery copays.",0,0

edMOQR_r2v4,"I hesitated to comment because I‚Äôm just going to be labeled a troll. However, my question is quite sincere. So what I want to know is why the labels? Why be gay and Asian? Do all gay Asians have the same experiences so when you discuss your experiences there is an understanding among all gay Asians? For me,  if I were to label myself I‚Äôm a Christian, wife, mom, American of Scandinavian decent, etc. And I know from my experiences in my life, my friends who are also Christian, wives, moms, Americans of Scandinavian decent have completely different life experiences from my own. I have one who has been divorced, I have never so we have way different experiences there... and even among all my home school moms, we have incredibly different experiences. So really, why label? Why not just live your life? Also, I‚Äôm curious, how do you know some of the experiences you have that you chalk up to being gay or Asian (or what ever other label you self impose) are truly for that reason? Even if you lost a friend because you came out, maybe it was just that you were a jerk now as an out gay person and not really because your gay (please please please read that last point as a hypothetical ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù ‚Äî I still think you‚Äôre quite lovely and enjoy a lot of your videos otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt watch...).

And okay, you are gay, you had to say so, considering your position and your fame on YouTube, but once it is said, it is really your business, who cares? I really don't care, it is not (for me) what defines you. These things are where you come from, and what you prefer in terms of sexuality, but it is not who you are deeply. I mean that there are so many other things which could define you. \\nI was at my son's wedding on last Friday, and there was this girl who really looked like you a lot, at such a point that I wondered during a few seconds if it was you. Then, I realized it was not you, but it was really very stunning. Is this girl, because she looks like you, half Thai and half Norwegian? I have no idea. Is she gay? I don't know, I didn't ask. What I mean, is that your look or even what you say doesn't give a definition of you, since I could find another girl who looks a lot like you and who, maybe will have a very different background and maybe a different sexuality.

It gave me insight in to not only a culture I know little about (sadly, I'm a sociology major and asian culture was very rarely touched on), but the intersection of race (asian/thai), gender (woman/female) and sexual orientation/identity. It's a necessary conversation to have. I'm a white woman and I feel like I benefited so I can't even imagine how a gay asian woman will benefit from having their experience validated by your experience",0,0

edMOQR_r2v4,when i watched 13 reasons why i wondered why they would dress the asian girl that way. i didn't like it. i thought that she would dress like that cause we learn from the media that asian families are very strict and they want their kids to have straight As right? and then they showed that she was rased by two gay men. i was so confused about how they presented her.,0,0

edMOQR_r2v4,"Ingrid <3 Thank you for continuously being brave enough to share your personal stories, talk about the intersectionality of identity, and deconstruct stereotypes. As a pansexual, Asian woman who is more fem-presenting, I resonate with your stories so much :) So many heterosexual men have reacted to my sexuality in ways that made me SO uncomfortable. From men telling me that girls kissing girls is soooo hot (in a sense, fetishizing my sexuality to their voyeuristic benefit) to scoffing and saying, No you're not gay. You like dick, I know how hard it is to be 100% confident in my gayness. On top of this, I also receive numerous microaggressions based on my Asianness while at bars or clubs with friends. Ching chong, Ni Hao, and I really love Filipino women, are commonplace. In any case, thank you for using your YouTube platform as a means of conversation about Gay-Asian identity. It can be difficult to put forth aspects of your identity that deviate from the predominantly white narratives of society. I'm so glad that you are comfortable enough with your identity to be so open about speaking on it :) Soooo much love. <3 ~Angel",0,0

pCHmqeHEybg,"A subjective question obviously, but honestly they all are when talking about fiction, especially comics.\\n\\nI say no, not just because he's my favorite superhero, but because the threats/challenges he faces match his powers. It's actually designed that way. He doesn't just fight bank robbers and guys with knives. He faces down galactic conquerors, armies, god-like beings, and cosmic phenomena. Of course he wins, but he's the hero. What character are you rooting for to lose?\\n\\nHonestly what I find less believable and more eye-rolling is (and disclaimer I do love this character too...but...) is the idea of a singular, simple, regular man being consistently able to stand up against any level of super-powered, galactic, or omnipotent threat. Batman is somehow always the winner no matter how impossible the odds because he's Batman or because he plans for everything. Really? That's more believable than Superman being able to beat Darkseid in a fist fight. A tough one by the way; it's never one punch and done. Superman still REGULARLY is shown to struggle against his threats. He may still win, but rarely just because he needed to land a single punch or something.\\n\\nThe simple answer is always that the writers of any given book, comic, movie, TV show, etc. will always, ALWAYS, write the stakes however high or extreme as they want. Thus raising the abilities or circumstances surrounding the heroes so that they can win. Examine any movie, show, book or whatever and see if you can't dissect it to find the way that it EASILY could have been more or less impossible for the hero.

I am almost certain their goods are not only wholesale, but almost expired donated goods.  We need national regulation like California's.  I get produce from a local CSA, where I can visit their farm any day I would like.  It is cheaper than the grocery and all organic, Amish grown.  Unfortunately, in the states, the FDA hates the idea of CSAs and anything that isn't mass produced.  Our food system is an ongoing issue.  Regulation brings proceeds, which is easy on a mass produced level, but difficult on a local level.  The FDA is only concerned with where they can profit.

For example when i had my babies my C sections and total was about R30 000 (about $3000) which we never had to pay for. Do you have to pay monthly in the US?

rUkHLs9RHP0,"You did a great job saying the numbers Courtney.  There are people who didn't have brain surgery, radiation and chemo therapy who can't say the large sums you did.  So kudos!\\n\\nMy Mom's first surgery at UCLA cost $77,000 or thereabouts but was covered by all the health insurance my Dad had taken out when they first got married.\\n\\nMy Mom's Second Brain Surgery and Hospitalization with Rehab way back in 1982 cost my parents $1.5 million after the first health insurance company paid. That includes, the surgeon's fees, ICU stay for a week, Regular room for 25 days then she was moved closer to Rehab and Occupational and Speech Therapy every from August 10th through October 15th.\\n\\nLuckily my Dad was a paranoid dude and he as a young man in the Navy he bought secondary, third, and fourth back up health insurance company.  He bought these back when he and my Mom were healthy young people with just one kid. Each successive kid (5 total) they added each of to the coverage.\\n\\nThe 2nd, 3rd, and 4th health insurance companies covered the $1.5 million. Each one paying their share. And oddly each one of those checks from the additional health insurance companies sent a check directly to my parents which they had to deposit into their back account then write a check to the hospital.  \\n\\nI don't think my parents expected this $1.5 million over 6 months influx of cash in their personal bank account to trigger an IRS Audit but oh boy did it. For three successive years my parents finances and taxes were Audited in person at the IRS office in Downtown LA.  And each year they marveled that my Dad's paranoia actually saved my Mom's life and kept our family untouched by the expense. \\n\\nMy Dad was clever and I don't think he ever expected to use the 2nd, 3rd or 4th health insurance policies. When he was active duty military for 25+ years all medical care for our family was covered even my second brother's childhood Heart Repair Surgery and aftercare. It was done at a Navy Base Hospital by Navy Doctors and the whole things was free.\\n\\nMedical cost out of pocket even with health insurance can be outrageous especially when its a surgery on the brain and requires additional treatment and rehab after but Courtney needs it so she can get her life back like my Mom got hers back.  I would ask that everyone that can give to Courtney definitely should give even if its just a few bucks.  I will give a few bucks at the end of the month after I set aside funds for my own surgery copays.",0,0

edMOQR_r2v4,"Hey Ingrid, I feel really emotional towards this video. Thank you so much for sharing. Although I am not gay, I am an Indonesian born female, adopted into a white Australian family. I don't want to discredit the amazing life I have been given by my parents by any means, but I have definitely experienced a lot of painful experiences involving inner and outer conflict. \\nIt's extremely confusing and challenging for me when I have been brought up in a white upbringing which of course shape my behaviour and my views on things but I am 100% Asian. I feel conflicted many times a day because it's easy to forget that I am Asian since I only look out through my eyes and can only see my environment and I don't see myself every day, that I am Asian. I hope this doesn't sound too confusing... There's so many times when I've been either subjected to or witnessed racism but I've just let it go because I either chose to or because it's easier or I've not even realised what's happened because I was brought up in a white family with the (unfortunate) acceptance of unacceptable things. I struggle every day internally and externally with my now increased awareness for who I am and what I want to stand for, as I grow older and have the confidence to be more outspoken. I find that if I remind myself every day then it does become easier to be outspoken. Practice makes perfect.",0,0

edMOQR_r2v4,"Hi Ingrid! I loved this video and I understand how important it is for people to share our stories in such a supportive and positive community.\\n\\nI study history of science and I've been doing some research on companies like this. As a result of my work, I really just want to highlight something with 23andMe (along with ancestry.com and all these other services).\\n\\nit's true that these companies aren't allowed to share your information with other parties with your name attached. There are very strict privacy laws and restrictions that are in place but what they ARE allowed to do is sell the information that they get from your DNA to other companies, provided that your name ISN'T attached. A common practice with these companies is to collect information from people who use their services in the areas (grouped using zip code) and then sell that information to insurance companies. And long story short, insurance companies use the information they get from ancestry.com and 23andMe to determine premium rates in certain areas. \\n\\nFor example, let's say you live in a small town in Oklahoma (picking a random state here) and a bunch of people who live in that town have or are carriers of, for instance, sickle cell anemia, and take DNA tests through one of these sites. These sites can sell this information to insurance companies who then, based on the fact that this data (which shows that people from this zip code, more than the national average, have genetic markers for sickle cell anemia) will raise premiums for everyone in that region. \\n\\nI'm sorry for long message... I completely understand that these sites can be the key for many people to understand more about their identities and their heritage. I don't want to discourage anyone from doing anything because ultimately, it's every individual's own choice. I just want to raise awareness of this information to people they choose to use or not use any of these services! Thank you!",1,0

edMOQR_r2v4,"I hesitated to comment because I‚Äôm just going to be labeled a troll. However, my question is quite sincere. So what I want to know is why the labels? Why be gay and Asian? Do all gay Asians have the same experiences so when you discuss your experiences there is an understanding among all gay Asians? For me,  if I were to label myself I‚Äôm a Christian, wife, mom, American of Scandinavian decent, etc. And I know from my experiences in my life, my friends who are also Christian, wives, moms, Americans of Scandinavian decent have completely different life experiences from my own. I have one who has been divorced, I have never so we have way different experiences there... and even among all my home school moms, we have incredibly different experiences. So really, why label? Why not just live your life? Also, I‚Äôm curious, how do you know some of the experiences you have that you chalk up to being gay or Asian (or what ever other label you self impose) are truly for that reason? Even if you lost a friend because you came out, maybe it was just that you were a jerk now as an out gay person and not really because your gay (please please please read that last point as a hypothetical ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù ‚Äî I still think you‚Äôre quite lovely and enjoy a lot of your videos otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt watch...).

I subscribed a while back after viewing a video on your other channel about being half.

edMOQR_r2v4,"Ingrid <3 Thank you for continuously being brave enough to share your personal stories, talk about the intersectionality of identity, and deconstruct stereotypes. As a pansexual, Asian woman who is more fem-presenting, I resonate with your stories so much :) So many heterosexual men have reacted to my sexuality in ways that made me SO uncomfortable. From men telling me that girls kissing girls is soooo hot (in a sense, fetishizing my sexuality to their voyeuristic benefit) to scoffing and saying, No you're not gay. You like dick, I know how hard it is to be 100% confident in my gayness. On top of this, I also receive numerous microaggressions based on my Asianness while at bars or clubs with friends. Ching chong, Ni Hao, and I really love Filipino women, are commonplace. In any case, thank you for using your YouTube platform as a means of conversation about Gay-Asian identity. It can be difficult to put forth aspects of your identity that deviate from the predominantly white narratives of society. I'm so glad that you are comfortable enough with your identity to be so open about speaking on it :) Soooo much love. <3 ~Angel",0,0

edMOQR_r2v4,‚ÄãI've been subscribed to your channel for years and I really appreciate this video as a Thai fan :) I really do understand the expectation of Asian women about them having to be submissive. I guess your Asian side might have some Chinese part in it as a huge amount of Chinese people have been integrating into Thai community and Thai culture throughout history. I have been wondering for quite some time since I watched your vlog when you were in Thailand whether you will come back to Thailand again. It would be lovely to have a chance to meet you <3,0,0

edMOQR_r2v4,Hi Ingrid! I'm Thai too. Now I am the US doing MBA. I have a really hard time adjusting to this new culture.  What you talked about being quiet and not causing disruption was so true. But I'd say being gay is acceptable and people are very open about it. I feel like it's important that you live the life that you love! Lots of loves from me!!!,0,0
edMOQR_r2v4,"By listening to you, I am actually learning something, because I had no idea that being gay for a woman or being half-Asian had such an impact on your life and who you are. Actually, when I look at you, I don't think Asian at all, and even if I did, then so what? There are probably Asians in my own family and I don't care at all... And okay, you are gay, you had to say so, considering your position and your fame on YouTube, but once it is said, it is really your business, who cares? I really don't care, it is not (for me) what defines you. These things are where you come from, and what you prefer in terms of sexuality, but it is not who you are deeply. I mean that there are so many other things which could define you. \\nI was at my son's wedding on last Friday, and there was this girl who really looked like you a lot, at such a point that I wondered during a few seconds if it was you. Then, I realized it was not you, but it was really very stunning. Is this girl, because she looks like you, half Thai and half Norwegian? I have no idea. Is she gay? I don't know, I didn't ask. What I mean, is that your look or even what you say doesn't give a definition of you, since I could find another girl who looks a lot like you and who, maybe will have a very different background and maybe a different sexuality. And if people judge you on that, it is really sad and pathetic... You are who you decide to be.",1,0

That's like being 1/4 black and saying you face all the problems of a 100% black person.  No you won't.  Simple.  It's like being gay.  I dont know you are gay unless you tell me.

Also, I'm pretty sure that you and my sister are the same person.\\n\\nSerious notes: Some important lessons that I've learned in 25 years of life\\n1. It's okay to not fit into the ideal version of yourself as long as you are continually, positively striving toward it. \\n2. Emotional intelligence is important and you should know your EQ. This will help you in your personal life and professional life. Trust me sis and bro.\\n3. Dancing is appropriate in the grocery store or where ever you feel like dancing. Just be prepared for the consequences of dancing in your morning meeting at work.  I am not liable for that.\\n4. Watching YouTube to gain more knowledge but applying none of it, is a waste of your time.  Pick up that guitar and do something with it!\\n5. Doing what you love and the people that you love should never be in competition. \\n6. Travel. I know this sounds cliche but I'm traveling all over Europe right now, and all I see are retired white Americans and their children.  They seem so surprised to see me. A gentleman actually said, Wow, you get to travel now!?  I had to wait until I was old!! Do it as soon as you can.

DeIaemmxMl4,"Loved this, very good reminder to know that if a person wants something bad enough, they can rise up and get the strength to do it and overcome, but the Big thing you missed mentioning, the major source lacking is how Jesus is the source, the one who actually gives a person the genuine Strength and peace they need to grow, a person can only do so much on their own, without Jesus they'll find themselves unhappy somewhere in their life cuz he's the only one who can heal their soul by becoming their peace. Leaving Jesus out, would be touching base on new age propaganda, gotta be prayerful in all things. I'm not speaking about church or religion I'm talking about the real spiritual battle that takes place daily in the mind and heart, (Satan vs self and Jesus) Jesus Himself was the one holding me up during my worse time, and it's Because of HIS encouragement, strength, and friendship/love, that i was  Strengthened to overcome alcoholism, drugs, severe depression and sucidial thoughts. I could never have done any of that all on my own. Love yas",1,0

I hated myself for the longest time, i started lately to begin trying to be less critical, which is not working out great but it's a start, and i have to agree with the fact that you have to love yourself to love someone else, not in the sense that you are incapable of feeling love for others, i fell in love and hated myself, it actually made me feel a bit less worthless, but it was a disaster, it wasn't mutual, i felt loved back but i wasn't and it fucking hurt, made situation even worse after. Before being with others i believe you have to decide who you want to be, maybe my mind is too old for my age but i worked out who i want to be, and i'm trying to and even if it terrifies me i'm now tired of being alone and i want friends and i want someone whom i know loves me back. Sorry it's a really interesting topic and i'm not having the best week, and i overshare on comments cause i kind of don't know if they get read or they disappear in nothingness.

Even though we wouldn't have worked out if I was healthier, we probably would have had better times and I wouldn't have cried to him so much, asking him to show me that I was worthy of love.

RbXYadQw1C4,"Funny. I was just journaling and read some of my old entries, where I found this from a year ago: ... By self-love and self-respect, I learned to speak up. I actually learned to feel love. And let myself to be loved. I learned to open my heart, to give and to receive. To make the room for myself and for others. And forgiveness. You cannot love if you have reserved a place for hatred. \\nNow, these are just my feelings, not marginalizing all people. I had a relationship before I learned to love myself and I loved my SO, and still, do even after a breakup, but it was not enough. I was never able to utter the words I love you, was always insecure about every of my movements, sentences, decisions. And it was a very childish way of the relationship, more of a friendship with occasional sex. I understand, what others come from. You can love even you hate yourself. But at least for me, you cannot love unconditionally, without fear and with comfort. There will always be some skeletons in the closet, which will burden you and your partner, therefore your relationship. Now I'm happily in love again, with the feeling stronger than me, making me say stupid things like my SO is the most beautiful person on the planet. I was never able to say such things, now I'm not ashamed of being in love, not scared of being vulnerable. Just happy to have an awesome partner in life :)",0,0

I myself have never been in one but I know people who have and what‚Äôs gotten them out of those relationships is realizing they deserve better. So I thought you do have to love yourself enough to know your worth and if you‚Äôre giving your love to someone who just makes you feel worse than it‚Äôs okay to walk away from that.\\n\\nSpeaking more from my personal walk of life, I have depression and anxiety and more often than not I will have days where I see myself completely worthless and I hate everything that I am but I know despite that my heart is so full and I am capable of loving someone else. \\n\\nHonestly Hannah I think it was a great tweet as a reminder to yourself and others who may struggle in the same way.

The world is a mirror to our internal experience, and if we don't cultivate self-love we can react really negatively to facets of ourselves that we see in other people. So, while we can love others regardless, there can be pieces of them that we struggle to find love for because we are too preoccupied with our own self-loathing.",0,0

This was a great video which really gave the issue the time it needed.,2,0
RbXYadQw1C4,I love me so much that others can easily learn from my behavior on how to love me.,0,0
RbXYadQw1C4,"i feel like what people usually mean by this comment/phrase is that people who are unable to love themselves or even find anything positive about who they are as a person usually wont accept love from another person, often pushing it away stemming from the thoughts that they arent worth it.. idk but it makes sense to me as someone who has struggled with it",0,0
RbXYadQw1C4,"Awesome, I'm not sure I can truly love myself, good to know it's not necessary to find love",0,0
RbXYadQw1C4,"A couple of points I'd like to make.\\nFirst being that you are in the entertainment business first and foremost. Please remember you cannot please everyone all the time. It's impossible so that being the case please remember to give yourself some grace and professional distance from the comments you see otherwise I feel you will be second guessing yourself all the time. \\nSecond point. When you have guests and/or your friends on to help illustrate a point that you point out somewhere their credentials. The whole video and in the description i kept waiting for something like, 'Hey, this is my friend _________ who is a __________ and/or is a licensed ________ who is with us today to discuss ________.'\\nWithout that information to me it's just two like minded people trying to reiterate a point.\\n\\nAs always Hannah, luvs you since the first day I saw your videos and will continue to do so. SMOOCHES!",0,0
RbXYadQw1C4,I think it is hard to love somebody if you can't love yourself. Cause not loving yourself will lead you to make choices that hurt yourself and therefore the relationship. You WILL hurt people.,0,0
RbXYadQw1C4,"Neurotypical is a term I have seen a lot on the internet and from what I understand it means if you are giving advice regarding mental health then you have no idea what it's like to struggle with mental illness. Being called neurotypical in this case is essentially in the same likeness as someone advocating for veganism telling people with chronic illness that they will be cured if they partake in a plant based diet. That if you drink water and get fresh air, that will cure your depression forever, that would be considered neurotypical in this case. Unfortunately that develops a very unhealthy rhetoric for people actually trying to gain self worth and recover from very self destructive behaviors. No, practicing self care is not going to cure you forever. It t won't suddenly fix the amount of dopamine or serotonin your brain may not produce on its on its own, but it can make day to day life more manageable and maybe even enjoyable. This internet culture of needing to actively be self destructive and that if you aren't your advice or experience is invalid is highly damaging. Whatever you can do, however small the act may be, to bring yourself some peace is worth it. And as someone who struggles with PTSD and depression, I can say that and still be valid. You are not broken for wanting to feel better in your own life and experience.",0,0
RbXYadQw1C4,"Great video and great message! Of course you can't fully love someone (without negative strings attached) until you love yourself (and, additionally, have been loved by others - not necessarily in the romantic sense). Someone who says they love you, when you hate yourself (not necessarily to an extreme) may be just in it for their own gain; there is a difference between reciprocal love and codependency. The *vs* part (the title) is a bit...off? To me if you were to compare the two there is already a clear difference as one is based on one person and the other is based on more than one person; love can be one-sided, reciprocal, or not love at all but a feeling that is confused as love. All of this is okay! We live, we learn. Keep 'em coming chickadee!",0,0

Basically, I've found myself in a situation where I'm giving and giving so I can feel fulfilled, but she seems to just take and take and not give much back. I don't know what to do, because I honestly love her, and I love who she is, and alot of the time when we're together I have alot of fun with her. It's more like she's this amazing friend that I cherish so much, but she's a bit of a selfish lover. I don't know if that's because of her own self love issues, but I really need some advice.",0,0

rUkHLs9RHP0,"how does it work in USA? for example i live in South Africa, we join and pay a medical aid company, you can choose a specific plan that suits your finances, however when you go into hospital for a surgery etc, if you havea hospital cover you do not have to pay for anything that is carried out in hospital. For example when i had my babies my C sections and total was about R30 000 (about $3000) which we never had to pay for. Do you have to pay monthly in the US? I know you talk about insurance but is that like medical aid cover?",0,0

rUkHLs9RHP0,"Oh. My. God. The United States medical care is so backwards. In Canada, all this treatment would be free of charge with the exception of prescriptions, which are usually reduced by 80% with most insurance programs.

DeIaemmxMl4,"How great. I love that. Thanks so much for sharing. \\nSince I don't have any kids of my own yet, I wanted to know if any of you guys had fertility issues leading up to any of your pregnancies or even if you know people who have or do.\\nI have been struggling with infertility for the last 3 years and I'm trying to trust in God. I'm having a really hard time knowing what my next step should be and if having kids is really what God wants for me. I am LDS and there is definitely some expectations I know that there is only so much I can control but this is something that is really really difficult for me to not feel shame and guilt about. I'm 29 and been married for 9 years for the first 6 years of my marriage we used contraceptive. I think, Did I screw this up? Is it my fault my body isn't working? Did I miss my window for having children? and all the time everyone is asking me when I'm going to have a baby. It was easier to tell people that we were waiting than it is now to say we are trying and failing. Any insight or even just words of advice you can give would be much appreciated. Thanks!",0,0

DeIaemmxMl4,"Dear ladies, still so happy you are back. \\nI would be interested for you to talk about cancer and breast cancer. Last year my mom has gone through her second round of breast cancer, the first was 10 years ago. It was a tough time and I learned so much about cancer and about myself. I feel like my mom, though right now she is struggling with depression, is growing stronger and learning so much about herself and her own strength because of the disease. What is hard about it for her right now and for me during the last year is accepting that you sometimes are weak and that you are not always at your best and you are still you and you are still a genuinely perfect person just the way you are. My thoughts, I would love to hear yours. \\nBest wishes from Germany! \\nOh PS I'll be in Santa Barbara, California and in south Utah the next couple month. If you do any kind of meet up I am dieing to meet you. You gave me so much strength, knowledge and are a big role model for me! Love you",0,0

DeIaemmxMl4,"Loved this, very good reminder to know that if a person wants something bad enough, they can rise up and get the strength to do it and overcome, but the Big thing you missed mentioning, the major source lacking is how Jesus is the source, the one who actually gives a person the genuine Strength and peace they need to grow, a person can only do so much on their own, without Jesus they'll find themselves unhappy somewhere in their life cuz he's the only one who can heal their soul by becoming their peace. Leaving Jesus out, would be touching base on new age propaganda, gotta be prayerful in all things. I'm not speaking about church or religion I'm talking about the real spiritual battle that takes place daily in the mind and heart, (Satan vs self and Jesus) Jesus Himself was the one holding me up during my worse time, and it's Because of HIS encouragement, strength, and friendship/love, that i was  Strengthened to overcome alcoholism, drugs, severe depression and sucidial thoughts. I could never have done any of that all on my own. Love yas",1,0

RbXYadQw1C4,"If someone apologized to me directly the way Hannah apologized in this video I‚Äôd be pretty upset.

Mental illness is such a broad category that it‚Äôs em hard to appreciate everyone‚Äôs individual struggles. \\n\\nAnyway, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with the message that prioritizing others over yourself is unhealthy. But recognizing that a lot of people struggle on the daily with loving themselves and are still duly capable of loving others won‚Äôt hurt you.

The world is a mirror to our internal experience, and if we don't cultivate self-love we can react really negatively to facets of ourselves that we see in other people. So, while we can love others regardless, there can be pieces of them that we struggle to find love for because we are too preoccupied with our own self-loathing.",0,0

I hated myself for the longest time, i started lately to begin trying to be less critical, which is not working out great but it's a start, and i have to agree with the fact that you have to love yourself to love someone else, not in the sense that you are incapable of feeling love for others, i fell in love and hated myself, it actually made me feel a bit less worthless, but it was a disaster, it wasn't mutual, i felt loved back but i wasn't and it fucking hurt, made situation even worse after. Before being with others i believe you have to decide who you want to be, maybe my mind is too old for my age but i worked out who i want to be, and i'm trying to and even if it terrifies me i'm now tired of being alone and i want friends and i want someone whom i know loves me back. Sorry it's a really interesting topic and i'm not having the best week, and i overshare on comments cause i kind of don't know if they get read or they disappear in nothingness.

RbXYadQw1C4,"Funny. I was just journaling and read some of my old entries, where I found this from a year ago: ... By self-love and self-respect, I learned to speak up. I actually learned to feel love. And let myself to be loved. I learned to open my heart, to give and to receive. To make the room for myself and for others. And forgiveness. You cannot love if you have reserved a place for hatred. \\nNow, these are just my feelings, not marginalizing all people. I had a relationship before I learned to love myself and I loved my SO, and still, do even after a breakup, but it was not enough. I was never able to utter the words I love you, was always insecure about every of my movements, sentences, decisions. And it was a very childish way of the relationship, more of a friendship with occasional sex. I understand, what others come from. You can love even you hate yourself. But at least for me, you cannot love unconditionally, without fear and with comfort. There will always be some skeletons in the closet, which will burden you and your partner, therefore your relationship. Now I'm happily in love again, with the feeling stronger than me, making me say stupid things like my SO is the most beautiful person on the planet. I was never able to say such things, now I'm not ashamed of being in love, not scared of being vulnerable. Just happy to have an awesome partner in life :)",0,0

RbXYadQw1C4,Thank you for bringing attention to something that is so important. I recently was thrown in to caring for my grandparents and the stress is unbelievable.

It's impossible so that being the case please remember to give yourself some grace and professional distance from the comments you see otherwise I feel you will be second guessing yourself all the time. \\nSecond point. When you have guests and/or your friends on to help illustrate a point that you point out somewhere their credentials. The whole video and in the description i kept waiting for something like, 'Hey, this is my friend _________ who is a __________ and/or is a licensed ________ who is with us today to discuss ________.'\\nWithout that information to me it's just two like minded people trying to reiterate a point.\\n\\nAs always Hannah, luvs you since the first day I saw your videos and will continue to do so.

RbXYadQw1C4,I think it is hard to love somebody if you can't love yourself. Cause not loving yourself will lead you to make choices that hurt yourself and therefore the relationship. You WILL hurt people.,0,0
RbXYadQw1C4,"Neurotypical is a term I have seen a lot on the internet and from what I understand it means if you are giving advice regarding mental health then you have no idea what it's like to struggle with mental illness. Being called neurotypical in this case is essentially in the same likeness as someone advocating for veganism telling people with chronic illness that they will be cured if they partake in a plant based diet. That if you drink water and get fresh air, that will cure your depression forever, that would be considered neurotypical in this case. Unfortunately that develops a very unhealthy rhetoric for people actually trying to gain self worth and recover from very self destructive behaviors. No, practicing self care is not going to cure you forever. It t won't suddenly fix the amount of dopamine or serotonin your brain may not produce on its on its own, but it can make day to day life more manageable and maybe even enjoyable. This internet culture of needing to actively be self destructive and that if you aren't your advice or experience is invalid is highly damaging. Whatever you can do, however small the act may be, to bring yourself some peace is worth it. And as someone who struggles with PTSD and depression, I can say that and still be valid. You are not broken for wanting to feel better in your own life and experience.",0,0
RbXYadQw1C4,"Great video and great message! Of course you can't fully love someone (without negative strings attached) until you love yourself (and, additionally, have been loved by others - not necessarily in the romantic sense). Someone who says they love you, when you hate yourself (not necessarily to an extreme) may be just in it for their own gain; there is a difference between reciprocal love and codependency. The *vs* part (the title) is a bit...off? To me if you were to compare the two there is already a clear difference as one is based on one person and the other is based on more than one person; love can be one-sided, reciprocal, or not love at all but a feeling that is confused as love. All of this is okay! We live, we learn. Keep 'em coming chickadee!",0,0

Basically, I've found myself in a situation where I'm giving and giving so I can feel fulfilled, but she seems to just take and take and not give much back. I don't know what to do, because I honestly love her, and I love who she is, and alot of the time when we're together I have alot of fun with her. It's more like she's this amazing friend that I cherish so much, but she's a bit of a selfish lover. I don't know if that's because of her own self love issues, but I really need some advice.",0,0

Thanks so much for sharing. \\nSince I don't have any kids of my own yet, I wanted to know if any of you guys had fertility issues leading up to any of your pregnancies or even if you know people who have or do.\\nI have been struggling with infertility for the last 3 years and I'm trying to trust in God. I'm having a really hard time knowing what my next step should be and if having kids is really what God wants for me. I am LDS and there is definitely some expectations I know that there is only so much I can control but this is something that is really really difficult for me to not feel shame and guilt about. I'm 29 and been married for 9 years for the first 6 years of my marriage we used contraceptive. I think, Did I screw this up? Is it my fault my body isn't working? Did I miss my window for having children? and all the time everyone is asking me when I'm going to have a baby. It was easier to tell people that we were waiting than it is now to say we are trying and failing. Any insight or even just words of advice you can give would be much appreciated. Thanks!",0,0

I feel like my mom, though right now she is struggling with depression, is growing stronger and learning so much about herself and her own strength because of the disease. What is hard about it for her right now and for me during the last year is accepting that you sometimes are weak and that you are not always at your best and you are still you and you are still a genuinely perfect person just the way you are. My thoughts, I would love to hear yours. \\nBest wishes from Germany! \\nOh PS I'll be in Santa Barbara, California and in south Utah the next couple month.

RbXYadQw1C4,maybe you can't love someone until you love yourself should be sometimes the best way to love someone else is to love yourself instead. I feel that is closer to what people actually mean when they say it and it still sound like a motivational poster if thats what you're into,0,0
RbXYadQw1C4,"I was really looking forward to this video! I really appreciate your thoughts and Kati's thoughts on the matter, and I understand a lot more where you were coming from with your tweet.

RbXYadQw1C4,Hmm. When I was diagnosed for depression and anxiety in 2002 I took you can't love others before you love yourself to mean you shouldn't try to find love. I thought I would be a burden and risk to everyone. That's a lot of time wasted in a misunderstanding.,0,0

Mental illness is such a broad category that it‚Äôs em hard to appreciate everyone‚Äôs individual struggles. \\n\\nAnyway, there‚Äôs nothing wrong with the message that prioritizing others over yourself is unhealthy. But recognizing that a lot of people struggle on the daily with loving themselves and are still duly capable of loving others won‚Äôt hurt you.

RbXYadQw1C4,"My thought response to your tweet was that you‚Äôre absolutely right and that‚Äôs because my immediate thought was about those in abusive relationships. I myself have never been in one but I know people who have and what‚Äôs gotten them out of those relationships is realizing they deserve better. So I thought you do have to love yourself enough to know your worth and if you‚Äôre giving your love to someone who just makes you feel worse than it‚Äôs okay to walk away from that.\\n\\nSpeaking more from my personal walk of life, I have depression and anxiety and more often than not I will have days where I see myself completely worthless and I hate everything that I am but I know despite that my heart is so full and I am capable of loving someone else. \\n\\nHonestly Hannah I think it was a great tweet as a reminder to yourself and others who may struggle in the same way.

RbXYadQw1C4,"Great conversation! I think something that can get lost in this topic is what it seems like you were referring to a little bit in your tweet. The world is a mirror to our internal experience, and if we don't cultivate self-love we can react really negatively to facets of ourselves that we see in other people. So, while we can love others regardless, there can be pieces of them that we struggle to find love for because we are too preoccupied with our own self-loathing.",0,0

RbXYadQw1C4,"oh boy here comes a giant  too insightful comment! so i realize that i am 22 and i'm young and i think i know everything but really i know shit so take my words for what they are. I hated myself for the longest time, i started lately to begin trying to be less critical, which is not working out great but it's a start, and i have to agree with the fact that you have to love yourself to love someone else, not in the sense that you are incapable of feeling love for others, i fell in love and hated myself, it actually made me feel a bit less worthless, but it was a disaster, it wasn't mutual, i felt loved back but i wasn't and it fucking hurt, made situation even worse after. Before being with others i believe you have to decide who you want to be, maybe my mind is too old for my age but i worked out who i want to be, and i'm trying to and even if it terrifies me i'm now tired of being alone and i want friends and i want someone whom i know loves me back. Sorry it's a really interesting topic and i'm not having the best week, and i overshare on comments cause i kind of don't know if they get read or they disappear in nothingness.

I've had depression and anxiety for basically forever and have consistently struggled with loving myself for years. Even though we wouldn't have worked out if I was healthier, we probably would have had better times and I wouldn't have cried to him so much, asking him to show me that I was worthy of love.

RbXYadQw1C4,"Funny. I was just journaling and read some of my old entries, where I found this from a year ago: ... By self-love and self-respect, I learned to speak up. I actually learned to feel love. And let myself to be loved. I learned to open my heart, to give and to receive. To make the room for myself and for others. And forgiveness. You cannot love if you have reserved a place for hatred. \\nNow, these are just my feelings, not marginalizing all people. I had a relationship before I learned to love myself and I loved my SO, and still, do even after a breakup, but it was not enough. I was never able to utter the words I love you, was always insecure about every of my movements, sentences, decisions. And it was a very childish way of the relationship, more of a friendship with occasional sex. I understand, what others come from. You can love even you hate yourself. But at least for me, you cannot love unconditionally, without fear and with comfort. There will always be some skeletons in the closet, which will burden you and your partner, therefore your relationship. Now I'm happily in love again, with the feeling stronger than me, making me say stupid things like my SO is the most beautiful person on the planet. I was never able to say such things, now I'm not ashamed of being in love, not scared of being vulnerable. Just happy to have an awesome partner in life :)",0,0

RbXYadQw1C4,"Neurotypical is a term I have seen a lot on the internet and from what I understand it means if you are giving advice regarding mental health then you have no idea what it's like to struggle with mental illness. Being called neurotypical in this case is essentially in the same likeness as someone advocating for veganism telling people with chronic illness that they will be cured if they partake in a plant based diet. That if you drink water and get fresh air, that will cure your depression forever, that would be considered neurotypical in this case. Unfortunately that develops a very unhealthy rhetoric for people actually trying to gain self worth and recover from very self destructive behaviors. No, practicing self care is not going to cure you forever. It t won't suddenly fix the amount of dopamine or serotonin your brain may not produce on its on its own, but it can make day to day life more manageable and maybe even enjoyable. This internet culture of needing to actively be self destructive and that if you aren't your advice or experience is invalid is highly damaging. Whatever you can do, however small the act may be, to bring yourself some peace is worth it. And as someone who struggles with PTSD and depression, I can say that and still be valid. You are not broken for wanting to feel better in your own life and experience.",0,0
RbXYadQw1C4,"Great video and great message! Of course you can't fully love someone (without negative strings attached) until you love yourself (and, additionally, have been loved by others - not necessarily in the romantic sense). Someone who says they love you, when you hate yourself (not necessarily to an extreme) may be just in it for their own gain; there is a difference between reciprocal love and codependency. The *vs* part (the title) is a bit...off? To me if you were to compare the two there is already a clear difference as one is based on one person and the other is based on more than one person; love can be one-sided, reciprocal, or not love at all but a feeling that is confused as love.

Shockingly, the entire premise of this video is unabashedly consistent with the fundamental economic distribution principles of Marxism and Lenninism, and disingenuously misrepresents the implicit equality philosophy of Constitutional Americanism. Our Founding Fathers never intended for Americans to be economically equal, or for income distribution to be equal, in fact Jefferson railed against it, cautioning against dangerous leveling of society in economics and resources as being detrimental to individual ambition and industry. Your editors need to know this: Americans were always intended to be equal before the law, nothing else, especially in economics. To be sure, Jefferson and our Founding Fathers would disapprove of any statute, tax or otherwise, that would  advantage or disadvantage one segment of society over another. In that sense, our Founders would loathe our entire tax code.

k1vE_LVBx4s,"Good video, information well explained. I'm all for giving the small guys the breaks they need, but some comments...\\n\\nI think everyone of the points made started off with the wrong premise, although the intentions were good. \\n\\nBefore making my remarks, all of these deductions, no matter how much we don't like them, have some sort of logic behind them; let's not display them as being senseless rules just put in place for no reason. In order to make better policy we must look at WHY we are doing the things the way we are. If they are not working, we must determine why the logic behind the original way of doing things did not work and then make changes. So if we're arguing against something let's make sure we explain why it is being done like this in the first place. \\n\\nPoint 1 (charitable deduction)\\nYou started off by saying that both men gave 100 dollars. Already you've misconstrued the logic behind the deduction. The poorer man does not give to charity in equal weight as does the richer man, this is just fact. A lower class blue collar worker cannot give the billions to charity as does Bill Gates, it's not possible. So the correct premise for discussing this deduction would be Dan gives $100 to charity and Steve gives $1000 to charity. The point of this deduction was to encourage the rich to be charitable instead of stashing their extra wealth. If this deduction were to be changed, it would be less of a encouragement for the rich to be charitable. They would still do it but there's no logical way you can convince me that they would do it just as much as before with the incentive. I've also noticed that your proposal was to make even across at 15%? That means nothing would have changed for Dan, the only thing you've changed is the incentive for the rich to give their money away. \\n\\nPoint 2 (mortgage deduction)\\nSo you're telling me that what $362 is to Dan, $960 is to Steve? You said the savings were 3x as much for Steve. Let's compare Steve's income to Dan's. 500,000/30,000 = 16.667 or 16. So Steve makes 16x as much as Dan makes and saves 3x as much as Dan does. So his incentives don't reflect the wage gap. \\n\\nPoint 3 (earned wage vs. unearned wage)\\nSimilar to point 1, you stated that two people in earned/unearned wage categories both make $500,000 a year. This is a misconstrued premise. A point you forgot to mention about the unearned wage category is that they do not make a steady income as do the earned wage category. Let's take for example a house flipper, their income depends on how successful they are at updating the house, location, economy, and several other factors I'm not knowledgeable enough to state. The reason for the gap in deductions between the earned/unearned wage categories is because the unearned does not make a steady income. So the correct premise for this discussion is an earned wage worker makes 500k a year and an unearned wage worker makes 500k a year but other times makes 250k. So if we want to discuss this, we have to look at individual sectors and look at how often do unearned wage workers make the low end of their unearned wage in each sector. Based on patterns we can discuss deductions for unearned wage workers in each individual sector (stock market, house flippers, etc.). So if individuals in a specific sector consistently make the top end of their wage, we can adjust their deductions to look more like the earned wage worker. \\n\\nBias is when a point is presented in a specific light to make the unbiased viewer shift to adopt the opinion projected by the presenter. If a point is presented in red the viewer will see it in red. Present day media everyone. No more discussions just brainwashed democratic socialists and always trumpers. \\n\\nLet's discuss these topics but let's do it in the right way. The capitalistic theme overhangs all of these tax deductions and I think we should discuss those bigger topics instead of these smaller derived ones. Capitalism vs. socialism. I think capitalism works and socialism does not, relative to the world our poor class is richer than the middle class of other countries. We must fight for the less fortunate, but let's look at things logically and not emotionally.",0,0

k1vE_LVBx4s,"In Finland we still do have deduction for charitable contributions and it is as unfair as U.S system. You can deduct donation from your income if it has been made for scientific or cultural purposes.  You must donate at least 850 EUR and maxium is 500.000 EUR. As we have progressive taxation and highest earnings income tax level is around 55% while average tax level is about 20%, deduction from donation differs greatly. So average citizen will get 100.000EUR deduction while rich will get 275.0000 EUR deduction. And if you account progressive taxation, rich would benefit from donation as his tax level would decrease and he would pay even less taxes.",1,0
k1vE_LVBx4s,"Tax breaks that help the rich also benefit the entire country because more money is able to be spent by private enterprise and investments into assets made by companies and by workers and therefore will be making more money.

k1vE_LVBx4s,"So your points are: people who have above average income receives more tax deductions from donating charity and paying for their mortgage interests. You also make a point that unearned income (capital gains) is taxed less than earned income (salary).\\n\\nWhile all of what you're saying is true, you need to provide explicit practical laws that help Dan (poor guy). The charitable tax credit does not increase the frequency of charity donations nor does it help increase Dan's tax returns. The sole purpose of the Tax credit you've suggested is to make Steve (rich guy) less richer for no reason at all. This is looks like an utter contempt on bringing down people who are doing better under the misleading guise of helping poor people in need. Seriously though, How does bringing down Steve's charitable benefits directly help Dan? What the hell did Steve do to you?\\n\\nAs for the earned/unearned income, it would have been nice if you provided some history as to why law makers or the government lowered the unearned tax rate - I doubt that they increased it just because. You did provide why Reagan increased it back up, but not why they decreased it in the first place.",1,0

The other is ridiculous because obviously if they are making over 10 times what the average person makes but get benefits on that equal to what they get taxed (which is significantly more) that they get 10 times the benefits of more.  Not only does a greater percentage of their income get taken but they also contribute a greater amount as a result.  \\n\\nIf you wanted to bring down taxes on the rich that would in turn bring down tax deduction but that isn't what you want either.

k1vE_LVBx4s,"While I can see the point that VOX is making about how wealthier people get more tax relief, the fact remains that they are paying a great deal more of the taxes in volume and percentage.  \\n\\nExample: Person (A) makes $30,000 / year, Person (B) makes $500,000.  While (A) pays 15% Taxes or $4,500, person (B) Pays 35% Taxes or $175,000.  Person (B) pays more in taxes than Person (A) will make altogether in 5 years.\\nEven if (B) paid %15, it would still be $75,000 or 2.5 x as much as (A) makes in one year.\\n\\nBut Person (B) has a lot more money than is necessary to make ends meet and can invest in other things that make even more money.  Person (A) NEEDS TO DO THIS TOO.  If Lower Income people had better access to investing they could move into higher tax brackets and become wealthier\\n\\nI'm not mad at the Republicans for wanting to reduce taxes for the wealthy people...  I just wish that there were more ways, simpler ways for lower income people to GET INTO INVESTING.  \\n\\nThe State Lottery is Not an investment.

k1vE_LVBx4s,"Vox makes the argument that the tax deductions for charitable spending do not actually increase the amount that people donate, and they provide evidence which is supposed to support this. Unfortunately, it does not. The statistic they cite shows charitable spending slightly increasing after taxes were lowered. This is actually perfectly rational, and has nothing to do with tax deductions. This is because when people pay less money in taxes, they have more disposable income. This extra money can be donated to charity. So, as the incentive to donate money falls, it is counteracted by the fact that people have more disposable income to donate.

k1vE_LVBx4s,"As a CPA, I find I disagree with much of what is said in this video.  Dan & Steve save on taxes in different amounts because they are in different tax brackets.  No kidding.  However, you fail to see that Steve is paying twice the rate in taxes! Isn't Steve a hero?  He's paying for someone else government entitlements. If he makes enough, he could be paying the way for 10 people, who knows?\\n\\nThe idea that if we take away certain deductions because it costs the government money is ludicrous.  It's not THEIR money! The money you earn is yours, NOT the government's!  You and I don't live for the benefit of the government, the government works for us... and should do it on a budget.\\n\\nThe idea that all these deductions are not fair to the poor is bogus.  If Dan bought a house for $100k and earned $30K a year, he probably wouldn't itemize his deductions because the standard deduction would likely be much higher.  The tax law gives him a freebie and he doesn't have to own a home to get the benefit.  if he's single and younger than 65, it is $6,300, married couples get double that. The new tax law proposed would double the standard deductions!  Way to go Dan! You're going to save a lot more money on taxes. I and many other home owners who are able  itemize our deductions (deducting mortgage interest and property taxes), however, are not so fortunate. The current plan is to eliminate the property tax and state income tax deductions.  So now Dan can double his deductions and I lose about 25% of my itemized deductions.  I will pay a lot more in tax than Dan, but because I own a home and am rich it's only fair that I should lose some of my deductions.\\n\\nHere is some more misinformation.  Gambling losses are deductible up to your winnings.  You can never get a tax advantage losing money at a casino.  Business meals are only 50% deductible and 9 out of 10 times, it's deducted on a small business return (Schedule C).  If you run your own business (sole proprietorship) and see that you get to pay self-employment tax (15.3%) and income tax, you'd wish the IRS would let you deduct 100% of those business lunches.  Yes, big businesses get the same deduction too so I don't see the real advantage for the big guys (corporations).  Retirement account contributions are deductible for everyone.  Deductions for your income tax preparation fee is subject to a 2% of AGI limitation.  Basically, IF you can itemize your deductions, you can deduct the portion of your tax prep fee that exceeds 2% of your income.  So if you make $100K, the first $2000 of your tax prep fee is not deductible, anything beyond that is.  You might have some other types of expenses in this category, but by and large, there are aren't many taxpayers with those types of deductions.  Oh, and no one earning $100k pays and accountant any where near $2000 for their tax return. \\n\\nIn 2013, the top 5% of taxpayers (AGI of about $180K or more) paid 59% of all the income tax.  The bottom 50% paid only 3%.  The progressive tax system is working exactly as the government has designed it.  The rich pay more, the poor pay little or nothing.  On a side note, they failed to mention the Earned Income Credit... you know, the cash the IRS will give you if you earn too little?  This is especially helpful to those with children. If you have three children and your income is just at the right level, you can get over $6000 paid to you.\\n\\nGood grief!  Now capital gains??!! When capital gains tax increase you have billions of dollars stuck in properties, stocks, and any other appreciating assets.  People are less likely to sell their stock if they have to pay up to 34% (combined fed and CA on their investments).  Also as the assets appreciate, no one ever mentions that part of that appreciation is in the form of inflation so the TRUE gain is not what you think it is.  Your investment isn't as valuable as you think because inflation eats away at some of it, but the tax code doesn't care.  You pay the full tax on the growth, not its true purchasing power.  And what if you make a bad investment?  If you sold IBM stock for a $50,000 loss and had no other capital gains, you get to deduct $3000, not the full $50,000.  Thank goodness you can carry the remaining $47K loss to the next year and deduct another $3k if you again don't have any capital gains.  People who invest money are not evil.  Warren Buffet is in a lower tax bracket but I'll bet his total tax is at least 1000 times what his secretary pays. \\n\\nYou might double check me on this one, but I believe hedge fund managers get paid a salary... plus bonuses.  So they pay the same tax as Steve. I'm not aware of managers getting compensated in mutual funds or whatever they are indicating here.\\n\\nSo cutting the top tax rate helps the wealthiest. That makes sense since 50% of our fellow citizens pay 3%.  The whole subliminal tone is that rich people are somehow cheaters because they aren't paying more than they already do.  Why vilify those who earn more?  I'd bet 99% of the those in the bottom 50% would love to be in the top 50%. Why is it bad when someone else is wealthy but not when I'm wealthy? This video just pushes that narrative.  \\n\\nHmmm... they seem to have  forgotten to mention the Alternative Minimum Tax... you know the one that ensures the richest Americans pay a minimum amount (about 28%) no matter the deductions or credits they have.  Oh did they fail to mention that because Congress can't get its act together, the AMT tax affects a greater amount of tax payers than it ever has... and by that I mean middle class.  The threshold income numbers haven't kept up with income so it affects more and more tax payers. \\n Trump talked about repealing it.  This would be a huge benefit to the middle class.  \\n\\nFinally, the idea that somehow income has to be equal is idiotic at best.  If every ones' wealth goes up but those on the higher end see their wealth grow faster,  how is that bad for the guy on the lower end?   His income went up too. This income disparity is always couched in such a way that rich people earn more and poor people earn less.  That's not true.  We act like no one can become richer if they didn't already come from a family of wealth.  There are millions of Americans that love what they do and don't find gratification in earning tons of money.  These are choices we all make. Anytime a government tries to make things equal it inevitably means pick on the rich and pander for votes from the poor.  This is all for political expediency... at least, that's my two cents.",0,1

Thanks so much for sharing. \\nSince I don't have any kids of my own yet, I wanted to know if any of you guys had fertility issues leading up to any of your pregnancies or even if you know people who have or do.\\nI have been struggling with infertility for the last 3 years and I'm trying to trust in God. I'm having a really hard time knowing what my next step should be and if having kids is really what God wants for me. I am LDS and there is definitely some expectations I know that there is only so much I can control but this is something that is really really difficult for me to not feel shame and guilt about. I'm 29 and been married for 9 years for the first 6 years of my marriage we used contraceptive. I think, Did I screw this up? Is it my fault my body isn't working? Did I miss my window for having children? and all the time everyone is asking me when I'm going to have a baby.

I feel like my mom, though right now she is struggling with depression, is growing stronger and learning so much about herself and her own strength because of the disease. What is hard about it for her right now and for me during the last year is accepting that you sometimes are weak and that you are not always at your best and you are still you and you are still a genuinely perfect person just the way you are.

K28Az3-gV7E,"Hi Andreas. Nuclear engineer here, beta (and alpha) radiation doesn't penetrate walls and they don't really even travel that far in air. What you're measuring is mostly gamma rays due to naturally occurring radioactive material.\\n\\nAlso the count rate you measure can vary significantly throughout the day, which can cause false alarms if you just trigger a warning at a fixed threshold like 100 cps. A good rule of thumb (and what is used in most real radiation monitors) is called moving-window k-sigma, which is that you sound an alarm if you record a count rate that is more than 2-5 times the mean count rate averaged over the last 20 minutes or so.\\n\\nMy research work involves building a mobile radiation detector network intended for searching and identifying unknown sources in the environment. We're using more complex detectors (scintillators) with mesh networking, but I really want to make some LoRa based Geiger counters.",10,2

K28Az3-gV7E,"Check out the company *Teviso* . It's a swiss company that builds *very small PIN diode radiation sensors* . The sensors aren't any bigger than your ESP32 board, have very low power consumption and are pretty much an epoxy brick (they will be the last thing to break, if you throw your counter around). You could replace your geiger board with one of those without the need of any other change. They have just three pins, VCC, GND and pulse-out (pulse length also between 50-200¬µs). Apparently they've since moved to a newer model, but I've used the RD2007 and RD2014. I don't remember how much they cost, but I think it was around 100‚Ç¨ to 150‚Ç¨. The sensitivity will also be very similar to the geiger tube. At least I could easily measure an increase in radiation (about 10x) when I put them in front of an old alarm clock with glow-in-the-dark digits. It's also funny to find out that you ripped radioactive ceramic tiles out of an old house's bathroom, because it's Uranium that makes the glaze bright orange  ;) . You also might look for greenish glass ware in antique shops or flea markets. That's also Uranium glass as well.\\n\\nBtw. I doubt you will measure any alpha or beta radiation with this tube (pretty much impossible for alpha and very hard for beta to get through the glass). But luckily in most disasters you will always have gamma radiation as well.",0,0

K28Az3-gV7E,"Very important topic based on current events and a speedy execution! I think the ifttt should send a message via twitter to uncle sam ;-) ...maybe many people around the world should do that like crowdsourcing! And I am sure that friend of uncle sam, mr jong-un will be buying the spareparts from china but maybe not on aliexpress. Correct place for installation is of course, in Japan but people there are are already worried and very hardworking too and therefore might have already made it! \\n\\noff the topic, the plexiglass idea looks indeed very nice. i will use that for my solar battery monitor which has esp8266, ina219, ssd1306oled and a breadboard 12V-5V power supply soldered on a perfboard PCB currently lying at the mercy of wind and rainfall. Today i understood what spacers are for! I will make it in the 3d printer. Also i thought that esp32 can't read its GPIO/analog voltage currently or this has changed? \\n\\nOf course, i am not going to build this device because i can't do anything about it even if it has a positive signal! but i am interested in how to separate 400V from the esp because in my few projects, like the ina219, the high voltage harmonics probably cause some problems i don't understand. there is some discussion (http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/ina219.pdf page 11) but still not very clear about it. Sometimes, the esp just hangs due to some (high)voltage harmonics. while i get correct reading, because i discard the current/voltage out of range in arduino code and harmonic voltage readings are mostly out of range.\\n\\nfor the nerd comment, this thinking is clearly in line with his friends at other tech companies :) For the matlab component of thingspeak, i think it is still very basic, but maybe that is by strategy to get people to subscribe to their service. easier method is to download data in csv format in excel and use a mouse. but of course it is not as powerful and fast as matlab!",0,0

K28Az3-gV7E,An excellent comprehensive tutorial. I like it. I don't have the time to experiment now but my interest is peaked. \n\nOn another note I saw you show the detector tubes independent of the board several times so I am assuming it is possible to get them separate. I am thinking it may be possible to electronically switch between two tubes say. One would be standard and the other would be shielded with 1 cm thick lead say. \n\nFor 30 seconds we run the ordinary tube and take this to be low energy radiation. Beta I assume since since alpha should be filtered out by air and the housing. For the other 30 seconds we switch to the shielded tube so we are measuring gamma. Assuming near constant radiation in an event the difference can dive us an indication of the strength of the radiation we are dealing with.\n\nOf course we can just put the entire Geiger device in a shielded case  with connections outside but that would not be automatic like the proposal above. \n\nWhat do you think? Am I making any sense?,0,0

k1vE_LVBx4s,"wow, nothing but stupid one sided talking points. Capital gains income comes from investments. you are also taxed on your salary which you use to invest so you are being taxed twice on that money. If you dont draw a salary and your income ONLY comes from investments then you can only be taxed at the rate of the investments. Someone earning 400,000 a year may be only 5% of the population but hey pay in way more than middle income ever will and the top 1% pays even more than every other tax bracket. The highest wage earners are still going to benefit no matter what you do with the tax rate because they can afford to pay people to find deductions and ways to not pay as much in taxes. If you lower their tax rate as well as everyone elses they have more available cash to spend or use to pay down their bills which is a good thing because it generates capital in all areas of life from services to goods and investments. This is supply side economics. It doesnt matter if someone buys a big screen TV or a yacht as long as they are buying something someone else made so demand goes up and jobs are created which creates more taxable income.\\n\\nAnd if Warren Buffet wants to send a donation to the IRS he can do it any day.

k1vE_LVBx4s,"I have a sincere question for those that support this video. I believe this video ignores the fact that the bigger savings realized by the wealthy individual is only AFTER they paid the same amount of taxes the poor person did on the first $100,000 of income. However, after the first $100,000, when the poorer person stops paying taxes, the richer person continues to pay taxes at an increasing tax rate until the stipulated $500,000 of annual income is reached. I.E. as the yearly income increases, so does the rate up to 39%. In other words, the rich person realizes greater savings because they are deducting the stated expense from the higher taxes rate on the final dollars the poorer person never pays. \\n\\nUp until the first $100,000 of annual income, the rich person and the poor person pay the same income tax and  receive the same tax deduction benefit. \\n\\nHowever, since the rich person makes more, he begins to pay more and more taxes on every increasing dollar he earns, so of course the tax deduction is greater because of math. \\n\\nAm I understanding this incorrectly?

Like when I was in college I was able to get the American Opportunity Tax Credit as a refundable credit - that was like a bonus from the government. Or like how I get a deduction on student loan interest and that is a relief. When I started to make more though that was taken away. You are taxed on what you make during the year, and if you sustained a loss in your business, then yes, you can carryover those losses and you can count against what you make in future. Recently, the net investment income tax raised the amount taken from the rich. I think it's fair. The tax rate is way higher for the rich so at a base point it's not a problem. People get all ticked about rich people taxes as if they even understand it.

It also failed to mention that Dan would pay less in tax even with a 12% tax bracket since the standard deduction would shield over $12K of his income from taxes, which means it's mathematically impossible for him to pay more taxes if that plan were enacted as described.\\n\\nNext, this video is saying that Dan gets less of a benefit than Steve on many things. Unfortunately, this video is missing the point entirely. Dan gets more benefit than Steve relative to Dan's level of income when it comes to mortgage interest deductions. \\n\\nExample:\\n\\nDan saves $362 from his interest deduction, which is equal to 1.2% of Dan's income. Steve saves $960 on same sized interest deduction, which is equal to 0.2% of Steve's income. In other words, Dan gets six times the benefit relative to his income than does Steve. This is a consequence of a progressive tax system.\\n\\nBut what if Dan and Steve both paid 15% income tax. That would eliminate this problem altogether, would it not? Now Steve would pay $362, just like Dan. Obviously, that's not what the people making this video are advocating.\\n\\nFurthermore, saying that the wealthy benefit mostly from mortgage interest deductions is silly, because a household making $200K a year isn't wealthy. It's middle class. The middle class disproportionately benefit from mortgage interest deductions. The genuinely wealthy usually own their home(s) outright.\\n\\nAnyway, as others have already noted, higher income earners pay a greater share of taxes by far then the percent of income earned:\\n\\nIn 2013, the bottom 50 percent of taxpayers (those with AGIs below $36,841) earned 11.49 percent of total AGI. This group of taxpayers paid approximately $34 billion in taxes, or 2.78 percent of all income taxes in 2013. In contrast, the top 1 percent of all taxpayers (taxpayers with AGIs of $428,713 and above), earned 19.04 percent of all AGI in 2013, but paid 37.80 percent of all federal income taxes. In 2013, the top 1 percent of taxpayers accounted for more income taxes paid than the bottom 90 percent combined. The top 1 percent of taxpayers paid $465 billion, or 37.80 percent of all income taxes, while the bottom 90 percent paid $372 billion, or 30.20 percent of all income taxes.\\n\\nhttps://taxfoundation.org/summary-latest-federal-income-tax-data-2015-update/\\n\\nBottom 50% were 11.49% a income, but paid 2.78% on income taxes.\\nTop 1% were 19.04 percent of income, and paid 37.80% of income taxes.\\n\\nClearly, the top shoulders more than their representative share of taxes, many times more.\\n\\n\\n\\nCapital gains is NOT about frequently buying and selling stock. If you do that, it's taxed as regular income. The only exception to this is futures contracts, which is why people with modest portfolios got into managed futures accounts in the last decade since it did allow part of the profits to be taxed as if they are capital gains. However, equities (stocks, bonds, etc.) will always be taxed as income if profits are realized within a calendar year after those assets were purchased. If you hold them longer than a year, then they are not. Generally speaking, people who are in the stock market just hold their stocks for years and years. If you have a 401K, this includes you.\\n\\nThe hedge fund manager example is misguided too. If Laurie has her own money in the hedge fund, then profits she earns on HER money will be taxed as capital gains as long as time it took her to make that money exceeds one year. However, any share of the profits she gets from client's money is taxed as income to her, but would be capital gains to them as long as the hold time was long enough. \\n\\nWarren Buffett is a stakeholder in Berkshire Hathaway, which is his investment company who's assets are the stocks the company is invested in. Since Berkshire issues its own shares, and Buffet owns about 11% of those shares, and he is a long term investor, his income is taxed as capital gains. However, if he was NOT a stakeholder but derived income as a salary, then he would pay a higher tax rate. The point is that your income tax as a fund manager is dictated by what equity you have in the fund. If you have none but you are paid to manage the fund, then you will pay regular income tax.\\n\\nLastly, as far as charity is concerned, if you do the math you'll see that if your tax rate is above 50%, then you should give half your earnings to charity as you will take home more money overall, BUT if the tax rate is below 50% then it's better to not give to charity at all IF you want to take home as much money as possible.",1,0

K28Az3-gV7E,"Hi Andreas. Nuclear engineer here, beta (and alpha) radiation doesn't penetrate walls and they don't really even travel that far in air. What you're measuring is mostly gamma rays due to naturally occurring radioactive material.\\n\\nAlso the count rate you measure can vary significantly throughout the day, which can cause false alarms if you just trigger a warning at a fixed threshold like 100 cps. A good rule of thumb (and what is used in most real radiation monitors) is called moving-window k-sigma, which is that you sound an alarm if you record a count rate that is more than 2-5 times the mean count rate averaged over the last 20 minutes or so.\\n\\nMy research work involves building a mobile radiation detector network intended for searching and identifying unknown sources in the environment. We're using more complex detectors (scintillators) with mesh networking, but I really want to make some LoRa based Geiger counters.",12,3

Sometimes, the esp just hangs due to some (high)voltage harmonics. while i get correct reading, because i discard the current/voltage out of range in arduino code and harmonic voltage readings are mostly out of range.\\n\\nfor the nerd comment, this thinking is clearly in line with his friends at other tech companies :) For the matlab component of thingspeak, i think it is still very basic, but maybe that is by strategy to get people to subscribe to their service. easier method is to download data in csv format in excel and use a mouse. but of course it is not as powerful and fast as matlab!",0,0

K28Az3-gV7E,An excellent comprehensive tutorial. I like it. I don't have the time to experiment now but my interest is peaked. \n\nOn another note I saw you show the detector tubes independent of the board several times so I am assuming it is possible to get them separate. I am thinking it may be possible to electronically switch between two tubes say. One would be standard and the other would be shielded with 1 cm thick lead say. \n\nFor 30 seconds we run the ordinary tube and take this to be low energy radiation. Beta I assume since since alpha should be filtered out by air and the housing. For the other 30 seconds we switch to the shielded tube so we are measuring gamma. Assuming near constant radiation in an event the difference can dive us an indication of the strength of the radiation we are dealing with.\n\nOf course we can just put the entire Geiger device in a shielded case  with connections outside but that would not be automatic like the proposal above. \n\nWhat do you think? Am I making any sense?,0,0

K28Az3-gV7E,"Check out the company *Teviso* . It's a swiss company that builds *very small PIN diode radiation sensors* . The sensors aren't any bigger than your ESP32 board, have very low power consumption and are pretty much an epoxy brick (they will be the last thing to break, if you throw your counter around). You could replace your geiger board with one of those without the need of any other change. They have just three pins, VCC, GND and pulse-out (pulse length also between 50-200¬µs). Apparently they've since moved to a newer model, but I've used the RD2007 and RD2014. I don't remember how much they cost, but I think it was around 100‚Ç¨ to 150‚Ç¨. The sensitivity will also be very similar to the geiger tube. At least I could easily measure an increase in radiation (about 10x) when I put them in front of an old alarm clock with glow-in-the-dark digits. It's also funny to find out that you ripped radioactive ceramic tiles out of an old house's bathroom, because it's Uranium that makes the glaze bright orange  ;) . You also might look for greenish glass ware in antique shops or flea markets. That's also Uranium glass as well.\\n\\nBtw. I doubt you will measure any alpha or beta radiation with this tube (pretty much impossible for alpha and very hard for beta to get through the glass). But luckily in most disasters you will always have gamma radiation as well.",0,1
K28Az3-gV7E,"Always test any project you made! For this project you have two options:\\n- Order a Geiger-M√ºller-Tester from Ebay. But, these are expensive and only sold from North Korea, USA or maybe Russia. For an additional fee they even launch it for you. You can also test your atomic shelter with the same device.\\n- If you do not like the above project, then use the high mountains in Switzerland. Would be interesting to get some values from 3000m (or even 4000m).",1,1

I also found some helpful articles on techtutorialsx, e.g. https://techtutorialsx.com/2017/05/09/esp32-get-task-execution-core/ Here is decribed how to find out on which core a Task is running by adding some lines of code into the source.

Nobody got hurt, they got drowned out to the point that most people in the stadium weren't even aware of it, and it didn't prevent TP from coming back. And it wasn't Georgia.\\n\\nAlso, after reading the comments here, I can't help but ask, What would Tom say? If he were playing a tribute to someone who had passed away and people in the audience started shouting him down because they didn't like him (yes, that's hard to imagine, but stay with me here), I suspect his reaction would be something like this: Stop the song and tell everyone, Look, this isn't about me, this is about paying tribute to someone who has moved on. So I'm just asking that you put your hate away for a  few minutes and let us honor this person that we all love. And because he's Tom Petty, everyone would do just that and he'd finish the song.\\n\\nOf course, I am not as awesome as Tom Petty, so I won't be surprised when this gets trolled instead. (But I am just awesome enough not to let it bother me. Troll is as troll does.)

xyDIy9ggcTc,"Dear Friends... This man has passed on like we all will very shortly.  He will likely be remembered by many for his God given talent.  His passing should make us reflect all the more on our own short mortality.  The rate of death I am told is 100%  We could die at any time and from anything a virus, cancer, heart attack, stroke, high blood pressure, age, stress you name it.\\n\\nHave you ever stopped to really think about how little time you may have left on this planet?  I mean really let it sink in and think about it.  Friend..Do you know absolutely sure 100% if you died today where you would go?\\n\\nThere is a real place called heaven, and one called hell.   Hell is said to be eternal torment and separation from God, where there is no more hope ever.  Likely a most horrid place you wouldn't want any one to go for 5 minutes let alone trillions upon trillions of years...forever.  \\nSee here; \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5gv-V9axtg\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLOAUB9Vjo0\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vywj182oFw\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDsn5v4pdgY\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmp3UNjeu0k\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15k-1V2gx6I\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2G6yFeWmw8\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYAVkuNk8pU\\n\\nFortunately God desires all to come be with him forever and it is an awesome place beyond description forever and ever...\\nTo make this possible Jesus came to pay for our punishment our sin, our destination without God, and to bring us home to the most awesome, loving inconceivable place for all eternity. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\\n\\nAlso all of us have done wrong things and broken laws that God gave us.  Don't worry you don't get to heaven by being a good person.  And there aren't many different paths to heaven.  Fortunately there is a way that everyone who has done bad things can change and go to heaven forever and ever.  God said there is only one way to heaven..not many paths and fortunately we don't get there by being a good person\\n\\nIn John 14:6 Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúI am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Nobody goes to heaven without Jesus.  Plain and simple that is how we go to heaven.  Not by being good, or following many different paths...it comes down to Jesus and Jesus alone.  What is required?  Well we learn that what is required is to repent of our wrong doings, and believe on the Jesus, and endure to the end of our lives continuing in our faith in Jesus.\\n\\nIt all comes down to this...will you Believe on and Trust Jesus today?  Change your eternal destiny right now be laying your trust in the only thing that can save us and fill the void in our hearts. Jesus Christ.\\n\\nWill you trust on him Before its too late!\\n\\nYou will all meet him VERY Soon whether in this life or the soon coming afterlife!\\n\\nWill you put your trust in him right now friend?\\n\\nPlease let this settle in deeply.  When you draw your last breath that God gives you, which could happen any moment.  In that moment you draw your last breath...the only thing that will matter is What YOU did with Jesus in this life....nothing else at all in that moment will matter..nothing else (everything but that is temporary and fading).  What you did with Jesus in this life will be the ONLY thing left that will matter in the moment you draw your final breath.  You cannot at this time begin to conceive just how important this message is.  I pray that you will take heed to it while their is still a short time for you to do so, and it is everlastingly too late for you.  Please friends do not ignore or delay in this serious message about turning to Jesus right now, and truly following him the rest of your days. \\n\\nHas anyone ever told you that: GOD LOVES YOU & has a wonderful plan for your life?\\nI have a real quick but important question to ask you... If you died tonight, would you go to heaven?\\n\\nTime is running out for all of us.\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN5g7gChGVE\\n\\nLuke 21:25-28\\n25 And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring;\\n26 Men's hearts failing them for fear, and for looking after those things which are coming on the earth: for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.\\n27 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with power and great glory.\\n28 And when these things begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemption draweth nigh.\\n\\nThe good news is everything can change for you and all of us in an instant with God.\\nHas anyone ever told you that: GOD LOVES YOU & has a wonderful plan for your life?

Qg7YzqCRoZ0,"Aw man, I was expecting you to mention the Mexican volcanoes Popocat√©petl and Iztacc√≠huatl, they have a legend about an Aztec princess named Iztacc√≠huatl that is in love with a handsome warrior named Popocat√©petl, and they swore to marry if he came back after winning the war against the Tlaxcalans. But Popocat√©petl's love rival overheard this and, jealous, told Iztacc√≠huatl that his fianc√© had died in battle. Heartbroken by this lie, she died. Some time later, Popocat√©petl came back victorious to find out that his future wife had died. He became depressed, and wandered for days until he found a way to honor her death: he piled up 10 mountains to make a grave, took the princess in his arms and gently laid her down on top of the giant mountain, he kissed her, took a torch and kneeled before her to mourn her eternal slumber. They have been together since that day and his heart still beats bright red with the love for his princess.\\nI think it's a beautiful story and the Lava short reminded me of it when I first watched it c:",0,0

But Popocat√©petl's love rival overheard this and, jealous, told Iztacc√≠huatl that his fianc√© had died in battle. Heartbroken by this lie, she died. Some time later, Popocat√©petl came back victorious to find out that his future wife had died. He became depressed, and wandered for days until he found a way to honor her death: he piled up 10 mountains to make a grave, took the princess in his arms and gently laid her down on top of the giant mountain, he kissed her, took a torch and kneeled before her to mourn her eternal slumber. They have been together since that day and his heart still beats bright red with the love for his princess.\\nI think it's a beautiful story and the Lava short reminded me of it when I first watched it c:",0,0

Hawaiian Ocean. --But not just that! That mostly includes LAVA, Lilo & Stitch, and a little bit of Finding nemo.\\nOf course we are going pretty far with a sea turtle theme now, but I am obsessed with wanting a huge picture of UKU & LELE over where the crib will be (SQUEE!) Of course I am working on that myself! But it will be so cute having those volcanoes sweetly watching over the baby!\\n\\nlol we are no where near even starting (nevermind completing) the baby room, but That is just my spiel on how much we loved LAVA too!!!

HzzmqUoQobc,"Music isn't just about repetition. What people don't enjoy is repetition. What we do enjoy is noticing patterns. Even in their example by beyonce, the background beat and foreground music are not dead repeats, they are patterned verses. The tonality of the background changing while it's rhythm stays the same, the lyrics alterations of the same phrase with different timed echos in the back.",1,0

Qg7YzqCRoZ0,"LOL! I always have a real hoot watching your videos, though I havn't seen any in a bit, of course anything titled after LAVA would catch my attention! XD \\nI Absolutely Love LAVA!

XD so darn cewt dem volcanoes!\\nAnyways we love singing it all the time, and then earlier this year when we found out we were pregnant, we knew our nursery theme INSTANTLY! Hawaiian Ocean. --But not just that! That mostly includes LAVA, Lilo & Stitch, and a little bit of Finding nemo.\\nOf course we are going pretty far with a sea turtle theme now, but I am obsessed with wanting a huge picture of UKU & LELE over where the crib will be (SQUEE!) Of course I am working on that myself! But it will be so cute having those volcanoes sweetly watching over the baby!\\n\\nlol we are no where near even starting (nevermind completing) the baby room, but That is just my spiel on how much we loved LAVA too!!!

Qg7YzqCRoZ0,Yes Ukulele is pronounced oo-koo-le-le. And uku means lice/flea. Lele means to jump. So jumping flea. Which describes what the Hawaiian people saw when the Portuguese people brought the braguinha and played it for them. Fingers jumping around the fret board like fleas.,0,0

But Popocat√©petl's love rival overheard this and, jealous, told Iztacc√≠huatl that his fianc√© had died in battle. Heartbroken by this lie, she died. Some time later, Popocat√©petl came back victorious to find out that his future wife had died. He became depressed, and wandered for days until he found a way to honor her death: he piled up 10 mountains to make a grave, took the princess in his arms and gently laid her down on top of the giant mountain, he kissed her, took a torch and kneeled before her to mourn her eternal slumber. They have been together since that day and his heart still beats bright red with the love for his princess.\\nI think it's a beautiful story and the Lava short reminded me of it when I first watched it c:",0,0

New cars sold today will all work like this (though there are always random exceptions). As you go back in model years, it will vary manufacturer to manufacturer which completely shut off fuel or continue to inject.

There is a hundred of ways to get a central message in a song to be portrayed but repetition is a terrible way to do it. There are some amazing musicians and lyricists around the world who right amazing music but it all gets oveshadowed by rubbish pop music that is produced as a money grab.,0,0

It cause emotions to build whether they be sadness, anger or the feeling of courage before a battle. It allows the brain to be a part of the song rather than surprised by it. Repetition is a straight flight to the destination rather than a bunch of stops and starts which is the essential difference between pop and jazz or even somewhat classical music.

_bZlb62VVlw,"Question: engine braking in 3rd gear vs engine braking in 5th gear - no gas is used, but in 5th gear you don't lose your speed that much right?",0,0
_bZlb62VVlw,"I have to disagree with you on this assessment. I have a 2012 Subaru Impreza, so my MPG display is exactly the same as yours. Also manual transmission. When cruising, engine braking will start to drop MPG from 99.9 before it will in neutral (i.e., at low speeds, active MPG will still show 99.9 in neutral while engine braking at the same speed will be lower). I think fuel expenditure when your foot is OFF the gas will be the SAME, whether in neutral or engine braking - but neutral will take you further and therefore is more efficient for the same distance traveled. I don't think the car computer is smart enough to measure true MPG. It simply performs a simple calculation based on a function of your speed and your RPM. When you're in neutral, the engine has to keep running, it can't just stop (unless it is a hybrid, which it isn't), so it will consume just enough fuel to keep itself running at low RPM, hence the 99.9. During engine braking, the engine can't just stop combusting (which it would have to do if it were consuming zero fuel as you assert). It is still burning the same amount of fuel as at idle, but the engine braking pushes the RPM higher. The car computer interprets that as higher RPM per speed and therefore spits out a lower MPG. In other words, coasting in neutral is always more efficient in terms of gas (although not in terms of brake pad wear).",0,0
_bZlb62VVlw,"Hey Jason, this has bugged me since I bought my brand new Nissan Altima. When I turn on the AC, my rpms are set dead at 750. In fact, that's the normal idle at all times, and it confuses me a bit. I thought, at least, the AC would make it churn more rpms, but this car doesn't do that. What's the deal? I'm used to 2012 cars and below, did something new come out? \\nAdding on to this video though, I am wondering if switching to neutral is a better bet for a emergency braking maneuver. My car buckles after slowing below 10mph, I assume it is a CVT thing, but, I only really drive manuals, so, please correct me if I am wrong.",0,0

_bZlb62VVlw,Thanks for the video I no longer coast downhill. Coming back to your scenario it would probably be more efficient even if there are not a series of his but flat straight road as the momentum built by coasting can be used to cover some distance as long as you don't exceed the safe speed for that road.,0,0
_bZlb62VVlw,"So in in real life (unless you happens to be alone on the road, you don't care about safety or breaking the law; or it's the German Autobahn) you really should always keep it in gear.\\n\\nBtw this is yet another demonstration of why MPG (i.e. unit of distance / unit of energy) is a bad metric for efficiency, since when the consumption is 0 you end up dividing by zero and the display has to show a nonsense max value. If instead you use the more reasonable measure of unit of energy / unit of distance (e.g. gallons per mile or liters/100 km or kWh/100 km, etc.) when the usage is zero the meter can show simply 0, and the scale is more linear as well.",0,0

_bZlb62VVlw,"A caveat here: Fueling GENERALLY only cuts in the top 2/3 of the rev range. In the bottom 1/3, fueling will cut back on, which is why you'll get some gurgles towards the bottom of the rev range. So if you leave in high gear, you won't see as big a difference as when by putting it in a lower gear. Which also means you need to underline rev matching. Rev matching uses fuel. WAY more than you're going to save. So you'd have to granny shift it to see any benefit. Granny shifts wear out your trans. Transmissions are way more expensive than gasoline. But the easiest thing of all to replace (besides gasoline) is the brake pads. So you kinda have to decide what your maintenance strategy is and go with it.",0,0

_bZlb62VVlw,"There's engine drag, and there's power... both is a function of RPM. Power is high when RPM is high and when fuel throttle is open, this relationship is because power is merely the frequency of combustion and this frequency is function of RPM or how fast the engine cycle its stroke... so high RPM = high power,  but there's a negative aspect of high RPM; the engine drag is highest when RPM is high, because the rapid stroke cycle meant that the engine component is moving and grinding at high rate thus creating high friction loss. So, if your fuel throttle is close but your RPM is high, then you got zero power and you are left with engine braking (which is from engine friction & thermodynamic losses during intake air compression).",0,0

For example,  you can have your car in a high gear with low rpms and slam on the gas but it won't accelerate much faster, or you can have your car in low gear at high rpms and just slightly hit the gas and it will accelerate very quickly. So which instance would use more fuel?",1,0
_bZlb62VVlw,Great vid and explanation. You should do a vid debunking the myth of engine compression braking and show how the engine really has very low compression with throttle plate closed and coasting. Perhaps get into pumping losses and why cylinder deactivation works by opening the throttle further but indeed still uses the same amount of fuel at the same rpm as if it was running all the cylinders.

_bZlb62VVlw,"My rule of thumb: if I need to touch the brakes when descending a grade, I should be leaving it in gear. If I want more speed, neutral/pressing clutch pedal might be worth it. In general, speed limits cause me to leave it in gear most of the time. \\n\\nAnother thing to consider is what gear you engine brake in. Once engine speed falls below ~1500 RPM, the injectors will turn on, even if you have the car in gear. For example, if you left the car in 5th gear while slowing to make a turn, after you go below ~40 km/h (25 mph), the engine will start using fuel and fight your braking. If you coasted down in 3rd instead of 5th, this wouldn't happen until ~16 km/h (10 mph).",0,0

HzzmqUoQobc,"Why has civilization completely forgotten the music of Beethoven, and Bach? How can we celebrate repetition for repetitions sake, when truly transcendent music is possible? I'm speaking of the extremely wide range of harmony that something called chord progressions, and dominant fifths, and many other techniques make possible in humanities understanding of music.  Most music in my opinion is like wall-paper for the mind. Some songs I will admit have the power to transform through lyrics, and other musical elements.  However,  there is a difference between the subjective and the objective. Popular music enhances a subjective interpretation, or feeling. Good classical music coaxes your personality into transformation.  If you just listen to a piece maybe beethoven piano sonata 14, and listen to the whole thing, you can hear how the experience represents a journey.  Starting from a state of depression, to over coming depression, to self-actualization in the 3rd movement.  When I heard this for the first time I realized the fallacy of the modern state of music.  We exalt the repetitious form, and disregard the exploration of new forms that transform the mind.  We push out 4-5 minute poems with a beat, and call it music.  This is disrespectful to the enormous amount of effort that countless human beings have put forth towards the progress of musical form. We reached such a great place with tonality and exploring tonality itself. We did not run out of ideas, so what happened? It was so difficult to be a great composer that eventually we have forgotten how to teach the deep understanding of the form itself!

HzzmqUoQobc,"The rise of digital recording and editing is the enabler of increased lyrical and rhythmic repetition, particularly in pop music. The final mixes we hear are rarely a singer's or composer's organic vision of a music creation, but rather a producer's translation. With all the parts and pieces available to arrange and rearrange once the recording is done, the guys behind the console can craft all the repetition they want. Typically these are the same people who make their living selling the songs, and they have long been aware of our musical mind's tendency to sync with repetition, given the opportunity.",0,0

You should be able to stand still - maybe feel a little backwards wobble.\\n\\nNow take the same box and fill the paper back in. Same size box - just much heavier. Repeat experiment and you can not stand still as you throw the box but need to take a step backwards as it pushes you away. If air had anything to do with this - the experiment should yield the same results as the exterior of the box was the same.

_bZlb62VVlw,"Important Note: This video applies to *modern cars with electronic fuel injection* (gas, diesel, manual, automatic, DCT, CVT, etc). New cars sold today will all work like this (though there are always random exceptions). As you go back in model years, it will vary manufacturer to manufacturer which completely shut off fuel or continue to inject. Carbureted vehicles inject fuel based on vacuum levels of your engine, so this video does not apply. Sometimes I take pictures: https://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained/",157,46

_bZlb62VVlw,Will ramming an engine charge a car that you're jump-starting faster??.. please explain in details I've been dying to know this.,0,0
_bZlb62VVlw,"WRONG. The injectors are *NOT* shut off when you close the throttle. That would damage the engine and be dangerous from a control standpoint. There is fuel going to the cylinders, but it's only enough for an idle. There will be slightly more fuel injected with engine braking because of the higher rpm. The reason the computer goes to 99 or whatever your particular car's max is is because the method used to calculate the fuel economy is just an estimate, and as the number goes up the accuracy goes down. The amount of fuel being injected is relatively miniscule, so of course the economy goes up, but it is also impossible to measure accurately with the method that the car's computer and hardware uses. The first cars to have an mpg display were wildly inaccurate. They have gotten a lot better, but if you religiously calculate your fuel economy manually you will find that the car's estimate is not totally accurate and is better under some conditions than others.\\n\\nTo answer this question accurately would require actual scientific testing with equipment not available on any production car.\\n\\nAlso, the assumption should not be that you are coming to a stop at the bottom, but that you are going to be maintaining the speed limit from that point on.\\n\\nThen there is the question of whether the incline is enough to make you speed up, stay at a constant speed, or slow down when coasting. For purposes of this discussion, it's reasonable to assume only the case where you will pick up speed if coasting.\\n\\nThat said, some educated guesses can be made. Coasting in neutral, the engine is idling. Using engine braking, the engine is also idling, but at a faster RPM, so it is using slightly more fuel, but whether it is measureably more in a real-world situation is uncertain. However, if you are using engine braking, you are converting potential energy into heat by compressing air, rather than your brakes, which is essentially the same thing as using your brakes but much easier on your brakes and pads. Coasting, on the other hand, converts potential energy into kinetic energy, which can be either converted directly back into potential energy by climbing the next hill or simply used instead of fuel to overcome friction and drag for a while if you're coming onto a flat.\\n\\nSo the answer is that coasting is more efficient, but unless the road is very straight it would be dangerous because of the increase in speed, and you will definitely break the speed limit. Engine braking is less efficient but safer and less likely to put points on your driving record, and the difference in efficiency is not as great as the difference in safety and legality.\\n\\nThis issue is particularly interesting with regard to electric vehicles that use regenerative braking (one-pedal driving). In city driving, regen is a good thing because it saves brakes and increases range, but only because that is under conditions when you need to reduce speed relatively quickly and otherwise you would be repeatedly just throwing huge amounts of kinetic energy away in the form of heat. On highway hills, though, regen isn't as efficient and can cause problems with heat accumulation in the battery and control system. But again, sometimes efficiency has to take a back seat to more important considerations. An added issue is that if you start out at the top of the hill with a full battery, regenerative braking isn't possible without damaging your battery.",0,0

_bZlb62VVlw,"I have to disagree with you on this assessment. I have a 2012 Subaru Impreza, so my MPG display is exactly the same as yours. Also manual transmission. When cruising, engine braking will start to drop MPG from 99.9 before it will in neutral (i.e., at low speeds, active MPG will still show 99.9 in neutral while engine braking at the same speed will be lower). I think fuel expenditure when your foot is OFF the gas will be the SAME, whether in neutral or engine braking - but neutral will take you further and therefore is more efficient for the same distance traveled. I don't think the car computer is smart enough to measure true MPG. It simply performs a simple calculation based on a function of your speed and your RPM. When you're in neutral, the engine has to keep running, it can't just stop (unless it is a hybrid, which it isn't), so it will consume just enough fuel to keep itself running at low RPM, hence the 99.9. During engine braking, the engine can't just stop combusting (which it would have to do if it were consuming zero fuel as you assert). It is still burning the same amount of fuel as at idle, but the engine braking pushes the RPM higher. The car computer interprets that as higher RPM per speed and therefore spits out a lower MPG. In other words, coasting in neutral is always more efficient in terms of gas (although not in terms of brake pad wear).",0,0

_bZlb62VVlw,"Related but slightly off topic question - inbetween a gear shift with the clutch depressed but BEFORE I have moved the gear lever to the desired gear, say 3rd for example, is the throttle in any way linked to the transmission?

A couple of times selecting third in particular I've pressed the clutch, applied throttle before I've pushed the stick into 3rd and it's felt like the stick has jumped back at me like the gears rejected the synchro because the shafts began to spin up again (my best guess). If I do not apply throttle during shifts i do not get this sensation, all shifts slot in nicely. When this is all happening the clutch is firmly depressed all the way down, fully disengaged.",0,0

And even if you could break, this will reduce dramatically their life spawn, so in practical results everything you save from gas you will easily waste maintaining your brakes.

_bZlb62VVlw,Yes but coasting is more fun :-)\nAnother tip is in a hybrid or electric car never use the brakes in N cause then you're not regenerating.,0,0
_bZlb62VVlw,Good fantastic advise.\nBut Coasting in neutral is dangerous and you won't be in control of the car.,0,0
_bZlb62VVlw,"What about transmition and engine wear? I guess if you downhill in gear, the wear will be higher. What you save in fuel will compensate a possible transmition/engine repair?",0,0
_bZlb62VVlw,Recent BMW's have the coast or sail feature when you are in ECO PRO mode.  This basically bumps the auto into neutral when you lift off the throttle.  Around town I find it's not a big saver but on a recent mountainous road trip it dropped my average l/100km usage over the trip by about 10-20% while still averaging a speed of ~100km/h over the entire trip.,0,0

_bZlb62VVlw,"W R O N G !\\nFor an efficiency excercise, switch off the engine!\\nAt my last job, the journey each way was give or take, ten miles each way. Each day i was able to coast with the engine off for a good four miles thanks to the terrain of dual carriageway with long hills.\\nOn the way back i could accelerate up to 80mph and coast all the way down to the main roundabout which was just over a mile and a half and then if all was clear, take the roundabout at around fifty and then coast a further three quarters of a mile to the first set of traffic lights along the flat.\\nMy mpg went up considerably driving this way :)",0,0
_bZlb62VVlw,"You don't need a hill to go up, a long stretch of flat road will make neutral more efficient too.",0,0
_bZlb62VVlw,You're in a Subaru and do a video on down hill but don't mention automatics have L mode.,0,0
_bZlb62VVlw,Great vid and explanation. You should do a vid debunking the myth of engine compression braking and show how the engine really has very low compression with throttle plate closed and coasting. Perhaps get into pumping losses and why cylinder deactivation works by opening the throttle further but indeed still uses the same amount of fuel at the same rpm as if it was running all the cylinders. Might be a good topic :)\n-Eric O.,5,1

I would totally recommend still checking and 24 hours before hand, even if you were checking in a bag!  You can usually pay for your baggage fees online and there‚Äôs usually a backdrop line. So that even though you have a bag to check in, you are already checked in and you paid your fees.  It‚Äôs a lot quicker of a  line to drop off a bag when you‚Äôve checked in already. You also get to pick your seat 24 hours before hand, if you wait to check in until you get to the airport there are a lot less choices for seats and some airlines that overbook flights will bump the last people that checked in.",0,1

_bZlb62VVlw,"Important Note: This video applies to *modern cars with electronic fuel injection* (gas, diesel, manual, automatic, DCT, CVT, etc). New cars sold today will all work like this (though there are always random exceptions). As you go back in model years, it will vary manufacturer to manufacturer which completely shut off fuel or continue to inject. Carbureted vehicles inject fuel based on vacuum levels of your engine, so this video does not apply. Sometimes I take pictures: https://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained/",168,50

_bZlb62VVlw,Will ramming an engine charge a car that you're jump-starting faster??.. please explain in details I've been dying to know this.,0,0
_bZlb62VVlw,"WRONG. The injectors are *NOT* shut off when you close the throttle. That would damage the engine and be dangerous from a control standpoint. There is fuel going to the cylinders, but it's only enough for an idle. There will be slightly more fuel injected with engine braking because of the higher rpm. The reason the computer goes to 99 or whatever your particular car's max is is because the method used to calculate the fuel economy is just an estimate, and as the number goes up the accuracy goes down. The amount of fuel being injected is relatively miniscule, so of course the economy goes up, but it is also impossible to measure accurately with the method that the car's computer and hardware uses. The first cars to have an mpg display were wildly inaccurate. They have gotten a lot better, but if you religiously calculate your fuel economy manually you will find that the car's estimate is not totally accurate and is better under some conditions than others.\\n\\nTo answer this question accurately would require actual scientific testing with equipment not available on any production car.\\n\\nAlso, the assumption should not be that you are coming to a stop at the bottom, but that you are going to be maintaining the speed limit from that point on.\\n\\nThen there is the question of whether the incline is enough to make you speed up, stay at a constant speed, or slow down when coasting. For purposes of this discussion, it's reasonable to assume only the case where you will pick up speed if coasting.\\n\\nThat said, some educated guesses can be made. Coasting in neutral, the engine is idling. Using engine braking, the engine is also idling, but at a faster RPM, so it is using slightly more fuel, but whether it is measureably more in a real-world situation is uncertain. However, if you are using engine braking, you are converting potential energy into heat by compressing air, rather than your brakes, which is essentially the same thing as using your brakes but much easier on your brakes and pads. Coasting, on the other hand, converts potential energy into kinetic energy, which can be either converted directly back into potential energy by climbing the next hill or simply used instead of fuel to overcome friction and drag for a while if you're coming onto a flat.\\n\\nSo the answer is that coasting is more efficient, but unless the road is very straight it would be dangerous because of the increase in speed, and you will definitely break the speed limit. Engine braking is less efficient but safer and less likely to put points on your driving record, and the difference in efficiency is not as great as the difference in safety and legality.\\n\\nThis issue is particularly interesting with regard to electric vehicles that use regenerative braking (one-pedal driving). In city driving, regen is a good thing because it saves brakes and increases range, but only because that is under conditions when you need to reduce speed relatively quickly and otherwise you would be repeatedly just throwing huge amounts of kinetic energy away in the form of heat. On highway hills, though, regen isn't as efficient and can cause problems with heat accumulation in the battery and control system. But again, sometimes efficiency has to take a back seat to more important considerations. An added issue is that if you start out at the top of the hill with a full battery, regenerative braking isn't possible without damaging your battery.",0,0

A couple of times selecting third in particular I've pressed the clutch, applied throttle before I've pushed the stick into 3rd and it's felt like the stick has jumped back at me like the gears rejected the synchro because the shafts began to spin up again (my best guess). If I do not apply throttle during shifts i do not get this sensation, all shifts slot in nicely. When this is all happening the clutch is firmly depressed all the way down, fully disengaged.",0,0

_bZlb62VVlw,"Hipoteticaly, coast in neutral in downhills would save tons of gas because of the inertia, but a detached engine would be really hard to stop the vehicle without the engine breaking, the wheels breaking are not enough to hold all the weight of the car by itself, putting extra effort on the safety conditions of normal use, so they will fade really fast and again you put in enormous risk.

_bZlb62VVlw,"I have to disagree with you on this assessment. I have a 2012 Subaru Impreza, so my MPG display is exactly the same as yours. Also manual transmission. When cruising, engine braking will start to drop MPG from 99.9 before it will in neutral (i.e., at low speeds, active MPG will still show 99.9 in neutral while engine braking at the same speed will be lower). I think fuel expenditure when your foot is OFF the gas will be the SAME, whether in neutral or engine braking - but neutral will take you further and therefore is more efficient for the same distance traveled. I don't think the car computer is smart enough to measure true MPG. It simply performs a simple calculation based on a function of your speed and your RPM. When you're in neutral, the engine has to keep running, it can't just stop (unless it is a hybrid, which it isn't), so it will consume just enough fuel to keep itself running at low RPM, hence the 99.9. During engine braking, the engine can't just stop combusting (which it would have to do if it were consuming zero fuel as you assert). It is still burning the same amount of fuel as at idle, but the engine braking pushes the RPM higher. The car computer interprets that as higher RPM per speed and therefore spits out a lower MPG. In other words, coasting in neutral is always more efficient in terms of gas (although not in terms of brake pad wear).",0,0

So if you leave in high gear, you won't see as big a difference as when by putting it in a lower gear. Which also means you need to underline rev matching. Rev matching uses fuel. WAY more than you're going to save. So you'd have to granny shift it to see any benefit. Granny shifts wear out your trans. Transmissions are way more expensive than gasoline.

But given that Now Playing must be inherently listening all the time given that Now Playing doesn't have an activation phrase and the whole point is that you can just pickup your phone to know who's playing without doing anything.

_bZlb62VVlw,"Important Note: This video applies to *modern cars with electronic fuel injection* (gas, diesel, manual, automatic, DCT, CVT, etc). New cars sold today will all work like this (though there are always random exceptions). As you go back in model years, it will vary manufacturer to manufacturer which completely shut off fuel or continue to inject. Carbureted vehicles inject fuel based on vacuum levels of your engine, so this video does not apply. Sometimes I take pictures: https://www.instagram.com/engineeringexplained/",175,51
_bZlb62VVlw,What happens in carbureted engines?,0,0

_bZlb62VVlw,So living in the mountains I have always used lower gears and engine braking to slow myself downhill to reduce wear on brakes.  Always have learned this is just how you drive but recently started hearing people argue that point saying it is better to constantly hit the brakes going downhill because new brake pads are cheaper than the wear the engine is getting.  Does engine braking or simply using low gear going downhill harm the engine that bad that wasting brake pads is the better option?,0,0

_bZlb62VVlw,I just love how you answer questions I didn't even know I wanted answered,0,0
_bZlb62VVlw,Great vid and explanation. You should do a vid debunking the myth of engine compression braking and show how the engine really has very low compression with throttle plate closed and coasting. Perhaps get into pumping losses and why cylinder deactivation works by opening the throttle further but indeed still uses the same amount of fuel at the same rpm as if it was running all the cylinders. Might be a good topic :)\n-Eric O.,9,3

_bZlb62VVlw,"Why, you ask, does the car use no gas while coasting in gear?¬† Because the throttle has a switch to tell the ECU that your foot is off the gas. Simple.¬† Some cars have a switch at the top as well (a 'kick-down switch') that tells the transmission to shift down (within limits) for faster acceleration.¬† Gas is turned back on when the engine speed is below a certain level (my car,¬†1400 rpm) to keep it running when you are in fact sitting at a light in neutral.¬† In my car, the ECU doesn't measure road speed or transmission gear or clutch pedal variables, it only works on engine speed.¬† It's an '86.",0,0
_bZlb62VVlw,"Also, do not use engine breaking in an old two-stroke vehicle. The RPM is much higher and the engine does not get enough lubricant and you can seriously damage it. Of course, such vehicles are hard to see on the streets anymore, practiacally impossible out of classic car shows.",0,0

_bZlb62VVlw,"WRONG. The injectors are *NOT* shut off when you close the throttle. That would damage the engine and be dangerous from a control standpoint. There is fuel going to the cylinders, but it's only enough for an idle. There will be slightly more fuel injected with engine braking because of the higher rpm. The reason the computer goes to 99 or whatever your particular car's max is is because the method used to calculate the fuel economy is just an estimate, and as the number goes up the accuracy goes down. The amount of fuel being injected is relatively miniscule, so of course the economy goes up, but it is also impossible to measure accurately with the method that the car's computer and hardware uses. The first cars to have an mpg display were wildly inaccurate. They have gotten a lot better, but if you religiously calculate your fuel economy manually you will find that the car's estimate is not totally accurate and is better under some conditions than others.\\n\\nTo answer this question accurately would require actual scientific testing with equipment not available on any production car.\\n\\nAlso, the assumption should not be that you are coming to a stop at the bottom, but that you are going to be maintaining the speed limit from that point on.\\n\\nThen there is the question of whether the incline is enough to make you speed up, stay at a constant speed, or slow down when coasting. For purposes of this discussion, it's reasonable to assume only the case where you will pick up speed if coasting.\\n\\nThat said, some educated guesses can be made. Coasting in neutral, the engine is idling. Using engine braking, the engine is also idling, but at a faster RPM, so it is using slightly more fuel, but whether it is measureably more in a real-world situation is uncertain. However, if you are using engine braking, you are converting potential energy into heat by compressing air, rather than your brakes, which is essentially the same thing as using your brakes but much easier on your brakes and pads. Coasting, on the other hand, converts potential energy into kinetic energy, which can be either converted directly back into potential energy by climbing the next hill or simply used instead of fuel to overcome friction and drag for a while if you're coming onto a flat.\\n\\nSo the answer is that coasting is more efficient, but unless the road is very straight it would be dangerous because of the increase in speed, and you will definitely break the speed limit. Engine braking is less efficient but safer and less likely to put points on your driving record, and the difference in efficiency is not as great as the difference in safety and legality.\\n\\nThis issue is particularly interesting with regard to electric vehicles that use regenerative braking (one-pedal driving). In city driving, regen is a good thing because it saves brakes and increases range, but only because that is under conditions when you need to reduce speed relatively quickly and otherwise you would be repeatedly just throwing huge amounts of kinetic energy away in the form of heat. On highway hills, though, regen isn't as efficient and can cause problems with heat accumulation in the battery and control system. But again, sometimes efficiency has to take a back seat to more important considerations. An added issue is that if you start out at the top of the hill with a full battery, regenerative braking isn't possible without damaging your battery.",0,0

Only issue that would arise is if someone pulled out in front of me and I had to slow down, then I'd have to start the car again.  Even without power, you can still hit the brakes hard enough to lock the wheels if you really stand on the pedal, otherwise I'd have considered it too unsafe.

_bZlb62VVlw,"Related but slightly off topic question - inbetween a gear shift with the clutch depressed but BEFORE I have moved the gear lever to the desired gear, say 3rd for example, is the throttle in any way linked to the transmission? My car drops revs like crazy, I have to shift very quickly to catch the revs before they've dropped too low for the next gear to have a smooth engagement so on up shifts I tend to hold the throttle lightly to maintain revs at the correct level, but I tend to do this whilst the clutch is down and I'm mid selecting a new gear. A couple of times selecting third in particular I've pressed the clutch, applied throttle before I've pushed the stick into 3rd and it's felt like the stick has jumped back at me like the gears rejected the synchro because the shafts began to spin up again (my best guess). If I do not apply throttle during shifts i do not get this sensation, all shifts slot in nicely. When this is all happening the clutch is firmly depressed all the way down, fully disengaged.",0,0

_bZlb62VVlw,"Hipoteticaly, coast in neutral in downhills would save tons of gas because of the inertia, but a detached engine would be really hard to stop the vehicle without the engine breaking, the wheels breaking are not enough to hold all the weight of the car by itself, putting extra effort on the safety conditions of normal use, so they will fade really fast and again you put in enormous risk. And even if you could break, this will reduce dramatically their life spawn, so in practical results everything you save from gas you will easily waste maintaining your brakes. I know that because I tested this several times. I live next to a highway about 800m above the see and work in a city 1100m above the sea, so my way back home is an 40m downhill freeway.

_bZlb62VVlw,"I have to disagree with you on this assessment. I have a 2012 Subaru Impreza, so my MPG display is exactly the same as yours. Also manual transmission. When cruising, engine braking will start to drop MPG from 99.9 before it will in neutral (i.e., at low speeds, active MPG will still show 99.9 in neutral while engine braking at the same speed will be lower). I think fuel expenditure when your foot is OFF the gas will be the SAME, whether in neutral or engine braking - but neutral will take you further and therefore is more efficient for the same distance traveled. I don't think the car computer is smart enough to measure true MPG. It simply performs a simple calculation based on a function of your speed and your RPM. When you're in neutral, the engine has to keep running, it can't just stop (unless it is a hybrid, which it isn't), so it will consume just enough fuel to keep itself running at low RPM, hence the 99.9. During engine braking, the engine can't just stop combusting (which it would have to do if it were consuming zero fuel as you assert). It is still burning the same amount of fuel as at idle, but the engine braking pushes the RPM higher. The car computer interprets that as higher RPM per speed and therefore spits out a lower MPG. In other words, coasting in neutral is always more efficient in terms of gas (although not in terms of brake pad wear).",0,0

_bZlb62VVlw,Thanks for the video I no longer coast downhill.

_bZlb62VVlw,"A caveat here: Fueling GENERALLY only cuts in the top 2/3 of the rev range.

So if you leave in high gear, you won't see as big a difference as when by putting it in a lower gear. Which also means you need to underline rev matching. Rev matching uses fuel. WAY more than you're going to save. So you'd have to granny shift it to see any benefit. Granny shifts wear out your trans. Transmissions are way more expensive than gasoline.

a-9IZz8Ry5I,"The headphone jack would be a big deal if there were not already usb-c earphones, but there are and I'm sure they can deliver equal or even better quality than 3.5 mm jack. Wireless charging? Really? You can't even move your phone while using it, it's totally useless (not to mention slow). When we're able to walk around our room while charging it wirelessly, THAT will be awesome. When manufactures started removing SD card slots I thought it wasn't ok, but now I think it's better to run your stuff (specially apps) from the phone as they start faster, and transfering your files will take just seconds through usb-c so no big deal. Though everybody is praising it, I'm still skeptical about one camera being better than two, as zoom and focusing are (in my opinion) always better achieved with optical features rather than software processing (does anybody know how wide is the angle btw?). It's said that the screen looks very poor, specially for people like me who are used to those oversaturated Samsung screens. Google says they've tried to make it look as natural as possible which seems good for pictures (I hated when I checked my phone's photos on PC and they looked totally different, very low contrast and not that vibrantly colorful), but this is definitely a bad score for video watching and gaming, so I really hope they can fix it through a software update and get both colorful and natural display. And about design...they definitely could've done better. Galaxy S8 and iPhone X win here by far, but I prioritize functionality over looks and always use a case anyway. Hopefully I can get the Pixel 2 XL soon and make a (neutral) review myself about it!",0,0

_bZlb62VVlw,Will ramming an engine charge a car that you're jump-starting faster??.. please explain in details I've been dying to know this.,0,0
_bZlb62VVlw,"WRONG. The injectors are *NOT* shut off when you close the throttle. That would damage the engine and be dangerous from a control standpoint. There is fuel going to the cylinders, but it's only enough for an idle. There will be slightly more fuel injected with engine braking because of the higher rpm. The reason the computer goes to 99 or whatever your particular car's max is is because the method used to calculate the fuel economy is just an estimate, and as the number goes up the accuracy goes down. The amount of fuel being injected is relatively miniscule, so of course the economy goes up, but it is also impossible to measure accurately with the method that the car's computer and hardware uses. The first cars to have an mpg display were wildly inaccurate. They have gotten a lot better, but if you religiously calculate your fuel economy manually you will find that the car's estimate is not totally accurate and is better under some conditions than others.\\n\\nTo answer this question accurately would require actual scientific testing with equipment not available on any production car.\\n\\nAlso, the assumption should not be that you are coming to a stop at the bottom, but that you are going to be maintaining the speed limit from that point on.\\n\\nThen there is the question of whether the incline is enough to make you speed up, stay at a constant speed, or slow down when coasting. For purposes of this discussion, it's reasonable to assume only the case where you will pick up speed if coasting.\\n\\nThat said, some educated guesses can be made. Coasting in neutral, the engine is idling. Using engine braking, the engine is also idling, but at a faster RPM, so it is using slightly more fuel, but whether it is measureably more in a real-world situation is uncertain. However, if you are using engine braking, you are converting potential energy into heat by compressing air, rather than your brakes, which is essentially the same thing as using your brakes but much easier on your brakes and pads. Coasting, on the other hand, converts potential energy into kinetic energy, which can be either converted directly back into potential energy by climbing the next hill or simply used instead of fuel to overcome friction and drag for a while if you're coming onto a flat.\\n\\nSo the answer is that coasting is more efficient, but unless the road is very straight it would be dangerous because of the increase in speed, and you will definitely break the speed limit. Engine braking is less efficient but safer and less likely to put points on your driving record, and the difference in efficiency is not as great as the difference in safety and legality.\\n\\nThis issue is particularly interesting with regard to electric vehicles that use regenerative braking (one-pedal driving). In city driving, regen is a good thing because it saves brakes and increases range, but only because that is under conditions when you need to reduce speed relatively quickly and otherwise you would be repeatedly just throwing huge amounts of kinetic energy away in the form of heat. On highway hills, though, regen isn't as efficient and can cause problems with heat accumulation in the battery and control system. But again, sometimes efficiency has to take a back seat to more important considerations. An added issue is that if you start out at the top of the hill with a full battery, regenerative braking isn't possible without damaging your battery.",0,0

Only issue that would arise is if someone pulled out in front of me and I had to slow down, then I'd have to start the car again.  Even without power, you can still hit the brakes hard enough to lock the wheels if you really stand on the pedal, otherwise I'd have considered it too unsafe.

_bZlb62VVlw,"Related but slightly off topic question - inbetween a gear shift with the clutch depressed but BEFORE I have moved the gear lever to the desired gear, say 3rd for example, is the throttle in any way linked to the transmission? My car drops revs like crazy, I have to shift very quickly to catch the revs before they've dropped too low for the next gear to have a smooth engagement so on up shifts I tend to hold the throttle lightly to maintain revs at the correct level, but I tend to do this whilst the clutch is down and I'm mid selecting a new gear. A couple of times selecting third in particular I've pressed the clutch, applied throttle before I've pushed the stick into 3rd and it's felt like the stick has jumped back at me like the gears rejected the synchro because the shafts began to spin up again (my best guess). If I do not apply throttle during shifts i do not get this sensation, all shifts slot in nicely. When this is all happening the clutch is firmly depressed all the way down, fully disengaged.",0,0

_bZlb62VVlw,"Hipoteticaly, coast in neutral in downhills would save tons of gas because of the inertia, but a detached engine would be really hard to stop the vehicle without the engine breaking, the wheels breaking are not enough to hold all the weight of the car by itself, putting extra effort on the safety conditions of normal use, so they will fade really fast and again you put in enormous risk. And even if you could break, this will reduce dramatically their life spawn, so in practical results everything you save from gas you will easily waste maintaining your brakes. I know that because I tested this several times. I live next to a highway about 800m above the see and work in a city 1100m above the sea, so my way back home is an 40m downhill freeway.

_bZlb62VVlw,"Question: engine braking in 3rd gear vs engine braking in 5th gear - no gas is used, but in 5th gear you don't lose your speed that much right?",0,0
_bZlb62VVlw,"I have to disagree with you on this assessment. I have a 2012 Subaru Impreza, so my MPG display is exactly the same as yours. Also manual transmission. When cruising, engine braking will start to drop MPG from 99.9 before it will in neutral (i.e., at low speeds, active MPG will still show 99.9 in neutral while engine braking at the same speed will be lower). I think fuel expenditure when your foot is OFF the gas will be the SAME, whether in neutral or engine braking - but neutral will take you further and therefore is more efficient for the same distance traveled. I don't think the car computer is smart enough to measure true MPG. It simply performs a simple calculation based on a function of your speed and your RPM. When you're in neutral, the engine has to keep running, it can't just stop (unless it is a hybrid, which it isn't), so it will consume just enough fuel to keep itself running at low RPM, hence the 99.9. During engine braking, the engine can't just stop combusting (which it would have to do if it were consuming zero fuel as you assert). It is still burning the same amount of fuel as at idle, but the engine braking pushes the RPM higher. The car computer interprets that as higher RPM per speed and therefore spits out a lower MPG. In other words, coasting in neutral is always more efficient in terms of gas (although not in terms of brake pad wear).",0,0
_bZlb62VVlw,"Hey Jason, this has bugged me since I bought my brand new Nissan Altima. When I turn on the AC, my rpms are set dead at 750. In fact, that's the normal idle at all times, and it confuses me a bit. I thought, at least, the AC would make it churn more rpms, but this car doesn't do that. What's the deal? I'm used to 2012 cars and below, did something new come out? \\nAdding on to this video though, I am wondering if switching to neutral is a better bet for a emergency braking maneuver. My car buckles after slowing below 10mph, I assume it is a CVT thing, but, I only really drive manuals, so, please correct me if I am wrong.",0,0
_bZlb62VVlw,"Nice explanation.\\nSo basically if you have hill to climb after the down-slope, then put it in neutral. Otherwise, use engine braking.",0,0

_bZlb62VVlw,"Assuming a similar concept would work with an electric vehicle, except engine braking would be replaced with regen braking",0,0
_bZlb62VVlw,Thanks for the video I no longer coast downhill. Coming back to your scenario it would probably be more efficient even if there are not a series of his but flat straight road as the momentum built by coasting can be used to cover some distance as long as you don't exceed the safe speed for that road.,0,0
_bZlb62VVlw,"So in in real life (unless you happens to be alone on the road, you don't care about safety or breaking the law; or it's the German Autobahn) you really should always keep it in gear.\\n\\nBtw this is yet another demonstration of why MPG (i.e. unit of distance / unit of energy) is a bad metric for efficiency, since when the consumption is 0 you end up dividing by zero and the display has to show a nonsense max value. If instead you use the more reasonable measure of unit of energy / unit of distance (e.g. gallons per mile or liters/100 km or kWh/100 km, etc.) when the usage is zero the meter can show simply 0, and the scale is more linear as well.",0,0

_bZlb62VVlw,"A caveat here: Fueling GENERALLY only cuts in the top 2/3 of the rev range. In the bottom 1/3, fueling will cut back on, which is why you'll get some gurgles towards the bottom of the rev range. So if you leave in high gear, you won't see as big a difference as when by putting it in a lower gear. Which also means you need to underline rev matching. Rev matching uses fuel. WAY more than you're going to save. So you'd have to granny shift it to see any benefit. Granny shifts wear out your trans. Transmissions are way more expensive than gasoline. But the easiest thing of all to replace (besides gasoline) is the brake pads. So you kinda have to decide what your maintenance strategy is and go with it.",0,0

_bZlb62VVlw,Great vid and explanation. You should do a vid debunking the myth of engine compression braking and show how the engine really has very low compression with throttle plate closed and coasting. Perhaps get into pumping losses and why cylinder deactivation works by opening the throttle further but indeed still uses the same amount of fuel at the same rpm as if it was running all the cylinders.

a-9IZz8Ry5I,"The headphone jack would be a big deal if there were not already usb-c earphones, but there are and I'm sure they can deliver equal or even better quality than 3.5 mm jack. Wireless charging? Really? You can't even move your phone while using it, it's totally useless (not to mention slow). When we're able to walk around our room while charging it wirelessly, THAT will be awesome. When manufactures started removing SD card slots I thought it wasn't ok, but now I think it's better to run your stuff (specially apps) from the phone as they start faster, and transfering your files will take just seconds through usb-c so no big deal. Though everybody is praising it, I'm still skeptical about one camera being better than two, as zoom and focusing are (in my opinion) always better achieved with optical features rather than software processing (does anybody know how wide is the angle btw?). It's said that the screen looks very poor, specially for people like me who are used to those oversaturated Samsung screens. Google says they've tried to make it look as natural as possible which seems good for pictures (I hated when I checked my phone's photos on PC and they looked totally different, very low contrast and not that vibrantly colorful), but this is definitely a bad score for video watching and gaming, so I really hope they can fix it through a software update and get both colorful and natural display. And about design...they definitely could've done better. Galaxy S8 and iPhone X win here by far, but I prioritize functionality over looks and always use a case anyway. Hopefully I can get the Pixel 2 XL soon and make a (neutral) review myself about it!",0,0
