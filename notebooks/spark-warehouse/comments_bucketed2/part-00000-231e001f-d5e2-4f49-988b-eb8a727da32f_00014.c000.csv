UCrBICYM0yM,"How can people be excited about this crap? This makes absolutelly NO sense at all. First: Most catastrophes are not caused by overpopulation, but natural disasters. Even if you make the point of carrying capacity in terms of food becoming a problem, it could be tackled by GMOs easier and better. Second: You CAN NOT just shrink people down like this. The size of nucleons are unalterable, because the ranges of the strong and weak nuclear forces are fundamental constants. Reducing the space between nuclei and electrons is impossible because of electromagnetism. And even packing molecules tighter together wouldn't work, as there'd be biochemical problems. Correct protein folding and therefore enzymes would be rendered impossible. Third: How could they metabolize food and drinks not their own size? Their tiny enzymes wouldn't work on normal-sized molecules. I'd say if you can alter the fundamental universal constants, carrying capacity is no worry any longer, you're basically beyond even a kardashev III civilization by then. \\n\\nThis isn't even original, as some say. The shrinking trope has been done to death!\\nAnd before someone points out this is supposed to be a comedy: Even a comedy needs suspension of disbelief. Also, it may be because I hate Hollywood comedy to the death, but at least for me they're always the same. Clichee-filled crude humor fests with plots of idiocy. And this looks exactly like that.",0,0

(His name was JESUS!!!)......\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n(Christ Witnesses to Nicodemus on the reason why people want to stay in their sins and not accept him as their Lord and savior and as believers, you have to produce works to show that you have saving faith in God. (Matthew 3:8)<---Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.):\\n\\nAnd this is the condemnation,\\nthat light is come into the world,\\nand men loved darkness rather than light,\\nbecause their deeds were evil.\\n\\n(Condemnation): Refers to the reason for judgment. The light referred to here is Jesus, the light of the world).\\n\\nFor every one that doeth evil \\nhateth the light,\\nneither cometh to the light, \\nlest his deeds should be exposed.\\n\\n(People offer many excuses for not accepting Christ. Some cite the presence of hypocrites in the church. Others claim inability to believe some of the truths about Christ or the gospel. These are merely attempts to conceal a heart in rebellion against God. The ultimate reason people do not come to Christ is that they do not want to).\\n\\nBut he that doeth truth \\ncometh to the light, \\nthat his deeds may be made manifest, \\nthat they are done in God.\\n\\n(The one who does the truth, (1 John 1:5)<---This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all), is obviously, already a believer because his or her deeds are done in God. Therefore, coming to the light is more than exercising faith. A person who comes to the light not only believes, but also openly identifies with the light so that his or her works can be seen as things done in union with God. (Jame 2:14)<---What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him? (James 2:24)<---Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by faith only.

Mq9dxmh6JiE,"I'm getting annoyed that people think just because Fenty foundation is water base and also per Riri doesn't oxidized; assume it's not going to oxidized . Foundation does get darker. Doesn't matter what situation .  What plays in is the person's skin type, how their bodies natural PH levels on the skin reacts to the formula , how much humidity is in the air, what products they put on before hand can cause a small chemical reaction to the foundation. Just because one is selling out doesn't mean it will work for you and your body chemistry.  There's a basic science to it . I hate how almost everyone in the makeup community thinks they are gurus ; yet don't know that hooded eyes can't have the same cat eye wing angle as almond shape eyes. Or something as simple as foundation . Unless you are certified in the field or know the chemistry behind it, please don't deem a product horrible if it doesn't work for you .Also if a product does work for you , doesn't mean the person who had a harder time with it doesn't know what they are doing . Simply means it's not for them . \\n       Sincerely a makeup enthusiast.",0,0

S6eJbe5GyDo,I hope you all aren't serious where's the damage it was so hyped try those being your homes. Your neighborhood. Let's see a storm hit your house and destroy it. Just a regular thunderstorm that didn't have any hype. Lightning hits a tree and boom house is destroyed.

S6eJbe5GyDo,Cheap trailers made of aluminum and ply wood held parked on bricks. Wtf do these people think will happen when they live in a hurricane state? I'm sorry but they are completely under built. The city should of changed massive codes in the 80s and stopped people from putting these shacks ups. \n\nI hope they realize a house in Florida should mean concrete walls and slab roof all reinforced with rebar and massive shutters on all windows and doors. \nJust like a cabin in Alaska is set up for major winters a house in a hurricane state should be set up for just that. A hurricane.,0,0
S6eJbe5GyDo,They should design different types of housing for areas where floods can happen.

(His name was JESUS!!!)......\\n\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n\\n(Christ Witnesses to Nicodemus on the reason why people want to stay in their sins and not accept him as their Lord and savior and as believers, you have to produce works to show that you have saving faith in God. (Matthew 3:8)<---Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance.):\\n\\nAnd this is the condemnation,\\nthat light is come into the world,\\nand men loved darkness rather than light,\\nbecause their deeds were evil.\\n\\n(Condemnation): Refers to the reason for judgment. The light referred to here is Jesus, the light of the world).\\n\\nFor every one that doeth evil \\nhateth the light,\\nneither cometh to the light, \\nlest his deeds should be exposed.\\n\\n(People offer many excuses for not accepting Christ. Some cite the presence of hypocrites in the church. Others claim inability to believe some of the truths about Christ or the gospel. These are merely attempts to conceal a heart in rebellion against God. The ultimate reason people do not come to Christ is that they do not want to).\\n\\nBut he that doeth truth \\ncometh to the light, \\nthat his deeds may be made manifest, \\nthat they are done in God.\\n\\n(The one who does the truth, (1 John 1:5)<---This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all), is obviously, already a believer because his or her deeds are done in God. Therefore, coming to the light is more than exercising faith. A person who comes to the light not only believes, but also openly identifies with the light so that his or her works can be seen as things done in union with God. (Jame 2:14)<---What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath faith, and have not works? can faith save him?

CzYM4ZpSDJg,why do white liberals hate white people so much?,6,0
CzYM4ZpSDJg,Aren't us white people terrible? Good thing we have Hollywood to tell us.,6,3
CzYM4ZpSDJg,Yes...always a white person's fault. This racism is horrible. The Caucssion race has done more for this planet than any other race (including my own) and I'm quite frankly tired of seeing Caucasians constantly blamed for another person or group's problems. Hawaii was conquered and brought into the fold because they were weak. That's it.,1,0
CzYM4ZpSDJg,Also the royal Hawaiian palace had electricity before the White House did. True story.,0,0
CzYM4ZpSDJg,give us your money and go home,0,0
CzYM4ZpSDJg,"The story of Hawaiian statehood is a very painful thing for many native Hawaiians even now. And the many, many misconceptions people have about Hawaii doesn't end there, either. So much of what I see in media about Hawaii paints a false picture of what it's like here. It's good to see the truth here, even in such a short video. 😊",0,0
CzYM4ZpSDJg,So the Queen couldn't just arrest them? She had no soldiers? wow,0,0
CzYM4ZpSDJg,"Definitely over simplified, but glad the information is getting out there somehow. My people are a strong people and we live aloha, but the misconceptions and pure arrogance/ignorance can become rather heartbreaking. It's an interesting and terrible story, but reading/researching if you're interesdted is definitely recommended.

CzYM4ZpSDJg,"Well, after the overthrow the Provisional Government of, and later the Republic of Hawaii were formed by the Hawaiian Rifles and the Hawaiian League. James Garfield resisted annexation which the Provisional Government was in favor of and sadly, President McKinley finalized the annexation, just in time to secure naval interests in Pearl Harbor for the upcoming Spanish-American War. Congress sent their own investigations into Hawaii, both from the pro- and anti- annexation leagues in Congress. In the end, McKinley was able to annex the islands, and in 1902 the Hawaiian Flag was lowered for the last time as a national flag, being replaced with the U.S. flag over the 'Iolani Palace. The leader of both the Provisional Government and the Republic was James Dole. To this day, we have a successionist movement calling for the restoration of the Kingdom, similar to Texas' successionist movement. It's funny because we have a high school named after McKinley and we have the Dole Plantation as a tourist attraction.",0,0

CzYM4ZpSDJg,why do white liberals hate white people so much?,6,0
CzYM4ZpSDJg,Aren't us white people terrible? Good thing we have Hollywood to tell us.,6,3
CzYM4ZpSDJg,Yes...always a white person's fault. This racism is horrible. The Caucssion race has done more for this planet than any other race (including my own) and I'm quite frankly tired of seeing Caucasians constantly blamed for another person or group's problems. Hawaii was conquered and brought into the fold because they were weak. That's it.,1,0
CzYM4ZpSDJg,Also the royal Hawaiian palace had electricity before the White House did. True story.,0,0
CzYM4ZpSDJg,give us your money and go home,0,0
CzYM4ZpSDJg,"The story of Hawaiian statehood is a very painful thing for many native Hawaiians even now. And the many, many misconceptions people have about Hawaii doesn't end there, either. So much of what I see in media about Hawaii paints a false picture of what it's like here. It's good to see the truth here, even in such a short video. 😊",0,0
CzYM4ZpSDJg,So the Queen couldn't just arrest them? She had no soldiers? wow,0,0
CzYM4ZpSDJg,"Definitely over simplified, but glad the information is getting out there somehow. My people are a strong people and we live aloha, but the misconceptions and pure arrogance/ignorance can become rather heartbreaking. It's an interesting and terrible story, but reading/researching if you're interesdted is definitely recommended. Queen Liliuokalani did her best and it was unfortunately not as simple as There is nothing I can do! Here! You win!!",0,0

CzYM4ZpSDJg,"Well, after the overthrow the Provisional Government of, and later the Republic of Hawaii were formed by the Hawaiian Rifles and the Hawaiian League. James Garfield resisted annexation which the Provisional Government was in favor of and sadly, President McKinley finalized the annexation, just in time to secure naval interests in Pearl Harbor for the upcoming Spanish-American War. Congress sent their own investigations into Hawaii, both from the pro- and anti- annexation leagues in Congress. In the end, McKinley was able to annex the islands, and in 1902 the Hawaiian Flag was lowered for the last time as a national flag, being replaced with the U.S. flag over the 'Iolani Palace. The leader of both the Provisional Government and the Republic was James Dole. To this day, we have a successionist movement calling for the restoration of the Kingdom, similar to Texas' successionist movement. It's funny because we have a high school named after McKinley and we have the Dole Plantation as a tourist attraction.",0,0

Of course, I learned a lot more from my Hawaiian classes and was able to find out more of the truth.

Their videos are free to us and they spend a lot of time and effort making them. We should be happy when sponsors back creators of color. Watch the videos.

Hawaii was conquered and brought into the fold because they were weak. That's it.,3,2

James Garfield resisted annexation which the Provisional Government was in favor of and sadly, President McKinley finalized the annexation, just in time to secure naval interests in Pearl Harbor for the upcoming Spanish-American War. Congress sent their own investigations into Hawaii, both from the pro- and anti- annexation leagues in Congress. In the end, McKinley was able to annex the islands, and in 1902 the Hawaiian Flag was lowered for the last time as a national flag, being replaced with the U.S. flag over the 'Iolani Palace. The leader of both the Provisional Government and the Republic was James Dole. To this day, we have a successionist movement calling for the restoration of the Kingdom, similar to Texas' successionist movement. It's funny because we have a high school named after McKinley and we have the Dole Plantation as a tourist attraction.",0,0

Why I get subscribed to your channel at first, I was looking for tips for starting a youtube channel and I find one of your tech talks and I was so impressed, finally someone to explain in an easy way (beginners) how to film, what to use and everything. Then I start watching your other videos, and actually I really enjoy the way you are thinking about living our live, I admire you for your decision after your divorce, to put yourself under a microscope and start exploring and uprating yourself to be a better version of you and than to connect again with someone. I find that very inspiring and motivating., because like I always said' | love people, because every human is another world, on another universe, but you teach me that before start exploring other universe and planets, first expore your own. Thank you, for that  Maya. I like your channel also for all the girly stuff (make up, hair tutorial, skin care etc.) I like to watch those videos, even that most of the time I am like: Damn girl you are a pro, I will never could do that :) But who knows, may be one day I would.

How about mice, rats, raccoons, opossums, birds, insects and that is just for the land not even going to go into aquatic animals.

CzYM4ZpSDJg,Yes...always a white person's fault. This racism is horrible. The Caucssion race has done more for this planet than any other race (including my own) and I'm quite frankly tired of seeing Caucasians constantly blamed for another person or group's problems.

On January 17, 1893 at the time of the threat of violent revolution the Queen yielded her constitutional authority not the Committee of Safety/Provisional Government but the United States so that upon the facts being presented to it, undo the action of it's representative and reinstate me in the authority which I claim as the Constitutional sovereign of the Hawaiian Islands.

We used to break the law by vandalizing property on Halloween painted up like the ICP and that is because me and my homeboy wanted to. That is a far cry from gang activity! \\nI grew up in a gang infested and controlled neighborhood, I was a familiar to the gang because I was too scared to go through the initiation where they beat the mess out of you for several minutes. I definitely didn't tell them about being a Juggalo because they probably would have beat the mess out of me without the benefit of being a member of the gang afterwards! It is ridiculous to call being a fan of a band gang affiliation. I am glad that this sub culture is standing up for their right to listen to music and wear the merchandise of whatever band they want without discrimination.",0,0

However, if a crime is instigated by someone who has those marks, then it's both logical and prudent to assume that such individuals may be a part of a much larger crime syndicate.

The Caucssion race has done more for this planet than any other race (including my own) and I'm quite frankly tired of seeing Caucasians constantly blamed for another person or group's problems.

On January 17, 1893 at the time of the threat of violent revolution the Queen yielded her constitutional authority not the Committee of Safety/Provisional Government but the United States so that upon the facts being presented to it, undo the action of it's representative and reinstate me in the authority which I claim as the Constitutional sovereign of the Hawaiian Islands.

But it was a self record for both BTS and armys. Then INU came out, they got their first ever music program win, in two years, yes two years. And now, getting 20 millions in a day and not in a year, breaking records, grabbing that daesangs, I couldn't be more proud. These boys literally started from the basement and now look where they are, for the new fans out there, they weren't always successful and popular, they created the stairs to the success themselves, and with their fans there is nothing they can't do...

Have a fresh, out of the box Switch that has never connected to the internet before and setting the date to July 11th or the date of Iwata's passing and doing a set of hand motions with the joycon.\\n2. Or you wait a year and on July 11th, you use a certain hand motion with the joycon to unlock the emulator.\\nRest in peace Iwata, we thank you for everything you've done.

3fILUAGw2mE,"Some say that Albert Einstein believed in a creator or Intelligent design. It is unconfirmed about which religion he most supported or if he believed in something else all together. But I will say that I am a Christian and a Philosopher. (Which if you didn't know already is the origin of science and government.) \\n          \\n I know that you are believer in science, so I also expect you to be either agnostic or atheist. If you are an atheist, then according to my understanding of the word: there is nothing I can do to convince you of God's existence. If you are an agnostic, then according to my understanding of the word, you are a true skeptic. \\n\\n(I define atheist as someone who rejects the concept of God and an agnostic as someone who doubts the concept of God. I am not being judgmental or presuming anything. I just define them this way so that I can distinguish between the two.) \\n           \\n            And if you are a man of science, then you must understand and accept an important philosophy: You have to look at all the facts for both sides of an argument before making your decision about who is more accurate. (And according to my Physics teacher, Nothing is science is ever proven. There is just evidence that supports an idea.)\\n           \\n        If you support this philosophy, then you must consider yourself agnostic rather than an atheist. If this is true about you, then I can give you links to evidence for God's existence, discussions about biblical topics, and even a testimony about an atheist who became a Christian. Once you have learned this knowledge, you can make up you mind afterwards.\\n\\n(THE FOLLOWING IS ADDRESSED TO EVERYONE. I INVITE EVERYONE TO READ THE FOLLOWING AND REPLY ACCORDING TO WHAT IS BELOW)\\n\\nI will not be posting the links on this comment. I will also not be posting it as a reply to it. Instead, I will be posting them elsewhere. Read the following to find out where.\\n\\nIf you claim to be an atheist even after seeing my definition of it, reply to my comment.\\n\\nIf you claim to be an agnostic based on my definition of it, do not reply to my comment. Instead, go to my channel, click on any video, and say this in the comments: Alpha and Omega.  If you do this, I will provide you with the links.\\n\\nIf you are a Christian, or claim to be one (since there are false and half-hearted Christians), do not get involved if anyone starts arguing with me. Instead, reply with these words: GODS NOT DEAD. If you want to see a testimony or grow in your understanding, post this as a comment on any of my videos on my channel.\\n\\nIf you are a Jew or Muslim, I also invite you to see the links. While I do not doubt your belief in God, I do ask these questions. To Muslims, Is Allah really  the same God as the one Jews and Christians believe in; and do you really understand what Muhammad really teaches? To Jews: Why do you reject Jesus as the Messiah? Do you reject him because that is what you were taught, or did you choose to reject him after researching what Christians believe. For Muslims, go to my channel and comment the word: ALLAH If you are a Jew, go to my channel and comment this phrase on any of my videos: The Books of Moses. \\n\\nIf you are part of another Religion, I will ask you this. Do you believe out of tradition? Do You believe because you chose to? Do you believe half-heartedly? Or are you devoted to your beliefs? Regardless of what the answer is, I can  tell you that only the one who is devoted will remain after I provide evidence. If you have any doubts about your beliefs or yourself, comment this on any of my videos: John 3:16\\n\\nFor members of a cult, I have nothing to say accept this. Time is running out.

3fILUAGw2mE,"This theory is solid, but it doesn't go far enough. Lust's Alchemy Stone is made entirely from a 1 14th component to a human soul, lust. So it stands to reason that she only has the average value from a 1 14th part that is used as a full part. What I mean to say is that Lust doesn't have the full value of a soul because she lacks 13 parts of the 14 part total. Also in FMA they explicitly state that you cannot bring somebody back form the dead because each soul is unique and worth a value of immeasurable energy. Thus it also stands to reason that the compound effect of a full 14 part soul is literal infinite energy. So I devise that the more completed a soul is the more exponential it's energy output can be. I also note that every individuals' ratios of vices and virtues would differ making Lust a combination of the average lust on the 539,000 souls used. This is the plight of splitting a soul. Dumbledore wisely stated that splitting a soul is the result of never examining the value of an intact soul, I'd say the statement stands true in this theory. Enjoyed the video though.",0,0

Envy's real body is huge and took more attacks from Mustang. \\n3. Half her weight? Does that include her clothes? Are you sure only half her body is burned each time? What about the first time Mustang attacked her with the water from the pipes?\\n4. Wrath's stone gave him the ultimate eye, or did it? I don't know if it's mentioned in the anime or not if they stones give homunculi their abilities or if thats the result of taking that aspect from someone's personality.

Moments before Mustang incinerated her, Hawkeye shot her senseless until Hawkeye ran out of bullets. Before that, Mustang also shot her a few times, and she opened up her own chest to reveal the philosopher's stone. After that, Mustang tried to rip her stone out. Her body decomposed and she regenerated a new one from a single blood vessel. Even before that, Maes Hughes stabbed her in the forehead.

3fILUAGw2mE,"When he burns lust, he isn't destroying her atoms itself though. That would require he use the equal energy of 19 hydrogen bombs just to destroy her. And he didn't have a philosophers stone. What he was doing is breaking bonds within lust's molecules. Her mass is conserved, it isn't being broken down into pure energy. So you would have to calculate the energy needed to break the molecular bonds within lust, water would be the highest value, as you add energy to turn water within the body to steam. Then you would have to look up other bond values for fats, tissues bone, etc. once you find the energy needed to basically cremate a human body, you multiply it by 9 for every time he incinerates her, then you have the correct energy value. Matpat's logic was that when he burns lust, he destroys the very atom itself turning it into a slew of protons, neutrons, and electrons and energy. values to break apart the atom itself is extremely high, which is where the big numbers come into play, the Hiroshima bomb only successfully destroyed .7g of atoms of uranium out its 7kg uranium payload. That little mass released a huge amount of energy, however not enough to fully release its maximum potential energy. Bottom line, there would be no way he could safely nor effectively transfer that amount of energy to destroy lust in such a way.",0,0

3fILUAGw2mE,I just had a thought that Brian actually dies saving his son in the explosion in Furious 7 and Toretto is seeing a figment of his imagination and fueled by rage. This gives him the Edward Cullen syndrome as he keeps pushing stunts to be closer to and see Brian. I.e. Just driving backward off a GD mountain and tumbling down it... Or the building to building jump. It even kinda makes sense if he imagined the last goodbye. Though in a good way. But hey that's just a theory..,0,0

3fILUAGw2mE,"I think your theories are based on a single universe. like say a single movie of that universe. two of your theories I really like. the matrix and full metal alchemist theories. but what if the human soul  can produce enough energy to start a new big bang to reset the whole cosmos that a necessary evil has to be done to control that power. Wouldn't that be logical for the machine of the matrix. but again that's two different theories in two different universe and each theory you do is based on that movies universe, right? I just like to think that there is a bigger picture her than meets the eyes.   thinking outside the box, way WAY outside the box,  everything is one and based on the singular theory of our universe. which is were every story and movie and science is based on, I don't know. just saying 😎",0,0

Besides, you're not solving the variable that Pride represents, since he's The only hommunculi that can age (In both versions of the anime... although has different names)... also, you're forgetting the canonic basis of the anime: ALCHEMY, which allows the characters do transmutations and such... so yeah, it`s a nice approach... but I think it's a work in progress...

05v4nfUmBYI,"Idk. They've been one of my top bands for the longest time. I discovered them back in eighth grade and now six years later I'm not sure if I'm looking forward to their next album. I just kinda feel like they might blend into all the other EDM type pop bands. I felt like something was always off about TIH like idk it just didn't feel right. Some tracks were incredible while others either felt very cluttered or a bit unfinished. I could never really LOVE this new sound as much as their old one. I could enjoy it very much as some points but in the end it grew a bit tiresome. Of course they can create whatever kind of music they like and I totally respect that. I gotta say though, I'm really gonna miss their old style. Maybe it was the what was to me the drastic change. WTM was the album for chill drives with close friends while TIH delivered those upbeat dance party jams. idk. still fell like im in the limbo of loving the current state of these sooper rad doodz. At least they're experimenting and trying new things. That's cool.\\n\\nThis song though. To me, is pretty bland. I feel like I've already heard this song every other way possible.Yes, we're unstoppable and we'll keep on for what? There's no story, no wordplay, no unique connection to the lyrics. Aquaman and Cone Under the Covers were my favorites from TIH because the lyrics reflected off of the atmosphere created by the instrumentals.\\n\\nAquaman had those awesome 80's effects blending nicely with the tropical-esque beat. There's the water representing the relationship jump that maybe those involved are afraid to take. The metaphors about diving in and seeing if you'll float are just so clever and romantic as heckk. The bridge is like come on we can do it just trust me. Then the key change is the jump into what they we're afraid of. They realize that it's better than anything they could've possibly imagined. So so good.\\n\\nCome Under the Covers starts with a low hum setting a scene up. as the song progresses, more layers are added, building the tension and establishing that there's something that's going to separate the two lovers. This is the last time they can be together. The chorus explains how this separation is something they can't stop. The bridge shows how close they've grown and how it's uncanny how good they are for each other. The breakdown really stresses how bittersweet the whole experience has been.\\n\\nIdk. I just hope that they have something else in store besides (this is harsh) forgettable edm anthems. Which wasn't the case for Shut Up and Dance. That one just got overplayed. Best of luck to these guys though. Most likely still buying the album. Whoo Hoo! WALK THE MOON FOREVER WWWAAAAHHHH IM lowkey HYPE though",1,0

The first design basically just turned the same direction over and over, they fixed that. They improved the carts. The music that played when they first introduced the speakers on the cart reminded me of Rob Zombie Dgragular. They have probably changed that out again.

3fILUAGw2mE,"Love your newest FMA theory... but sorry to be nickpicky about this...At around 8:00 I remember that Father simply used some of the souls he has to cut off the energy of the tectonic plates that the Amestrian alchemists used to power their alchemy. This was to make sure he has power over his chosen human sacrifices. Later in episode 61, Father loses this advantage thanks to Scar activating the nationwide alkehestry circle to restore the Amestrian alchemists' alchemy back to the way it should've been.For the most part, your theory is based on possible assumptions.However, you have to take into account that maybe not all of the Homunculi are created equal. It's possible that some have more souls in their philosopher stones than others. For example, Envy seems to contain a lot considering he's (or should I use it since I don't think Envy even has a definite gender?) been killed throughout the series quite a number of times and still have plenty left over even after his sacrificing some of his stone to get out of Gluttony's stomach stint. But unlike Pride, who was practically half-dead from forcing Roy to perform human transmutation, Envy was relatively fine.You also haven't taken into account that they also use their stones to do the things they can, like transforming into another person, creating shadow appendages, changing their body into a carbon-based armor, and creating long fingernail spears. Going back to Envy again, how many times have we seen Envy transform on screen? Considering it was given the responsibility for keeping track of the ongoings of the country and military via infiltration, it'll probably have used up all supposed 38,309 souls by the time the series started.But anyways, sorry for the rambling.

Cause that's what he trades for to tie Al's soul to the suite of armour, and what Al trades for to bring back Ed's arm :P\\n\\nSo the question is, is the answer still the same when you plug in the mass of a decently healthy kid's right arm? And would it still work if you plug in the mass of a young adult's very malnourished right arm?\\n\\nOf course, that's only if trading with Truth is the same as normal alchemy. Also, if we're talking about how much energy a soul is worth, Ed also uses his own soul energy to heal his body. I think he says that it'll take a few years off his life, or something like that. It's been a while since I've watched, okay?\\n\\nGreat theory though :)\\n\\nEdit: for all you people complaining about how the math is off because Lust has died many more times before the Roy incident, just use this one to one ratio the anime provided for us and calculate it yourself, I'm sure the information you need is somewhere on the Internet :/",0,0
3fILUAGw2mE,Look at your video where you say (evil)Morty will kill rick. Rick could have experimented on are Morty with the jumper cables( SO THIS MEANS IT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN EVIL MORTY) and taken his memories away because of the most recent episode where Morty has a memory Bank of stuff he couldn't handle. And it had tons of memories where Rick tortured Morty and he took the memories so he wouldn't kill him,0,0
3fILUAGw2mE,"It should be noted that Lust probably had a lot less than her original amount of souls. It's unlikely that she had lived without generating a single injury. Father also would have had less souls because of having to recreate a sin every now and again as well as powering the world's alchemy. On the same track, Lust (and the other sins) would have even less souls due to expending them for their own power. These are just a few factors I can think of but there are probably heaps more",0,0
3fILUAGw2mE,alright so some flaws.\n1: this isn't her first lifetime. she has lived for a longer period of time so the battery isn't at 100%. \n2: she has taken hits before. some that you saw and some that maybe you haven't. remember she has lived a long time.\n3: they are not all as strong as one another. such as pride stating he was the oldest and strongest. \nthis is a good theory but since it has so many holes it's virtually impossible to really calculate. then again it's anime so...,0,0

05v4nfUmBYI,"Idk. They've been one of my top bands for the longest time. I discovered them back in eighth grade and now six years later I'm not sure if I'm looking forward to their next album. I just kinda feel like they might blend into all the other EDM type pop bands. I felt like something was always off about TIH like idk it just didn't feel right. Some tracks were incredible while others either felt very cluttered or a bit unfinished. I could never really LOVE this new sound as much as their old one. I could enjoy it very much as some points but in the end it grew a bit tiresome. Of course they can create whatever kind of music they like and I totally respect that. I gotta say though, I'm really gonna miss their old style. Maybe it was the what was to me the drastic change. WTM was the album for chill drives with close friends while TIH delivered those upbeat dance party jams. idk. still fell like im in the limbo of loving the current state of these sooper rad doodz. At least they're experimenting and trying new things. That's cool.\\n\\nThis song though. To me, is pretty bland. I feel like I've already heard this song every other way possible.Yes, we're unstoppable and we'll keep on for what? There's no story, no wordplay, no unique connection to the lyrics. Aquaman and Cone Under the Covers were my favorites from TIH because the lyrics reflected off of the atmosphere created by the instrumentals.\\n\\nAquaman had those awesome 80's effects blending nicely with the tropical-esque beat. There's the water representing the relationship jump that maybe those involved are afraid to take. The metaphors about diving in and seeing if you'll float are just so clever and romantic as heckk. The bridge is like come on we can do it just trust me. Then the key change is the jump into what they we're afraid of. They realize that it's better than anything they could've possibly imagined. So so good.\\n\\nCome Under the Covers starts with a low hum setting a scene up. as the song progresses, more layers are added, building the tension and establishing that there's something that's going to separate the two lovers. This is the last time they can be together. The chorus explains how this separation is something they can't stop. The bridge shows how close they've grown and how it's uncanny how good they are for each other. The breakdown really stresses how bittersweet the whole experience has been.\\n\\nIdk. I just hope that they have something else in store besides (this is harsh) forgettable edm anthems. Which wasn't the case for Shut Up and Dance. That one just got overplayed. Best of luck to these guys though. Most likely still buying the album. Whoo Hoo! WALK THE MOON FOREVER WWWAAAAHHHH IM lowkey HYPE though",1,0

Only the outside of the building is still reminiscent of the Jules Verne - Steampunk styling.

You seem to believe that the seven virtues would be represented equally with a large enough sample size but that just isn't the case. This is a civilization, their values are taught and retained differently. Consider Faith for example, if you were to take an equal amount of people from a holy city and one where religion is not a required teaching you might find the lack of faith disturbing.\\n\\nEven sticking with the assumption that Lust's stone had received an equal amount of souls, you are also assuming that their battery is fully charged. That obviously can't be the case with how she impales people that aggravate her, and it's doubtful that was the first time she was in danger or needed healing. \\n\\nFather has been shown to recreate the homunculi as well, but it is not stated if there's an equal return when he reforms them or if they get more power through their own means while out there.

3fILUAGw2mE,"I think that every time a homunculus dies in the show, a human life is expended to bring them back. The reason I say this is because when Ed used the philosopher stone in Envy to escape Gluttony's endless stomach realm, one human disappeared from Envy's body. After ally, Envy's true form is basically all the lives in his philosopher stone taking form around his body (or something like that). But perhaps it takes more than one soul to regenerate their entire body. My point is that maybe your calculations are a bit off since we don't know how many times Lust died in the past after being created. So we can't just assume that her philosopher stone is fully charged at the time when Lust was killed by Mustang. But still a really interesting theory nonetheless",0,0

3fILUAGw2mE,"MatPat, do not fear doing theories on Anime, Manga or Eastern Style Video Games. If watching Anime, reading manga and playing video games have taught me anything is that the Japanese are F*CKING nuts! But that...is awesome! Even if we were on the strongest hallucinogenic, mind altering drugs concentrated to their 100% purity all put in a bowl and snorted up at all once in one breath, we still wouldn’t come close to they level they are at. Even after all this time and countless (because I’m still watching) series, episodes and chapters; Anime, Manga and Eastern Style Video game still hold the power to shock the crap out of me...which I love I love that they can still do that even after all this time. With that being said...just a few tings. One. Watch One Piece, it is awesome and not as long as the Manga which has reached its 879 chapter. 2. Watch InuYasha. It was on the same channel as Cowboy Bebop and is awesome. 3. Since you showed it and if you haven’t, watch Soul Eater. 4. This makes me twitch all the time but people who just start out watching Anime do this all the time or just become aware of it...you are pronouncing Naruto’s name wrong, just as people say Pokèmon wrong all the time.

ouJwpthMfkY,"Jaclyn, I wanted to write this comment in hopes that you'll read it, and in providing full disclosure: I have been following you for several years and have been a huge fan. Your tutorials are helpful, you have amazing taste, and are generally really entertaining. After so much focus on negativity, however, I will be unsubscribing. Even mentioning the negative comments gives them more fuel than they could ever deserve. It turns what could be a really positive, engaging, and fun video to watch, into a curiosity to read the comments you're referring to, or want to 'track down' whatever social media negative story you're referring to. I imagine that this is quite the opposite of what you're hoping for, but that's what I think is actually pulling in even more negativity to your channel, and as a consequence of that, you are actually driving out the people who genuinely like you, like me. I would rather be subscribed and watch videos of youtubers who pay no mind to the negativity (it's out there, all the time, on every channel), because I want to watch videos that from start to finish make me feel positive and happy, and not curious to engage in others' negativity. I wish you the very, very best in your endeavours.",0,0

Only the outside of the building is still reminiscent of the Jules Verne - Steampunk styling.

-C-LJUD2LWU,"i watch these videos and wonder where the fuck  do these people come from. Candace isn't saying anything that I and a few others have been saying for years. Why she's been allowed to parrot everything we've been saying on Fox News now, makes no sense to me. Media is trying it's hardest to intertwine Left/Right politics into  everyday's  real life, real/world issues. \\nYou better research who these people are before you let them put on the act of standing up for anybody other than their selves. It won't be long before she's on a media tour repeating the same script on every network/big media platform. \\n\\nThere's too many people hurting in the world for anybody to pretend to want to make change. There is no talent to making YouTube videos of other ideas and adding cheesy edits. There aren't very man, but there are people who have been fighting long and silently to make a real difference in this world. Where these parroting characters come from, is beyond me. Everybody has an agenda and she's not hiding her Conservative card. I type this not as a liberal or anything remotely close to the 'Left'. Both sides have long disappointed me and neither side is building towards the future that I want for my child. I type this as a Child of God, a man of reason, and a naturally empathetic Soul. \\n\\nThese people don't come out of nowhere and 10 times out of 10, their word is not their own. For anybody who has been trying to make a change in this world and is reading this, ask your Self why YOU haven't been invited to any platform to air your political views. If you're anything like me, could it be because you care about people more than an imaginary political duality? People like Candace (and a lot of channels shoving Left/Right bullshit down our throats) are  the result of infiltration into a once uncontrolled exchange of real news without agenda. This can be seen with the large number of  unoriginal, rhetoric repeating channels popping up on YouTube injecting Left/Right politics into everything. \\n\\nWhy so much typing? Because me and others have been working on actually fixing things. Not empty, back and forth debates that result in nothing done for any citizen in pain/need. Out of nowhere/overnight online personalities soaring out of nowhere to only extend the previously mentioned debates dilutes the work that me and people like me have been doing for years. More importantly, it keeps people ignorant to the fact that there are people with real fixes (proposed laws, acts, etc.) who are silenced. It bothers me watching politicians pretend like they don't know what to do or how to make things better. \\n\\nLast thing...hold your public servants more accountable.",0,0

What will help ALL the people in this country would be to vote for a real progressive, like Nina Turner or Bernie Sanders. They will put workers first, AND this country first, and then you will really see a change for the better.\\n\\nAlso, a lot of this has to do with black culture. Larry Elder has many great points on this; it is based on single motherhood, and this lionization of the thug life. If more blacks valued education, joining law enforcement, and becoming professionals in the science and medical fields, then there would not be this widespread problem with drugs, crime, and other issues.

3fILUAGw2mE,"Your entire theory rests on the idea that Lust is creating her body from pure energy. Maybe she is. But is it not conceivable that she's simply transmuting the air around her into flesh or pulling the particles of her that Mustang just blasted off back into place? That would probably cost her less energy than making herself from scratch.\\n\\nYou also assume the homonculi all have equal shares of father's souls. But that's simply not true, as evidence by their very different abilities which have different costs and the different ways that they die. For example, Wrath just has super-human strength speed, reflexes, and vision, but doesn't regenerate. Sloth can regenerate, but his ability to do so is significantly less than Lust's or Gluttony's, with him being killed not by nine intense fiery explosions, but by a couple strong men and some sharp spikes of rock created by an alchemist. These guys aren't all equal, and so your estimate both of the number of souls and of their value is off.\\n\\nAnd you also got the alchemy method wrong. Western alchemy works not because of father but rather by opening The Gate within every alchemist. Father knows how to cut off their access to that gate temporarily.",0,0

3fILUAGw2mE,"I don’t usually comment on these sorts of things, but FMA has been my jam for the better part of 15 years now, so you better believe I’m gonna jump on this like Gluttony on a burger. There’s several issues in this theory that throw the calculations way off.\\n\\nFirst of all, the inclusion of the Seven Heavenly Virtues. First of all, the Virtues don’t appear until Aurelius Clemens Prudentius’ poem Psychomachia, written around the 5th Century AD, while the Seven Deadly Sins as we know them first appear in the 4th Century through the writings of Evagrius Ponticus. (Thanks Wikipedia!) With a full 100 years between the two, it’s pretty safe to say that these are not equivalent parts of the soul. Of course, all of that is a moot point since Hiromu Arakawa herself has said that Christianity does not exist in the world of FMA, so including the Virtues at all is a no-go from day one. With that, the calculation of the average number of souls per Homunculi should be doubled. This is of course assuming that each Homunculi has the same number of souls. \\n\\nSecond, the calculation of how many souls it takes to regenerate Lust during the fight against Mustang has two MAJOR assumptions that completely ruin the theory overall. First, it assumes that Lust’s Philosopher’s Stone is “full”. We know for a fact (A Film Fact!) that Lust has been killed at least once before thanks to Maes Hughes (RIP in pepperonis), and it’s safe to assume that she’s been killed several times before then. The FMA fandom wiki puts her age at about 250 years old, and although I can’t find any source for that, I think it’s safe to say that she’s been around the block a couple dozen times. This means that she’d also have the normal energy drain from aging, on top of the massive dips when she’s killed.\\n\\nThird, and I’m really surprised that MatPat didn’t bring this up, but since Alchemy is a science, it’s also subject to our good old friend Entropy. Transmuting energy into matter has to have a massive hit to entropy. We don’t have anything close to exact numbers, but I think we can assume that the entropy created when turning a soul into flesh is pretty massive. \\n\\nAlso, and this is a nitpick, but we really can’t assume Lust’s weight. Both Envy and Gluttony have been shown to be much heavier than they appear physically, so it’s not outside the realm of possibility for her actual mass to be much higher.\\n\\nBut hey! Assuming spherical Homunculi in a vacuum, at least your math is right! And that’s juuuuuuust a theory! An aaaaaaanime theory!",0,0

3fILUAGw2mE,"As a youtube commenter I feel it is my obligation to needlessly overcomplicate an otherwise excellent theory. Lust dies and regenerates a couple of different times in the series before she ultimately meets her end. Not to mention, she's 400+ years old so there is probably an uncountable number of similar instances of regeneration throughout her lifespan that we don't see. Also, it's reasonable to assume that using her powers would drain some of the energy from her stone, and unless she only recently began taking an active role in things, she's been draining that energy for centuries. Though it's probably a drop in the bucket, comparatively.\\n\\nThis whole comment is merely for the sake of being pedantic and pretending I'm smarter than I am, and I'm fairly certain that other commenters have made these points already, but as a youtube commenter it is my right, nay, my *duty*, to press on anyway.\\n\\nEnjoyed the video as always, good job on the theorizing :)",0,0

Why she's been allowed to parrot everything we've been saying on Fox News now, makes no sense to me. Media is trying it's hardest to intertwine Left/Right politics into  everyday's  real life, real/world issues. \\nYou better research who these people are before you let them put on the act of standing up for anybody other than their selves. It won't be long before she's on a media tour repeating the same script on every network/big media platform. \\n\\nThere's too many people hurting in the world for anybody to pretend to want to make change. There is no talent to making YouTube videos of other ideas and adding cheesy edits. There aren't very man, but there are people who have been fighting long and silently to make a real difference in this world. Where these parroting characters come from, is beyond me. Everybody has an agenda and she's not hiding her Conservative card. I type this not as a liberal or anything remotely close to the 'Left'. Both sides have long disappointed me and neither side is building towards the future that I want for my child. I type this as a Child of God, a man of reason, and a naturally empathetic Soul. \\n\\nThese people don't come out of nowhere and 10 times out of 10, their word is not their own. For anybody who has been trying to make a change in this world and is reading this, ask your Self why YOU haven't been invited to any platform to air your political views. If you're anything like me, could it be because you care about people more than an imaginary political duality? People like Candace (and a lot of channels shoving Left/Right bullshit down our throats) are  the result of infiltration into a once uncontrolled exchange of real news without agenda. This can be seen with the large number of  unoriginal, rhetoric repeating channels popping up on YouTube injecting Left/Right politics into everything. \\n\\nWhy so much typing? Because me and others have been working on actually fixing things. Not empty, back and forth debates that result in nothing done for any citizen in pain/need. Out of nowhere/overnight online personalities soaring out of nowhere to only extend the previously mentioned debates dilutes the work that me and people like me have been doing for years. More importantly, it keeps people ignorant to the fact that there are people with real fixes (proposed laws, acts, etc.) who are silenced. It bothers me watching politicians pretend like they don't know what to do or how to make things better. \\n\\nLast thing...hold your public servants more accountable.",0,0

What will help ALL the people in this country would be to vote for a real progressive, like Nina Turner or Bernie Sanders. They will put workers first, AND this country first, and then you will really see a change for the better.\\n\\nAlso, a lot of this has to do with black culture. Larry Elder has many great points on this; it is based on single motherhood, and this lionization of the thug life. If more blacks valued education, joining law enforcement, and becoming professionals in the science and medical fields, then there would not be this widespread problem with drugs, crime, and other issues.

ouJwpthMfkY,The L'Oréal concealer burnt my eyes too that's crazy I thought it was just me,0,0
ouJwpthMfkY,I've heard a lot of people saying the Lo'real pro glow concealer is burning their skin and their eyes. I have it and I personally haven't had that happen but I don't have sensitive skin. I do have to wonder though since it's common knowledge that fragrance is the #1 cause of skin irritation why are cosmetic companies still putting strong fragrance into their products? I personally love a cupcake scented lip product but I still prefer my complexion products to be fragrance free. And luxury brands need to stop with the overly strong floral scents in EVERYTHING!! I have a powerful nose and I end up tasting the awful chemical rose scent... So gross!!,0,0

ouJwpthMfkY,"First - this makeup is everything! So stunning :) But second, with there being so much hate on youtube I wanted to take a minute to spread some love & positivity. Jaclyn has been one of my favourite youtubers for years now and that is because she is truly an artist and so good at her craft! But it is also because of the fact that she is fearlessly herself. In real life, if I saw someone as beautiful as Jaclyn I would probably think she would look down on someone like me and wouldn't give someone the time of day. But the beauty of youtube is that I have got to see that she is a normal woman just like me and that our senses of humor are identical! We will never know everything about Jaclyn and her life and nor do we have the right to but we are lucky that we can share in her talents and see what a beautiful human being she is :) \\nSo keep slayyyying queen <3",0,0

Cause then we make a example out of u. Meanwhile the biggest people in charge in this country have some of the worst habits and addictions poor people have.  Yet they are never told on exploited embarssed or exposed. That happens to the black people. Even poor white people have it better then us. At least they can clean up and act the part. If your white n poor in American your a fuk moron that deserves poverty.  The entire country is set up for u to win.  Black kid plays with you gun outside and is killed like a dog. White kid shoots up a church full of blacks.  Not only is he caught without being killed. They brought him cheese burgers.  Lmaoooooo that's the hate white people have for blacks. Read the comments under Travon Martins stories you tube. This country hates anything black unless it have a team jersey on scoring points or singing and dancing for u pale face peices of individual shits. And we need to hate them back. They hate so they win. The can piss in a bottle and call it champagne.  If we piss in a bottle it's just piss. And I'm sick of the double standard.  But that will all b over soon enough.  The old ways and old people are dying. What was the minority last year won't b soon. I wonder how blacks will treat whites in 50 years. I pray it's at least a fraction of the hospitality that has been shown to us. Since the first aboriginal was killed on this land along with the slaves brung from Africa.  I hope that dept is paid back times 20. But I can only wish for something in the same category my ancestors felt while being whipped shot killed chased down and hunted by you people. I will never bite my younger when it comes to how I feel about u people. Like Rich Piana called magic Johnson a filthy nigger. For what? But when the racist bastard died they tried to make him some beautiful person. Fuk him dead n alive. He was a racist fuk yard. Yet everybody tried to say no big deal. He don't feel like that anymore and it was years ago. Such bullshit.  Pure bullshit,0,0

x5Ps13AeXxQ,"Everyone is giving you so much crap but this is the realest video I've ever seen you post. The cheery, forced happy you once were has died and it's refreshing you see the real you. I can relate to this. My boyfriend struggled with drug abuse in the past and it's crept back into his life, now our life. It's not something I participate in or have ever participated in and it wasn't in my plan for my fairytale relationship. It's messy now. That's the best way to describe it. Your perfect relationship has died and now you're left with this mess to clean up. I know how you're feeling. It's draining and sometimes it doesn't feel worth it but when you love someone with demons you don't give up on them because they're not perfect or they don't fit the mold anymore.",0,0

x5Ps13AeXxQ,I burst into tears every time I heard your laugh. I can’t believe you’re back. I started watching the shaytards back when I was 11 maybe? Now I’m 18 off living at University and to be honest your guys’ videos helped me through so much when I was growing up. With depression and anxiety issues it was hard but having the consistency and routine of watching your family every day gave me something to always smile about even though I know you weren’t perfect. And I think as people who know Jesus we are expected to live these perfect lives but what we know is that’s not what our faith is about. It’s about the challenges and trials we are put through and how we grow in ourselves and in the footsteps of Christ. Lots of love. Thank you for coming back ❤️,1,0

Instead of putting a smile on your face and pretending to think everything will eventually be okay, you should know your worth.

_cu4FHyCcT8,"Good idea. Love the presentation potential. I think I'll try separating the topping, filling, and apple bowl. Trick is to cook the apple bowl so it's not as firm, yet still durable enough for the filling so it doesn't sag. I'd cook the cooking separately. The topping possibly could be done last and broiled in the oven once all put together. I'll have to play around with the presentation, but I love the concept.",0,0

yNaLblrdflU,what a strange but interesting choice casting Travolta. Will check it out. I really liked Armand Assante's portrayal.,0,0

yNaLblrdflU,I can't believe a movie was made about this criminal scumbag.,0,0

yNaLblrdflU,This is just a remake.,0,0
yNaLblrdflU,Dumbest possible actor to remake Gotti. Armand Assante did it best and it should've been left at that. Now you have a dimple chinned brunette doing Gotti? Fuck outta here,0,0
yNaLblrdflU,Thumbs down. John Travolta's acting is overdone in this; he's not at all convincing as Gotti. The trailer was painful to watch.,0,0
yNaLblrdflU,What gay rumors? I don't know about why John did all that stuff like kissing the guy by the plane. This is Oscar worthy stuff. Real acting. You forget it's Travolta.,0,0
yNaLblrdflU,Travolta. He will be the best Gotti yet. He never made a bad movie his entire life.,0,0

yNaLblrdflU,"Hmmm, looks pretty good.  I'll wait for the reviews.  I will have to temporarily suspend my boycott of current Hollywood films & celebritards.  Travolta's constant scowl seems rather exaggerated in this trailer.  I checked out MANY images of Gotti and he never looked quite that mean all the time.  It is interesting that Travolta and Tom Cruise, both closeted gay Scientologists, have new films out.  The church must need money.",0,0
yNaLblrdflU,Another trailer which shows basically the  WHOLE FUCKING MOVIE. I hate it!!!,0,0

x5Ps13AeXxQ,"I've grown up with addicts my entire life . Ive seen them do awful things to get their fix. But ive seen them get clean too. The most important things they need to get over their addiction is love, support and patients. Contrary to what mainstream media tells us, addicts arent bad people. Theyre people who made bad decisions whether they knew it or not. Getting clean and staying clean is completely possible :) Many people I know who have been hooked on something have been using the substance as a form of escape, whether it be a mental iillness or something in their lives. But at the end of the day we are all responsible for our own actions, though that doesnt mean that we dont deserve love and sympathy even though we've made the wrong decisions. (for people reading this in the comments no im not saying that alcoholism was the reason for everything that happenned in their situation, im not even really talking about them and their situation im just making a point ahout addiction and how evil it can be)",0,0

x5Ps13AeXxQ,"Thank you so much for sharing. When I found out what happened I was enraged with anger towards marriage because I too went through a VERY messy time with my husband. It made me think, wow, so many of the good ones can't even be trusted. \\n\\nAnyways, I am glad you shared how your situation is making you who you are today and that you wouldn't have it any other way. I actually started a channel of my own FOR ME :) when I came out on the other side of my troubles. Everyday is a battle when you've been hurt that badly but I too feel like I am a 1000x better as a person now. That I've found more peace in who I am as an individual. I am definitely going to check out the book you referred to. I still haven't shared anything on my channel, but I contemplate it all the time, wondering if my story, my journey could help someone else out there. It's a make or break point in your life when you are betrayed like that by someone you NEVER thought would betray you.\\n\\nI never comment like this, sorry it's so long. I just felt the need.",0,0

x5Ps13AeXxQ,"I think you opened me up with this video the way the book opened you up. I felt angry after I found out what happened because like you, I've always wanted the perfect relationship and that prince charming that would love me so much. I didn't think it actually existed until I saw your vlogs since the first year Shay started. Since then, I started telling myself, 'SEE.. TRUE LOVE DOES EXIST. THE PERFECT MAN DOES EXIST. There is such a man that adores his wife everyday, can look in her in the eyes and tell her she's beautiful and would do anything for her.' I started believing that this can be reality and I started looking for it and expecting it. I felt betrayed and lied to and started getting angry with myself for thinking it can happen. But I am grateful for your vlogs because I still believe I am able to find a great man. But because of this video, I also decided to let my dream die. But that does not mean I will settle for something less that what I deserve. I will still search for a man I am willing to fight through hurdles and rain for, like you with Shay. I believe if you found the one, you can get through whatever comes your way and I know you can Shay can get through this and come out stronger. I love you and the strength you are giving to women like me.",0,0

x5Ps13AeXxQ,"There are so many harsh and evil comments that stem from evil minds who want to see a broken family. Shay is a good and forgivable person. Making a mistake does not automatically make someone a bad person. He is a kind of person who can easily be manipulated by evil people. He should be very careful with this kind of Hollywood atmosphere. They got married when they had nothing. They have 5 beautiful children and built a wonderful career together. Because they love each other. If she forgives shay and decides to live together for the betterment of herself and the whole family, who are we to tell her otherwise? My advice to Collete and Shay is that they should come back to youtube full force with a renewed spirit. Don't ruin what you are best at. Abandoning what you have built and regretting is not an answer for such kind of situation. You have to show your loyal youtube family that with hard work and perseverance anyone can raise from the ash. This will uplift your fans and send a great lesson for evil minds.",0,0

x5Ps13AeXxQ,"Collette, I missed you so much for starters but in life I've figured at the age 15 years old (I'm still 15 now) that everything happens for a reason. Everybody has dreams as a child, I do now but I know that won't always go to plan and take place. You and Shay might have needed this to happen between you two so that you have a better relationship in the future. I ninth years time you and Shay could be saying to each other I'm glad this happened because it's made you two stronger as a couple. It probably will take a while but like I said everything in life happens for a reason. There's no other way that you could change what has happened between you two so it's not your fault but it's not Shay's either because life will take you down different routes to happiness and thats just the way your paths went...... I'd love to see the kids by the way because it honestly feels like I've grew up with them because I've watched you since I was like 8 and I'm now 15 so I've nearly watched them over half my life as I've grew up x",0,0

x5Ps13AeXxQ,"The decisions you have made are yours and yours only. No one will truly know or understand what's happening behind closer doors. The only thing I wanted to mention was how you shouldn't let your dream go of wanting a prince charming. You being his wife and the mother of his children it should be expected that he treat nothing less than what a prince charming should treat his loved one. The moment you let that dream go is the moment that it is okay to not meet those expectations. You have earned it. Through thick and thin you have earned to be loved, adored, and respected. Do not let that dream go.",0,0

I will always be a fan of you guys!!! I think this should be a whole family thing. I know Shay struggles with that and you don't have to.

Colette is supporting him because she loves him, if everyone gave up as easy as you are wanting then no one would ever be in love. It is her life not yours. Keep your opinions to yourself.",0,0

yNaLblrdflU,What I really don't understand is why is America praising the Italian mob knowing that they're no different from gangs in the street even games in the street or more organized just like the mob but my point is why is America praising the Italian mob by even renaming the Italian mob and calling them the American mob always trying to snatch something up for this country quick to make a movie about John Gotti this is the second movie I believe they made about John Gotti but did they ever make a movie about Tookie the founder of the Crips in California that's no different than the mob the only thing is that people believe the Crips started out as a gang but they started out as a positive image to protect their community against drugs and any other type of negativity this country is run by a bunch of bigots hypocrites and racist MF to continue two praise the Italian mob but when it comes to anything else pertaining to the minority like the Latin Kings the Decepticons the Bloods and the Crips the low life Nation you know me movies that's coming out in the theaters for them but they support the Italian mob and rename it the American mom like that's supposed to be a part of American history America is full of BS and I was born and raised here honestly I wish they never even showed this movie so damn disgrace.,0,0

Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God! Your playing small doesn't' serve the world. There's nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it is in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.

And if she decides to stay and work it out I think she should be commended and Shay should realize what a lucky bastard he is. Colette you do you girl, the you you are today is an amazing strong women, mother, sister, daughter.",0,0
x5Ps13AeXxQ,"Y'all need to just shut up and leave Colette alone. She is a grown up and she can make her own decisions. I DO NOT support what Shay did on all of the levels, but Shay and Colette are figuring things out the way they know how. Y'all live in a fantasy world that makes you believe that you should always be happy in your marriage. Reality does not always grant that happy option. In a marriage, you are constantly tested on several levels of your trust, selflessness, and so many other things. I don't condone cheating of any kind, but there are so many mistakes, selfishness, and other wrong actions couples do in a marriage. Nobody ever said a marriage was going to be easy, happy, and with no difficult obstacles ahead. What makes a marriage successful loving each other, even when you run into difficult circumstances such as cheating, a fight, or anything else that can cause a marriage to break. That was part of y'alls vows that you said to your spouse. Now I get the whole once a cheater, always a cheater saying. But, when a spouse decides to fight through the difficult part of loving their spouse after the hurtful and losing trust in that person, they are doing what it takes to keep the marriage going. Anyways, Colette I'm behind you 100%. You are beautiful and you know what you need to do. God is with you every step of the way and He will always love you!",0,0

x5Ps13AeXxQ,These comments are disgusting. You are entitled to your own opinions yes but these people left their career for a long long time to get back on their feet and work through all the problems they've been having. That's a hard thing to do for anyone especially when hundreds of thousands of people are telling you to stay. Shay admitted to his mistakes and he is working hard to fix his mistakes for his wife and kids. We have supported this family for years and none of you can honestly believe that they or anyone else is a perfect human being. I don't know about any of you but I will always be a supporter. These people have got me through my hardest days and now we need to help them get through theirs. Stop making this a one way street everyone needs a little support and love at one point or another.,0,0

x5Ps13AeXxQ,I don't know how I feel. Part of me finds this inspiring. Part of me hears you say words like alcohol manifested in his life as if it was a demon who manifested and that made him hurt you so bad and break his marriage vows. Cheating on you. It's so wierd. And I also find it very unrealistic that you say it's been a blessing on the momsview video. How is it a blessing to get cheated and lied to by the one person who's vowed to do the opposite? I hope you don't mean that. But it's very inspiring how you can turn this around and be stronger from it all. I just don't know if shaycarl is worth your beautiful heart. But then again we don't really know anything. It's just those posts exposed abt him...so disturbing. It's just unnerving how shay probably thinks you'll never leave because of your religious beliefs. Anyway you deserve happiness because of the person that you are. God Bless.,0,0

So we're all just supposed to know I guess what you talking about.  But all it sounds like to me is you settled.  You found a way to swallow the bullshit.  And i mean it's a lot scarier alone than staying together and you have the kids.  I get it.  I was there too.  But you made a choice.  But don't tell the rest of us to give up our dreams!

x5Ps13AeXxQ,"Collette I have to say that I understand what you mean about letting the dream die. It is a therapeutic way of allowing ourselves to move on from what we thought life would be like. I had to let my dream die of being the perfect mother and having the perfect life when I miss-carried my first baby and my third baby ended up being an ectopic pregnancy that had to be surgically removed. I have two beautiful girls (2nd and 4th pregnancies) but those pregnancies/ babies were a very painful experience of loss for me and it was hard to come to terms with the fact that my dreams of motherhood, pregnancy, and those sweet babies being in my arms was not to be. Life did not turn out the way that I had always dreamed it would. I don’t know that anyone’s life really does. The reality of daily life and all the things that we struggle with can be difficult but I believe that our faith and our ability to be thankful for all the things we do have in our life that are a blessing can help us build new dreams that we can strive for. One dream may die but there are always new dreams we can create with love. While we are still alive all things are possible. Love you and sending you a big hug and kiss to you and all the shaytrads.",1,0

EYi1YUNOguk,"What happened is horrible, I knew people there but what everyone needs to understand is that if they banned AR-15s, handguns or really anything, it won't change a thing. Not because crazy people will still do bad things but because the gun isn't what you think it is. Take the AR for example, they are modular like most firearms these days. The lower receiver is the gun because it has the serial number, that's the only thing, just a piece of aluminum and a few springs would be banned but they leave out that little detail. 99% percent of the parts will still be available and that's true for glocks, 1911s and AKs. All you need is either some sheet metal and a rivet press for the AK receiver or a chunk of aluminum, access to a computer and a buddy that has a Cnc machine or even basic hand tools (if you have the patience) for the AR. I've even seen AR, Glock and 1911 frames made with a 3d printer you can buy a home-depot, you can download the specs from the government websites, (thanks freedom of information act)👍! we are past the time when they could disarm the public, there was nothing anyone could do on this one as far as I know. These bleeding heart talkshow hosts and actors need to stick with what they know and understand that they don't live in the real world and people need to stop giving these people the time of day because most of them make their money pretending to be a fake person made up by someone else that is usually high on cocaine or painkillers.  Every time I try to watch something now I get told how to think and what's right and wrong. Those poor people were still warm, some hadn't even gotten covered up yet and instead of banding together and leaving the political BS for another day, they start with the guilt trips telling us that something needs to change well thanks for the insight buddy but here in America nothing starts the week off right like a good ole fashioned mass shooting, they talk to us like we're stupid, like children, like we enjoy this but 2A is there and if we loose that then we're screwed. 1A will be next and so on. I just wish we could attack the real issues here and not just take the easy way out. Ya man, England has no gun violence..... they just have groups of men raping little girls, cops arresting the dads when they try to save them, guys cutting off soldiers heads in the street and more guys running around stabbing and cutting the throats of  innocent people drinking coffee but hey, you have an accent so you must know what's up. thanks A-listers!Because when the shit hits the fan, we can always count on a few words of wisdom while you guys travel from your gated communities to your studios, complete with armed security guards. 👍👍",0,0

EYi1YUNOguk,"James - where are you when there are drug/gang violence and deaths in Chicago and Washington DC?  Gun law restrictions are strong in both of those cities - yet thousands are hurt and over one thousand die per year in those two gun controlled cities.  If you are concerned about murders/violence - then lets address A) gang/drug violence in big cities b) mental health issues and C) enforce all existing gun laws.  Also realize that a vast majority of gun violence deaths are suicides.   Things need to be done - but not ignoring the big picture (addressing the complete issue of drugs, violence, mental health issues etc).",0,0
EYi1YUNOguk,"People, not guns, are and always will be the problem. Viewing gun killings and murders as if they are two seperate things is not going to get us anywhere.. What you should really focus on is unity (not conformity) of the people of America. Find a middle ground to everything and stop complaining. Peoples children, spouses, parents, siblings, were murdered and wounded and everyone with a microphone is turning it into a political speech for their agenda.. When did we all get seperated between left and right. What happened to just being American.. Guns arent the problem for mass shootings. Just as spoons arent the problem to obesity.. Simply tools used for the wrong reasons..",0,0
EYi1YUNOguk,"Full auto weapons are already illegal to own, unless you are a Class III License holder. Explosives are illegal to have , but are used in tragic attacks in Europe. One way to try to prevent future attacks is by actually trying to apprehend suspects. Though, the suspect took his own life in this instance, many other times, police gun down the suspect. Explanation for their reasoning is complete speculation afterwards, and we just theorize and speculate why they commit such atrocities. Yes, guns kill many people for the wrong reasons, but one must understand that's because it's the first item in a long list of ways to kill someone. Take away guns, then, like Europe, IEDs will be used. Then, chemicals, poisons, fires, diseases, and many, many more things that could be used. The problem isn't what they are using, but it why are they using it. \\nAlso, on a side note, the weapon used sounded to be a full auto, bump fire stock, or pull-release fired trigger group. The last option are backorder for months, and the flawless cycle rate makes me think the second options wasn't used either. Full auto firearms are not easily accessible. One has to be skilled in gun smithing AND machining to make one. I feel there's much more to this story. I theorize  he could have even be a decoyed scapegoat. I'm pretty sure those rooms are all connected. It's plausible the real gunman got away, leaving this dead body for the police to think he commuted the act.",0,0

EYi1YUNOguk,"There are 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, and this number is not disputed. The U.S. population is 324,059,091 as of June 22, 2016. Do the math: 0.000000925% of the population dies from gun related actions each year. Statistically speaking, this is insignificant! What is never told, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths, to put them in perspective as compared to other causes of death:\\n• 65% of those deaths are by suicide, which would never be prevented by gun laws.\\n• 15% are by law enforcement in the line of duty and justified.\\n• 17% are through criminal activity, gang and drug related or mentally ill persons – better known as gun violence.\\n• 3% are accidental discharge deaths.\\nSo technically, gun violence is not 30,000 annually, but drops to 5,100. Still too many? Now lets look at how those deaths spanned across the nation.\\n• 480 homicides (9.4%) were in Chicago\\n• 344 homicides (6.7%) were in Baltimore\\n• 333 homicides (6.5%) were in Detroit\\n• 119 homicides (2.3%) were in Washington D.C. (a 54% increase over prior years)\\nSo basically, 25% of all gun crime happens in just 4 cities. All 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause.\\nThis basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state. That is an average because some States have much higher rates than others. For example, California had 1,169 and Alabama had 378\\nNow, who has the strictest gun laws by far? California, of course, but understand, it is not guns causing this. It is a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal persons residing in those cities and states. So if all cities and states are not created equal, then there must be something other than the tool causing the gun deaths.\\nAre 5,100 deaths per year horrific? How about in comparison to other deaths? All death is sad and especially so when it is in the commission of a crime but that is the nature of crime. Robbery, death, rape, assault are all done by criminals. It is ludicrous to think that criminals will obey laws. That is why they are called criminals.\\nBut what about other deaths each year?\\n• 40,000+ die from a drug overdose–THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT!\\n• 36,000 people die per year from the flu, far exceeding the criminal gun deaths.\\n• 34,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities(exceeding gun deaths even if you include suicide).\\nNow it gets good:\\n• 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. You are safer walking in the worst areas of Chicago than you are when you are in a hospital!\\n• 710,000 people die per year from heart disease. It’s time to stop the double cheeseburgers! So what is the point? If the liberal loons and the anti-gun movement focused their attention on heart disease, even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total number of gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides ................ Simple, easily preventable 10% reductions! So you have to ask yourself, in the grand scheme of things, why the focus on guns? It's pretty simple:\\nTaking away guns gives control to governments. The founders of this nation knew that regardless of the form of government, those in power may become corrupt and seek to rule as the British did by trying to disarm the populace of the colonies. It is not difficult to understand that a disarmed populace is a controlled populace.\\nThus, the second amendment was proudly and boldly included in the U.S. Constitution. It must be preserved at all costs. So the next time someone tries to tell you that gun control is about saving lives, look at these facts and remember these words from Noah Webster: Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed.",0,0

Just because people will look for ways to hurt others doesn't mean we should make it easier for them. We can cite giving up rights and protection from tyranny as an argument against control, but in my personal opinion given our track record as a society we should be looking to protect our basic human right to right to life and safety. A YouTube comment under a video from a late night comedy show might not be the correct platform to discuss this but I encourage everyone here to stop typing for a second, put our personal views aside, do some unbiased (to the extent to which it can be done) research, and truly do some reflection on the issue.  I am no expert, I do not claim to have the answer,s but all I can  hope for is that we can try to have an informed and productive conversation on this issue. Only then we can take the necessary steps together, as a society, to make sure that these unspeakable atrocities do not continue to occur.",0,0

SO cant you see your fucked up logic?",0,0
EYi1YUNOguk,"Thank you, James. That was a gorgeous speech and honestly I’m getting extremely sick and tired of the gun violence. There’s so much of it and people are dying at rapid rates, and it’s disgusting that innocent people are dying because of some psycho people deciding to shoot up a random place. But sadly, there’s no simple solution to this, we can’t just do one thing that would hurt another side of things, because that side will then revolt. Because that’s what we are; why can’t we all just agree on something sometimes? Hopefully everyone agrees with me when I say that I’m not just going to sit around and watch it happen, we should do something about it. If you’re reading this, find some way to help victims and states that are going through rough times like these. We can all stand together and unite, as we all stand divided as of late. We need to fight. This is disgusting, and I know that no matter what there are going to be people in the world who just cannot be changed. People will continue this, because there are just some no good, and people in this world. It’s despicable and as the United States we’ve never been more divided than we are. I’m rambling on now, but you get the point. Thank for James for that extra push that I needed. You truly are an amazing man :). Pray for Vegas.",0,0
EYi1YUNOguk,James shut your fucking mouth. We beat your ass over 200 years ago because we had guns. One bad apple mate. Now seriously shut up. You made millions here. Go home if you don’t like it.

I bet the English would love it and say wow we didn’t know what the fuck to do until you came along. Thank you for showing us the way.,0,0
EYi1YUNOguk,You wanna see shooting? Change the law and tell the 180 million Americans with guns that they can’t have them anymore. Then you’ll see some shooting.

EYi1YUNOguk,the 2nd amendment is bc of your homeland James. Yes this tragedy is horrible and preventable in ways that don't fringe on American liberties born out of British oppression. Regulate how weapons are sold yes. How they are manufactured (to limit full auto after production adjusting) yes. To limit an American free of criminal and terrorist ties who legally obtains a weapon built within limited capability is wrong and millions of Americans didn't die in War for liberties to be taken. Not by a lone gunman or several over time. Do we make fertilizer illegal or hard to obtain bc you can make a bomb? How about getting rid of planes so terrorist can't use them again. Or maybe knives... Bc there will be more knife deaths in Europe this year by terrorist than all mass shootings to date in USA. I'm deeply saddened and cried when I heard of las Vegas.

EYi1YUNOguk,"Cause of 1 mental person..... 59 lives are now gone. And I've no clue what the families are going through. Wars, mass shootings..... how long...... these will go on for how long!!!!!????? A family... having dinner together in their home and the next thing you know is that... a 3 years old is now an orphan.... because a bomb dropped on their roof top...  and his mom dad are now no more.... He will have to beg from now on.... for food.... cause there's no one else to take care of him.  People praying..... with their friends and family.... may be in a church or mosque or some place.... and then a freak shows up and starts shooting at them.... just cause he felt to do so.  Having a good time with your loved ones.... and the next thing you know is that you are the news.... Some fucked up psycho shot you in the head and you didn't even get the chance to ask why....  And your not alone....    there was another guy in a different part of the world... who was also killed for no reason....  May be the killer didn't like the color of his shirt.... May be.  \\nWe as sober people... we need to ask why. If your political leader who can't even lift his own ass... is asking you to kill someone... then as a human it is your duty to ask why.  If a 16 years old is buying a gun from you then it is your duty to ask why. If a civilian is entering your hotel with automatic rifles then it is your duty to ask why.  If you are not satisfied with the answers then go further... Inform the police... let others know. If not for others.... at least do it for yourself.  Because someday... you might be the victim....  someday you might be in that terrible news.",1,0

One comment I have on this: the cynicism you talk about in science fiction is a result of the own modern society's barbarism. It is that same society that created that perception. The illusion that we all go through every day of our lives is unbreakable and so we, as people living within it, have to accept it. I believe it may sometimes be irresponsible and naive to think of a better future bathed in optimism. Yes, we have to struggle for that idea, but in the end it will be futile. The universe and it's fiction will all continue in the path it intends to, there's not much we can do about that. Her is a beautiful film but one that,  in the grand scheme of things, looks fake, modern, and hip. Not really how the world's future should be represented imo.",0,0

x5Ps13AeXxQ,"Colette you are a beautiful strong woman of God. You are so wise beyond your years. It is truly a gift that one cannot gain with their own ability. As much as I am hurt and resentful of what happened, I know you have experienced it on a whole other level. We fall when we begin to see ourselves as god, and sometimes we fall even when we have lived righteously. Either way, we fall so we can learn from it, so we know and acknowledge God as God, and we are able to understand His love and grace. It is only when we are at our lowest, when we can't think of how anyone could possibly love us, when we can't bear to love ourselves, that we realize there is One who deeply cares and who deeply loves us. It seems ironic or unconventional, but sometimes it is the only way for us to get closer to Him. I only pray for blessings growth in your family. Would we let go of all our idols, whether it be fame, money, self-glory, for the One who deserves our best. Colette, I mourn for you, but I also have immense joy for the great courage, strength, and love that you have gained through it all. Would your children learn from you and look up to you.

x5Ps13AeXxQ,"All the people on here disappointed in her for staying, I ask you to consider the fact that he did not have sex with another woman. He sent inappropriate txt msgs to a cam girl and got exposed for it. I'm not saying it's not cheating because to me, it definitely is, but I think it's an important distinction to make. Ending a 15ish year relationship over a physical affair would be difficult enough, but because of text messages? I think it's easy to say we'd all walk away, but I'm sure it's much harder in the situation, and I think her decision to go through the difficult process of forgiveness and working through it all shows a lot of strength. It doesn't sound like she just let him off the hook. It sounds like she is working towards what she wants, and we shouldn't judge her either way.",0,0

x5Ps13AeXxQ,"Colette, you are such an amazing and strong woman that i admire greatly. I can’t even imagine what it would be like to go through something this personal and have it announced to the whole world. Just because you’ve been through all this it doesn’t mean you have to give up your dream. Someone like Shay doesn’t deserve an amazing woman like you. I know you love him but think about your self worth. Is staying with him worth the chance of your heart getting broken again?",1,0
x5Ps13AeXxQ,he cheated and it'll forever stay and remind you but not until you get revenge cheat back then get your relationship back on or really just drop him he's a fucking cunt,1,0
x5Ps13AeXxQ,"Staying with your husband is setting an example for your children that if someone cheats or is disloyal in their relationship, it's okay to stay with them. Wrong. That's nowhere near okay. You love Shay, god you love him you've spent so many years together. He's the father of your children, he's your everything, but he doesn't love you the way you think. If he truly, truly loved you, he wouldn't have seeked other women. You are showing your kids that being cheated on is okay because you're afraid to lose Shay. You deserve so much better and I hope you realize that. Much love x",1,0

x5Ps13AeXxQ,You’re going to accept the fact your husband cheated on you yet stay with him? Cheating isn’t something normal people should accept. A man being faithful shouldn’t be a dream it should be a standard. Love yourself enough to leave and know you deserve better.,2,0

x5Ps13AeXxQ,"I think the one thing that everyone is forgetting in the comments is that, we didn't know 100% of the shaytards lives. Yes we knew a lot of it, and they feel like family, but we don't know everything that Colette went through, or how bad Shay's alcoholism is. Sure, I was very angry and disappointed when I realized that Colette was still with Shay, mostly because I think she is an amazing mother, and person, and human in general and he does NOT deserve her AT ALL. I also don't think alcoholism is an excuse for cheating. Yes. It was cheating. But the thing is, my opinion on the matter, doesn't matter. It is not my life. It is not my relationship. BUT WHATS IMPORTANT IS Colette has been through enough, and yet, she came on here, being vulnerable, EXCITED to share what she has learned with everyone, just to have everyone going in the comments with their opinions on how she should live HER life. Every one chooses to live their lives differently and deal with relationships differently. Forgiving is one of the hardest things to do and yet, she makes it look so easy. Everyone keeps saying that she is just letting Shay get away with what he did. She is not. She admits he broke her heart. She admits life is messy. She admits she still has hard days and that her and Shay's relationship isn't great right now. Take a moment and realize that we should be here sending her love, and supporting her, rather then continuing to tear her down. She didn't have to come back, but she did. She is truly one of the strongest women out there. Give her a break.",0,0

It's full coverage, doesn't have an odd fragrance (my skin is really sensitive to any scent whatsoever so I HAVE to be picky), doesn't make my skin breakout, and doesn't have that odd cakey/clay like consistency compared to the other foundations I have tried.

73kIG3HcFq0,"I absolutely loved this analysis and many of the videos you've posted, your work is fantastic. One comment I have on this: the cynicism you talk about in science fiction is a result of the own modern society's barbarism. It is that same society that created that perception. The illusion that we all go through every day of our lives is unbreakable and so we, as people living within it, have to accept it. I believe it may sometimes be irresponsible and naive to think of a better future bathed in optimism. Yes, we have to struggle for that idea, but in the end it will be futile. The universe and it's fiction will all continue in the path it intends to, there's not much we can do about that. Her is a beautiful film but one that,  in the grand scheme of things, looks fake, modern, and hip. Not really how the world's future should be represented imo.",0,0

Seeing what a family looks like. Of course all family's have their ups and downs but mine has been like a land slide ever since I was 3... maybe even before that. But seeing you guys it gave me a glimpse of a life that was different from mine and one I wish I got to experience. I can't wait to see your comeback with the family and just ugh I love you guys so much",0,0
x5Ps13AeXxQ,"Colette, you are an incredible, beautiful human being, and inspire me to no end. I am so happy to see you again, and to know that you and your family are doing well <3 You have helped me through rough times in my life, and I hope my continued support (as well as that of your other followers) helps you through yours. You are so strong, honest, and inspirational <3\\n\\nNobody can tell you whether you made the right or wrong decision, because the only person who can know that is you. Every relationship is different and has its own dynamics. Only the people within that relationship can determine what is healthiest for it. I agree with you that we have to be willing to let our childhood dreams die, because there is no such thing as a perfect relationship. I've been with my boyfriend for 4 years, and though we've never dealt with what you're specifically dealing with, it certainly has not been easy, and we've had challenges that seem insurmountable. I've had to let go of some of my expectations and childhood dreams, and so has my boyfriend. Accepting reality has helped us come closer and be happier instead of trying to feel satisfied with illusions of what we think we want and need. \\n\\nYou seem so honest in this video, and I'm so happy to hear that you've been doing things for yourself, and feel more true to yourself than ever before! That indicates to me that you've been making amazing decisions for yourself and your family. I wish you the best of luck on working on your relationship and continuing to be an incredible mother to your beautiful children. You are so strong and resilient <3 I'll be keeping you and your family in my thoughts and prayers <3",0,0

This has clearly been extremely hard and painful for her and I really really admire her OMG I don't think I could have done it... literally because I don't think I'm that strong... and if eventually she wants to walk away from it OMG she totally can guilt free of course but LET HER MAKE HER OWN DECISIONS HOLY CANNOLI THIS WOMAN IS STRONG AF AND I CANT BELIEVE PEOPLE ARE CRITIZING HER,1,0

Accepting the present doesn't mean that you shouldn't act about what you can change. \\nI simply still see a ring on your finger which to me means that for the time being you have accepted that your present will be your near future. Again, only accept the present for as long as you can't change it.

SPZFN6VFFow,"A normal response to a human tragedy can be found by listening to the radio commentator when the Hindenberg went down in flames. Utter Sorrow for the lives lost and expressing devastation. That is the correct and normal human response to a tragedy, even if your own family member caused it. We are not armchair psychologists .We are normal people looking at this guy making insane excuses, bragging about money, putting down the majority of Americans for not thinking that $100,000 is a large amount of money, bragging about eating thousands of dollars of sushi and also saying that he and his family are on a different level than the rest of us. He contradicts himself constantly. He makes excuses Instead of expressing genuine grief and sorrow over the lives lost. For those of you who think that this man is normal and that his response is normal, take a look at some of the Interviews from other family members in the past who were in just about the same spot that this guy Eric is in. It is rare to see someone respond the way that he is responding. If you cannot see that, then there is something very wrong with you. You don’t have to be a medical professional to understand that this man has a severe personality disorder. I am a medical professional, and I deal with people just like this guy. He is a narcissistic sociopath. His brother was likely the same and according to accurate reports, his father was on the FBI’s most wanted list. It ran in the family. If you see someone like this be Vigilant. And most of all stay away from that person and report if that person has a large stash of guns or talks of strange end of the world or end of life scenarios.

I'm going to look past it though and realize there are reporters at his house, and he's - concuss - over this.  I give him credit for talking to the media and trying to help.  They need to leave this man alone now though, there's nothing more to gain from this and its not good for him, us, and especially the victims families and loved ones.",1,1
SPZFN6VFFow,All you need to ask is two things. \n1) Did he hate trump. \nor\n2) was he a muslim.,0,1
SPZFN6VFFow,I don't understand all the confusion when it comes to motive after this interview. The simplest explanation is that the murderer had a 'postal' reaction to a perceived slight by his employers; the casino's.  There was definitely premeditation but with the emotional chaos that a man often goes through when he feels disrespected; ruminating on the slight and how to get his honor back... and unfortunately for a lot of people he had the resources and social/demographic anonymity to see his plans come to fruition.,0,1

73kIG3HcFq0,"I enjoyed the artful way the video was made & I respect its premise. Still I view Her as not presenting a harmless view of the future. Yes it's playful with its hipster esthetic & it mostly scales down its conflicts to a personal / individual level. Still Her has a core idea that AI technology could be a widespread, very intimate addiction (leading to society control issues by AI). So, while Her is not an apocalyptic dystopia, imo it still has an edge to it which is dystopian.",0,0
73kIG3HcFq0,What a awesome video. I have been watching this movie like 3-4 times a year simply because of the reasons you mentioned. Also happy birthday!,0,0
73kIG3HcFq0,Her's (interior) design is IKEA's wet dream.,0,0
73kIG3HcFq0,"Good analysis, but I'm going to have to disagree with you. Sure, 'Her' is filmed in a warmer colour palette, and has a less dystopian tone, than most sci-fi films. However I wouldn't say that the future presented in 'Her' is beautiful. Most shots of the city and other public spaces are dominated by overpopulation and a kind of smog, showing the effects of global warming having gone too far. I don't think global warming is beautiful in any way, nor any less frightening than a dystopian society like 'The Handmaid's Tale' or '1984'.",1,0

9fgtEM8-VTI,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂\\n\\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",0,0

The people we elect do that. I don't claim to be all gung-ho for the government, but frankly, this announcement simply offends me. If we, through our elected officials, decide to at least restrict ease of access to some kinds of weapons so that criminals at least need to spend more time and money and effort to get them, then that is what we are going to do, or not do.

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂\\n\\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

XswVWE0Jq84,"You're not wanting anybody wanting you\\nI get it, all is fair\\nBut I've been biting all my cherry hearts in two\\nYou don't even care\\n\\nWon't you ever come down from the big rock I found you climbing\\nStowing your diamonds away\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nYou kissed me once\\nWhen we were drunk\\nIt left me spinning on my heels\\nCalled the devil for a deal\\nYou kissed me once\\nWhen we were drunk\\nMy head went rolling on the floor\\nPast the window, out the door\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nOnce I said it I knew I would regret it too\\nIt's just too much to share\\nNow you're fading, sailing in the night\\nFor the boy who wasn't there\\n\\nI'm a practical guy\\nBut sometimes I can fly off the handle\\nThinking in scandalous ways\\nI've never done time\\nBut I've done the crime of wanting\\nSomething that never could stay\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nYou kissed me once\\nWhen we were drunk\\nIt left me spinning on my heels\\nCalled the devil for a deal\\nYou kissed me once\\nWhen we were drunk\\nAnd now I'm nervous when we meet\\nI got nothing under my feet\\n\\n[Outro]\\nYou kissed me once\\nWhen we were drunk\\nIt left me spinning on my heels\\nCalled the devil for a deal\\nYou kissed me once\\nWhen we were drunk\\nMy head went rolling on the floor\\nPast the window, out the door",10,7

The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens.

rFaoaCJ1R8o,"Wow! The sound this thing makes gave me such a vivid mental image, picture this scene while the sound of this video plays: slowly pan up from the ground while crawling over a floor cluttered in mechanical components, as the camera reaches nearer to the subject the crawling speed gradually increases (pan up stays constant for now), we can see an angular shadow comprised of complex shapes moving together in jerky clockwork motions. As a secondary beat track is introduced to provide a crescendo, the pan up suddenly increases exponentially to reveal a mad scientist debuting his menacing mechanical monster! Cut to black with silence. Eerie tone as the text fades in from black and from blurred to sharp: October 31st 2020",0,0

9chSjcOM5og,"Do you all not see that they brainwash you?\\nDo the people even know that the first man to legally own a slave in America was a BLACK man named Anthony Johnson? Look it up people education is everything today. Let us talk about privilege for a moment; As it all stands now, not one white person truly knows what it feels like to take pride in our own race without fear of being persecuted. If a white person is poor we are looked down on as being lazy, with blacks however it is because “racism”.  If a black person has money they are looked up to, but if their white has it then they are “spoon-feed”, or “exploiting others”. If a white commits a violent crime towards blacks they are “racist” and will be prosecuted to the fullest, but if a black against white crime happens it is “justified”. No white person alive “since 1961” has ever known what is like to get hired for a job over another race, because of our skin tone. With ‘affirmative action’ black children can go to private schools for free, but whites must pay, the same thing with colleges, the workforce, etc. When a white person commits a crime it is on every media outlet, but black flash mobs, gruesome murders, and all racist actions are covered by all media outlets. If a white person speaks anything against one's beliefs or makes an insensitive comment they now get fired, persecuted, harassed, and tyrannized. If a black person speaks against someone’s beliefs, and/or makes an insensitive comment nothing negative happens to them, blacks don’t even get called out on it. If and when a black person gets pulled over by the police everyone assumes it because “racism”. A black person can even be pointing a gun at the police, and people say it is because “racism”. If a white man does the same act, they are crazy, stupid, and a criminal. Blacks can, and do blame all their shortcomings on racism. Over 70% of black fathers do not take part in their children’s lives, and the same amount of mothers raise their children to become thugs, from “racism”? Ever since ‘affirmative affirmation’ took place more American have died, than all the U.S. wars combined at the hand of black thugs shooting guns, from “racism”? Anywhere you look on this planet, if the population makes up just 12% or more of the black race violence follows, from “racism”?\\n\\nPeople are so brainwashed by everything they see and hear, even our schools breed “racism” by teaching black victimization, and white privilege. Look up a man named Anthony Johnson and you will see that he was a free black man in America who owned black slaves. Johnson was the first American to even go to court and have his slave documented. Large numbers of free blacks owned some of the biggest plantations in America, which were operated by black slaves that they owned. Did I mention that only 1.4% of all Americans owned slaves? Not one of these facts is mentioned when our children learn about slavery because they want to teach hate. When you get down to it, slavery happened all over the world, to all races. Take a look at the 16th -18th century, it is estimated that 1.5 million Christian Europeans were enslaved in South Africa in the Barbary Slave Trade. Source - http://blog.encyclopediavirginia.org/2011/12/slavery-by-the-numbers/\\nThe media stepped in with their race baiting with Zimmerman, it is also factual that the media showed pictures of Zimmerman as a white man, even went so far as to lighten his pictures, and only showed pictures of  Trayvon from years before the actual incident. Here is the proof in that; https://youtu.be/qfcDIwky8lU\\nObama had a chance to step forward and put a stop to it all, but instead, he got on television, saying Trayvon could have been his son. People are so full of hate that they will not accept these truths. \\nI am telling you, people, we are all being used as sheep, controlled by television, Hollywood, schools, and our government. Who controls all these agendas? $$$$ Wake up, these elites are smart. We have repeated history, and will continue to do so if we do not WAKE UP!!! \\nIf you look into The Bell Curve you will find it scientifically proven that different races have different IQ's no matter where their environment. Yet, we are not allowed to speak about it because it's considered racist. So humanity is being held back and dumbed down. East Asians IQ's are higher than whites, and we can handle that and admit it, yet those who are unintelligent are less logical, more violent, etc..etc.. So these bastards behind the Banking system are feeding these animals white hatred, causing our people to pay for them to not only produce babies, but to make more than us, and they are forcing in millions with these low IQs into only the majority white nations around the world. \\n\\nThe United States alone accepts each year—from 70,000 Refugees in 2015 to 85,000 in 2016 and 100,000 in 2017—and scale up the number of Syrian refugees admitted to at least 10,000 for the current fiscal year, which began October 1. They are spreading them out, so it does not look Biblical. These “Refugees” do not care about our morals and values. They have not come here to help preserve our way of life, nor do they want to contribute positively to our society. We must realize that these people are being placed into any, and only the “majority white” countries around the world. If whites were any other race everyone would be calling this mass-genocide.\\nFollowing all this, if you look into the population in the once majority white nations around the globe compared to this banking system you will see that the banking system is/was doomed, and this is just one reason why we are watching all the immigrants come from these countries around the world. Think about it. If whites were being forced into Africa, so much so that the country's black population was now the minority. This monetary system enslaves us and turns us against one and other. https://youtu.be/mII9NZ8MMVM \\nOn June 4, 1963, Kennedy signed a virtually unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110. This order would strip the Federal Reserve of its power to loan money to the United States Federal Government at interest. November 22, 1963, JFK was assassinated. You all need to wake up and see what’s really going on. This monetary system has caused this. They want whites to be eliminated. They own, promote, and distribute everything we see on television, movies, stores, governments, countries, etc. Look it up, even without all the places this monetary system owns, they still have 99.9% of this planet.\\nJust think about the shows on television now compared to the ones back in the day. The ones back in the days had morals and values, and the shows that play now, like Shameless, project the unhealthy lifestyles to be grandiose. Look back and anyone can see the television has played a major role in society’s behavior. It is our duty to make this country safe for our children and their children. Why are we not uniting? Even our schooling system is spreading identity confusion. A big portion of young people do not even know which sex they are attracted to, and this system caused it all. Back when times were better one family member could work, make enough to take care of the whole house, and one parent could stay home to teach children morals and values to live by. They saw this and modified it. All we must do is unit while we still have the numbers. \\nSince President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in late 1963, more Americans have been killed by gunfire in this country than died in all U.S. wars. Not because of guns, but from black people. I believe it is safe to say it is the majority, and blacks need to stop blaming whites for everything the black race has become. You can look anywhere they are in the world if their numbers are at, or above 12%, Violence follows.\\n\\nThe rules, or principles that are unfairly applied in different ways towards the white people and what they believe in, is not applied in the same manner for any other race in this nation. We must come together and save what those before us have fought and died for, we must unite, taking back what is rightfully ours, our children's, and infinite generations after. Our state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on our way of life, behavior, and political views are now and have been taken away from our people. https://youtu.be/uMfk5UeGw4E \\n\\nAnyone can see we are wired differently, science proves this, yet we are not allowed to speak of it, because we are considered RACIST if we do. Look into The Bell Curve. This scientist won a Nobel Prize yet his life was ruined for speaking the truths. White’s better start figuring out what kind of place they want for their children, because it’s all going to shit, and this is not the time to be immobile. \\nThis country will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything. – M.G.P.",4,0

b7xndvitLa8,"Germany was pretty fucked up at the time.\\nWestern germany was pretty much enslaving eastern germany to produce a lot of products like furniture and many other things for a low price while eastern germany didn't even have acces to many of those things.\\nAnd the reason why this was going on for so long is simply because western germany  only made profits while the east wasn't able to develop and fight back.\\nThere are many stories out there and if you got caught trying to cross the well protected border, you were either caught and put behind bars if you were lucky or shot on the spot like a dog in the streets.\\nYou also were not allowed to leave the country (GDR or DDR (Deutsche Demokratische Republik) as we call it in germany) without permission to do so wich still was pretty restricted to say the least. \\nTo this day, western germany is much more developed and has higher wages than eastern germany BUT the cost of living there is also much higher.\\nIt's still pretty fucked up in my opinion and with all the new people streaming in from the southeast, the government is putting a lot of money into programs for them like learning german and everything surrounding work and stuff wich leaves germans in the dust.\\nBut I guess in 3 to 5 years everything will get better once all those people got integrated into our society.\\nSorry for drifting off lol",0,0

The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

SPZFN6VFFow,I hope they checked this dude to make sure he wasn't strapped before this.,0,0
SPZFN6VFFow,"Shock makes people act in ways that make no sense to anyone. But this guy is obviously high. He rambles like he’s on speed. He almost sounds like toward the end that this was a message. I wouldn’t be surprised if this knew everything. And to flaunt that he always knew how to be around people dumber than him so he never got caught, that was a pretty deliberate message and one that he is really feeling now",0,0
SPZFN6VFFow,"It went from an intelligent and professional response to an absolutely bizarre and ego driven self-interview about himself. He used a lot of I and Me statements when the questions were about the victims and the suspect. I hope he realizes, and no offense, but nobody cares about him.",0,0
SPZFN6VFFow,"My Analysis: He is trying to be helpful by describing the brother he once knew. In other words, he isn't denying that his brother did it. On the contrary, he was saying that his brother had the means to do all of it himself.\\n\\nLike everyone else, he doesn't understand what the motive was. He is trying to understand for himself. He has no answers, just like we don't have the answers.\\n\\nThere's footage of everything prior on the casino's cameras. They are investigating and I hope the will release more information. I'm sure they have a lot of data and can draw some conclusions.\\n\\nMy guess, is that his brother was on some medication prescribed a doctor. Sometimes these pills cause people to go crazy. Just listen to the side effects on these prescription drug commercials. For example, look at Chantix which they prescribe to people who want to quit smoking. Side effects include nightmares, delusion, depression, hallucinations, thoughts of suicide, paranoia, aggressive behavior, etc. This is for something they prescribe to people trying to quit smoking, imagine what they give to people with depression!\\n\\nIf that is true, I'm pretty sure these multi-billion dollar pharmaceutical companies wouldn't want that information to get out there. Just a theory.",0,0

SPZFN6VFFow,If brother doesn’t really know much then how does he know so well he acted alone? This is one the strangest things ever. It’s like these conspiracies are getting more obvious over time and less careless with facts. Only the naive fall for media and government lies at this point.,0,0

SPZFN6VFFow,This guy should make a YouTube channel.,0,0
SPZFN6VFFow,Idk. He seemed too eager to answer any questions that could arise from a conspiracy point of view...he didn’t seem to be shocked as in “Hey he wouldn’t do this”... It was more of a “Of course he would use a Tripod” & “He didn’t take all those guns up there himself he just has to pay a kid $100.00 to get them up there.” I mean it’s weird to say the least.,0,0
SPZFN6VFFow,"You guys are all calling him crazy and saying he was part of it , you can tell he is just tired of being interviewed. He is grieving too and and all that unwanted attention is probably what's driving him crazy . You can tell he's frustrated with all these people blaming him for what his brother did . He's just trying to get his point across , the way he is talking you can tell he just wants this to end and for them to leave him alone . Leave this poor man alone he has nothing to do with what his brother did .",0,0

My kids watch it sometimes and they dont even have to follow a story because a feud only last a couple of weeks until a pay per view then its onto the next. No build up nothing.

9chSjcOM5og,"Do you all not see that they brainwash you?\\nDo the people even know that the first man to legally own a slave in America was a BLACK man named Anthony Johnson? Look it up people education is everything today. Let us talk about privilege for a moment; As it all stands now, not one white person truly knows what it feels like to take pride in our own race without fear of being persecuted. If a white person is poor we are looked down on as being lazy, with blacks however it is because “racism”.  If a black person has money they are looked up to, but if their white has it then they are “spoon-feed”, or “exploiting others”. If a white commits a violent crime towards blacks they are “racist” and will be prosecuted to the fullest, but if a black against white crime happens it is “justified”. No white person alive “since 1961” has ever known what is like to get hired for a job over another race, because of our skin tone. With ‘affirmative action’ black children can go to private schools for free, but whites must pay, the same thing with colleges, the workforce, etc. When a white person commits a crime it is on every media outlet, but black flash mobs, gruesome murders, and all racist actions are covered by all media outlets. If a white person speaks anything against one's beliefs or makes an insensitive comment they now get fired, persecuted, harassed, and tyrannized. If a black person speaks against someone’s beliefs, and/or makes an insensitive comment nothing negative happens to them, blacks don’t even get called out on it. If and when a black person gets pulled over by the police everyone assumes it because “racism”. A black person can even be pointing a gun at the police, and people say it is because “racism”. If a white man does the same act, they are crazy, stupid, and a criminal. Blacks can, and do blame all their shortcomings on racism. Over 70% of black fathers do not take part in their children’s lives, and the same amount of mothers raise their children to become thugs, from “racism”? Ever since ‘affirmative affirmation’ took place more American have died, than all the U.S. wars combined at the hand of black thugs shooting guns, from “racism”? Anywhere you look on this planet, if the population makes up just 12% or more of the black race violence follows, from “racism”?\\n\\nPeople are so brainwashed by everything they see and hear, even our schools breed “racism” by teaching black victimization, and white privilege. Look up a man named Anthony Johnson and you will see that he was a free black man in America who owned black slaves. Johnson was the first American to even go to court and have his slave documented. Large numbers of free blacks owned some of the biggest plantations in America, which were operated by black slaves that they owned. Did I mention that only 1.4% of all Americans owned slaves? Not one of these facts is mentioned when our children learn about slavery because they want to teach hate. When you get down to it, slavery happened all over the world, to all races. Take a look at the 16th -18th century, it is estimated that 1.5 million Christian Europeans were enslaved in South Africa in the Barbary Slave Trade. Source - http://blog.encyclopediavirginia.org/2011/12/slavery-by-the-numbers/\\nThe media stepped in with their race baiting with Zimmerman, it is also factual that the media showed pictures of Zimmerman as a white man, even went so far as to lighten his pictures, and only showed pictures of  Trayvon from years before the actual incident. Here is the proof in that; https://youtu.be/qfcDIwky8lU\\nObama had a chance to step forward and put a stop to it all, but instead, he got on television, saying Trayvon could have been his son. People are so full of hate that they will not accept these truths. \\nI am telling you, people, we are all being used as sheep, controlled by television, Hollywood, schools, and our government. Who controls all these agendas? $$$$ Wake up, these elites are smart. We have repeated history, and will continue to do so if we do not WAKE UP!!! \\nIf you look into The Bell Curve you will find it scientifically proven that different races have different IQ's no matter where their environment. Yet, we are not allowed to speak about it because it's considered racist. So humanity is being held back and dumbed down. East Asians IQ's are higher than whites, and we can handle that and admit it, yet those who are unintelligent are less logical, more violent, etc..etc.. So these bastards behind the Banking system are feeding these animals white hatred, causing our people to pay for them to not only produce babies, but to make more than us, and they are forcing in millions with these low IQs into only the majority white nations around the world. \\n\\nThe United States alone accepts each year—from 70,000 Refugees in 2015 to 85,000 in 2016 and 100,000 in 2017—and scale up the number of Syrian refugees admitted to at least 10,000 for the current fiscal year, which began October 1. They are spreading them out, so it does not look Biblical. These “Refugees” do not care about our morals and values. They have not come here to help preserve our way of life, nor do they want to contribute positively to our society. We must realize that these people are being placed into any, and only the “majority white” countries around the world. If whites were any other race everyone would be calling this mass-genocide.\\nFollowing all this, if you look into the population in the once majority white nations around the globe compared to this banking system you will see that the banking system is/was doomed, and this is just one reason why we are watching all the immigrants come from these countries around the world. Think about it. If whites were being forced into Africa, so much so that the country's black population was now the minority. This monetary system enslaves us and turns us against one and other. https://youtu.be/mII9NZ8MMVM \\nOn June 4, 1963, Kennedy signed a virtually unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110. This order would strip the Federal Reserve of its power to loan money to the United States Federal Government at interest. November 22, 1963, JFK was assassinated. You all need to wake up and see what’s really going on. This monetary system has caused this. They want whites to be eliminated. They own, promote, and distribute everything we see on television, movies, stores, governments, countries, etc. Look it up, even without all the places this monetary system owns, they still have 99.9% of this planet.\\nJust think about the shows on television now compared to the ones back in the day. The ones back in the days had morals and values, and the shows that play now, like Shameless, project the unhealthy lifestyles to be grandiose. Look back and anyone can see the television has played a major role in society’s behavior. It is our duty to make this country safe for our children and their children. Why are we not uniting? Even our schooling system is spreading identity confusion. A big portion of young people do not even know which sex they are attracted to, and this system caused it all. Back when times were better one family member could work, make enough to take care of the whole house, and one parent could stay home to teach children morals and values to live by. They saw this and modified it. All we must do is unit while we still have the numbers. \\nSince President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in late 1963, more Americans have been killed by gunfire in this country than died in all U.S. wars. Not because of guns, but from black people. I believe it is safe to say it is the majority, and blacks need to stop blaming whites for everything the black race has become. You can look anywhere they are in the world if their numbers are at, or above 12%, Violence follows.\\n\\nThe rules, or principles that are unfairly applied in different ways towards the white people and what they believe in, is not applied in the same manner for any other race in this nation. We must come together and save what those before us have fought and died for, we must unite, taking back what is rightfully ours, our children's, and infinite generations after. Our state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on our way of life, behavior, and political views are now and have been taken away from our people. https://youtu.be/uMfk5UeGw4E \\n\\nAnyone can see we are wired differently, science proves this, yet we are not allowed to speak of it, because we are considered RACIST if we do. Look into The Bell Curve. This scientist won a Nobel Prize yet his life was ruined for speaking the truths. White’s better start figuring out what kind of place they want for their children, because it’s all going to shit, and this is not the time to be immobile. \\nThis country will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything. – M.G.P.",4,0

If your opponent, who is in a same position as you, hurls the ball into those zones, your left hand gets either slapped with a thick rubber band, heated with really hot air or zapped through the contacts.

b7xndvitLa8,"Born in the GDR in 1981, I am one of those people who suffered from the lack of video games in the early childhood. My first and only gaming experience before the fall of the iron curtain was a few minutes of River Raid (shown in this video). Even after the reunion it took me a little while (christmas 1991 to be exact) to get my first console (the SEGA Master System), because money was short for most former eastern germans and electronic was very expensive (an empty cassette tape for example costed 20 Mark which is around 40-50$ by today's standard) . For a whole year I had only Alex Kidd and Sonic to play, followed by Sonic 2 the next christmas. I'm not really sad about it because I learned to appreciate what I had instead of being jealous of what others had. It had a unique kind of fascination to try out a new game back then and that's what I'm missing today.\\nAfter all I (and the former GDR in general) quickly caught up with the latest technology and by the time the fifth generation of video games (N64, Playstation, Saturn) came we were on the same level as the rest of the world, if not earlier.\\nWe may have missed some precious childhood experiences back then, but we also learned to respect video games in a way most people didn't :)",0,0

The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons.

9chSjcOM5og,"Do you all not see that they brainwash you?\\nDo the people even know that the first man to legally own a slave in America was a BLACK man named Anthony Johnson? Look it up people education is everything today. Let us talk about privilege for a moment; As it all stands now, not one white person truly knows what it feels like to take pride in our own race without fear of being persecuted. If a white person is poor we are looked down on as being lazy, with blacks however it is because “racism”.  If a black person has money they are looked up to, but if their white has it then they are “spoon-feed”, or “exploiting others”. If a white commits a violent crime towards blacks they are “racist” and will be prosecuted to the fullest, but if a black against white crime happens it is “justified”. No white person alive “since 1961” has ever known what is like to get hired for a job over another race, because of our skin tone. With ‘affirmative action’ black children can go to private schools for free, but whites must pay, the same thing with colleges, the workforce, etc. When a white person commits a crime it is on every media outlet, but black flash mobs, gruesome murders, and all racist actions are covered by all media outlets. If a white person speaks anything against one's beliefs or makes an insensitive comment they now get fired, persecuted, harassed, and tyrannized. If a black person speaks against someone’s beliefs, and/or makes an insensitive comment nothing negative happens to them, blacks don’t even get called out on it. If and when a black person gets pulled over by the police everyone assumes it because “racism”. A black person can even be pointing a gun at the police, and people say it is because “racism”. If a white man does the same act, they are crazy, stupid, and a criminal. Blacks can, and do blame all their shortcomings on racism. Over 70% of black fathers do not take part in their children’s lives, and the same amount of mothers raise their children to become thugs, from “racism”? Ever since ‘affirmative affirmation’ took place more American have died, than all the U.S. wars combined at the hand of black thugs shooting guns, from “racism”? Anywhere you look on this planet, if the population makes up just 12% or more of the black race violence follows, from “racism”?\\n\\nPeople are so brainwashed by everything they see and hear, even our schools breed “racism” by teaching black victimization, and white privilege. Look up a man named Anthony Johnson and you will see that he was a free black man in America who owned black slaves. Johnson was the first American to even go to court and have his slave documented. Large numbers of free blacks owned some of the biggest plantations in America, which were operated by black slaves that they owned. Did I mention that only 1.4% of all Americans owned slaves? Not one of these facts is mentioned when our children learn about slavery because they want to teach hate. When you get down to it, slavery happened all over the world, to all races. Take a look at the 16th -18th century, it is estimated that 1.5 million Christian Europeans were enslaved in South Africa in the Barbary Slave Trade. Source - http://blog.encyclopediavirginia.org/2011/12/slavery-by-the-numbers/\\nThe media stepped in with their race baiting with Zimmerman, it is also factual that the media showed pictures of Zimmerman as a white man, even went so far as to lighten his pictures, and only showed pictures of  Trayvon from years before the actual incident. Here is the proof in that; https://youtu.be/qfcDIwky8lU\\nObama had a chance to step forward and put a stop to it all, but instead, he got on television, saying Trayvon could have been his son. People are so full of hate that they will not accept these truths. \\nI am telling you, people, we are all being used as sheep, controlled by television, Hollywood, schools, and our government. Who controls all these agendas? $$$$ Wake up, these elites are smart. We have repeated history, and will continue to do so if we do not WAKE UP!!! \\nIf you look into The Bell Curve you will find it scientifically proven that different races have different IQ's no matter where their environment. Yet, we are not allowed to speak about it because it's considered racist. So humanity is being held back and dumbed down. East Asians IQ's are higher than whites, and we can handle that and admit it, yet those who are unintelligent are less logical, more violent, etc..etc.. So these bastards behind the Banking system are feeding these animals white hatred, causing our people to pay for them to not only produce babies, but to make more than us, and they are forcing in millions with these low IQs into only the majority white nations around the world. \\n\\nThe United States alone accepts each year—from 70,000 Refugees in 2015 to 85,000 in 2016 and 100,000 in 2017—and scale up the number of Syrian refugees admitted to at least 10,000 for the current fiscal year, which began October 1. They are spreading them out, so it does not look Biblical. These “Refugees” do not care about our morals and values. They have not come here to help preserve our way of life, nor do they want to contribute positively to our society. We must realize that these people are being placed into any, and only the “majority white” countries around the world. If whites were any other race everyone would be calling this mass-genocide.\\nFollowing all this, if you look into the population in the once majority white nations around the globe compared to this banking system you will see that the banking system is/was doomed, and this is just one reason why we are watching all the immigrants come from these countries around the world. Think about it. If whites were being forced into Africa, so much so that the country's black population was now the minority. This monetary system enslaves us and turns us against one and other. https://youtu.be/mII9NZ8MMVM \\nOn June 4, 1963, Kennedy signed a virtually unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110. This order would strip the Federal Reserve of its power to loan money to the United States Federal Government at interest. November 22, 1963, JFK was assassinated. You all need to wake up and see what’s really going on. This monetary system has caused this. They want whites to be eliminated. They own, promote, and distribute everything we see on television, movies, stores, governments, countries, etc. Look it up, even without all the places this monetary system owns, they still have 99.9% of this planet.\\nJust think about the shows on television now compared to the ones back in the day. The ones back in the days had morals and values, and the shows that play now, like Shameless, project the unhealthy lifestyles to be grandiose. Look back and anyone can see the television has played a major role in society’s behavior. It is our duty to make this country safe for our children and their children. Why are we not uniting? Even our schooling system is spreading identity confusion. A big portion of young people do not even know which sex they are attracted to, and this system caused it all. Back when times were better one family member could work, make enough to take care of the whole house, and one parent could stay home to teach children morals and values to live by. They saw this and modified it. All we must do is unit while we still have the numbers. \\nSince President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in late 1963, more Americans have been killed by gunfire in this country than died in all U.S. wars. Not because of guns, but from black people. I believe it is safe to say it is the majority, and blacks need to stop blaming whites for everything the black race has become. You can look anywhere they are in the world if their numbers are at, or above 12%, Violence follows.\\n\\nThe rules, or principles that are unfairly applied in different ways towards the white people and what they believe in, is not applied in the same manner for any other race in this nation. We must come together and save what those before us have fought and died for, we must unite, taking back what is rightfully ours, our children's, and infinite generations after. Our state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on our way of life, behavior, and political views are now and have been taken away from our people. https://youtu.be/uMfk5UeGw4E \\n\\nAnyone can see we are wired differently, science proves this, yet we are not allowed to speak of it, because we are considered RACIST if we do. Look into The Bell Curve. This scientist won a Nobel Prize yet his life was ruined for speaking the truths. White’s better start figuring out what kind of place they want for their children, because it’s all going to shit, and this is not the time to be immobile. \\nThis country will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything. – M.G.P.",4,0

b7xndvitLa8,"Born in the GDR in 1981, I am one of those people who suffered from the lack of video games in the early childhood. My first and only gaming experience before the fall of the iron curtain was a few minutes of River Raid (shown in this video). Even after the reunion it took me a little while (christmas 1991 to be exact) to get my first console (the SEGA Master System), because money was short for most former eastern germans and electronic was very expensive (an empty cassette tape for example costed 20 Mark which is around 40-50$ by today's standard) . For a whole year I had only Alex Kidd and Sonic to play, followed by Sonic 2 the next christmas. I'm not really sad about it because I learned to appreciate what I had instead of being jealous of what others had. It had a unique kind of fascination to try out a new game back then and that's what I'm missing today.\\nAfter all I (and the former GDR in general) quickly caught up with the latest technology and by the time the fifth generation of video games (N64, Playstation, Saturn) came we were on the same level as the rest of the world, if not earlier.\\nWe may have missed some precious childhood experiences back then, but we also learned to respect video games in a way most people didn't :)",0,0

At these times on flea markets you could get many games (of course pirated but back then in Poland were not defined anti-piracy law) therefore we could play many different games from the west.

Go to ‘youtube’ and type in “U2 The Fly ZooTV” be prepared to pause. When it says “Everything You Know Is Wrong” hit pause. To re-enforce this concept go to ‘youtube’ and type in “Alternative Views George Seldes” and be prepared to pause. Shortly into the video he says “History is a lie agreed upon” and atributes it to Napolean Bonaparte. Next go to ‘youtube’ and type in “1984 full movie”. At the beginning of the version with John Hurt it states ‘Who Controls The Past Controls The Future, Who Controls The Present Controls The Past”. Thats all you need to know. Lets establish a conspiracy. Go to ‘Amazon’ and type in “New World Order by H G Wells” and search in books. You will find a book published in 1940 about global government. Then go to ‘google’ and type in “New World Order by H G Wells free pdf”. It’s free on the internet. Next go to ‘Wikipedia’ and type in “H G Wells”. You will discover he was a well known science fiction writer who died about 1945. He wrote “The Invisible Man”, “The War Of The Worlds” and “The Time Machine” which were all made into movies. “The War Of The Worlds” became very famous in 1939 when Orson Wells (no relation) caused a panic in New Jersey with his radio broadcast of this book. Reading about H G Wells at ‘Wikipedia’ you will discover he was a member of The Fabian Society a socialist organization started in the 1880’s. The stated goal of this group is the slow implementation of a global government. The word ‘fabian’ comes from a Roman general who defeated Hannibal. “Fabian” was a Rock N Roll singer of the late 1950’s. He was proof positive you don’t need any talent to make it in music. Return to ‘youtube’ and type in “Won’t Get Fooled Again” by The Who. Anyone who has listened to Rock N Roll since 1969 when this song came out has heard it a million times. Next go to ‘youtube’ and type in “Everybody Wants To Rule The World” by Tears For Fears. This song came out in 1985 and has been played a million times. At one point he says “Say that you’l never never need it,…one headline why believe it”. Go to ‘youtube’ type in “N W O” by Ministry. One of the best bands nobody has ever heard of. The title speaks for itself. Go to ‘youtube’ type in “The Saints Are Coming” by U2/Green Day. A little obscure but has elements of mind control. They say “No matter how I try I realize there’s no reply”. There’s no point in trying to talk to anyone you believe is under mind control. This includes anyone who has been in the military. Lets go down the mind control road. Go to ‘youtube’ type in “Manchurian Candidate”. Pick the one with Frank Sinatra that came out around 1960 and watch the beginning. Next go to ‘youtube’ and type in ‘Jose Delgado and His Bull Story”. You will get a ten minute video about Jose Delgado and how he stopped a bull in a bull fighting ring with a push button. This happened about 1965. He called his device a ‘Stimociever”. I don’t think Delgado invented the technology, I think it already existed and he was trying to expose it. Go to ‘google’ and type in “Physical Control Of The Mind: Toward A Psycho Social Society” by Jose Manuel DelGado. He wrote this book about 1970. It is not a medical book. It is written for the layman. The beginning covers ethical and moral questions surrounding mind control and mentions someone named Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, a Jesuit priest who died in 1955. Chardin was portrayed in the movie “The Exorcist”. Del Gado details 2 types of mind control. One is a chip slipped under the scalp that communicates with the inner ear and the other is Endoscopic Pituitary surgery. The chip under the scalp can just be broken with a hammer if you’re careful and the Pituitary can be disabled with ECT (Electro Convulsive Therapy). Electricity to the head.Lets see what Rock N Roll has to say about voices in the head. Go to ‘youtube’ and look at the following 1. I Don’t Like Mondays by The Boomtown Rats 2. Voices Inside My Head by The Police 3. The Kiss by The Cure This will get you started.\\n\\nInstructions for a chain letter. Copy and paste the text above into a word processing program. Save file to hard drive. Print ten copies. Snail mail one of the copies to each of ten friends. Instruct them to do the same. Or use email.\\n\\nTwo non violent things people can do to bring down the system. Don’t join the military and don’t join the priesthood.\\n\\nThis is some advice for anyone who has one of my cd’s/dvd’s or printed material. Trying to keep secrets is hopeless and counter productive. There is safety in numbers. If a million people know something in 24 hrs it defeats the system. This was the basic concept behind mass media in the beginning. If you can’t email it somehow use should snail mail like a chain letter. Make as many copies as you can, mail them to different people and have them do the same. If some idea is actually worth money but it fights the ‘system’ it isn’t going anywhere so you might as well give it away.\\n\\nPhilip Nute\\n451 Quincy Ave\\nBraintree MA 02184\\nwww.philipnute.wordpress.com",0,0

9chSjcOM5og,"Do you all not see that they brainwash you?\\nDo the people even know that the first man to legally own a slave in America was a BLACK man named Anthony Johnson? Look it up people education is everything today. Let us talk about privilege for a moment; As it all stands now, not one white person truly knows what it feels like to take pride in our own race without fear of being persecuted. If a white person is poor we are looked down on as being lazy, with blacks however it is because “racism”.  If a black person has money they are looked up to, but if their white has it then they are “spoon-feed”, or “exploiting others”. If a white commits a violent crime towards blacks they are “racist” and will be prosecuted to the fullest, but if a black against white crime happens it is “justified”. No white person alive “since 1961” has ever known what is like to get hired for a job over another race, because of our skin tone. With ‘affirmative action’ black children can go to private schools for free, but whites must pay, the same thing with colleges, the workforce, etc. When a white person commits a crime it is on every media outlet, but black flash mobs, gruesome murders, and all racist actions are covered by all media outlets. If a white person speaks anything against one's beliefs or makes an insensitive comment they now get fired, persecuted, harassed, and tyrannized. If a black person speaks against someone’s beliefs, and/or makes an insensitive comment nothing negative happens to them, blacks don’t even get called out on it. If and when a black person gets pulled over by the police everyone assumes it because “racism”. A black person can even be pointing a gun at the police, and people say it is because “racism”. If a white man does the same act, they are crazy, stupid, and a criminal. Blacks can, and do blame all their shortcomings on racism. Over 70% of black fathers do not take part in their children’s lives, and the same amount of mothers raise their children to become thugs, from “racism”? Ever since ‘affirmative affirmation’ took place more American have died, than all the U.S. wars combined at the hand of black thugs shooting guns, from “racism”? Anywhere you look on this planet, if the population makes up just 12% or more of the black race violence follows, from “racism”?\\n\\nPeople are so brainwashed by everything they see and hear, even our schools breed “racism” by teaching black victimization, and white privilege. Look up a man named Anthony Johnson and you will see that he was a free black man in America who owned black slaves. Johnson was the first American to even go to court and have his slave documented. Large numbers of free blacks owned some of the biggest plantations in America, which were operated by black slaves that they owned. Did I mention that only 1.4% of all Americans owned slaves? Not one of these facts is mentioned when our children learn about slavery because they want to teach hate. When you get down to it, slavery happened all over the world, to all races. Take a look at the 16th -18th century, it is estimated that 1.5 million Christian Europeans were enslaved in South Africa in the Barbary Slave Trade. Source - http://blog.encyclopediavirginia.org/2011/12/slavery-by-the-numbers/\\nThe media stepped in with their race baiting with Zimmerman, it is also factual that the media showed pictures of Zimmerman as a white man, even went so far as to lighten his pictures, and only showed pictures of  Trayvon from years before the actual incident. Here is the proof in that; https://youtu.be/qfcDIwky8lU\\nObama had a chance to step forward and put a stop to it all, but instead, he got on television, saying Trayvon could have been his son. People are so full of hate that they will not accept these truths. \\nI am telling you, people, we are all being used as sheep, controlled by television, Hollywood, schools, and our government. Who controls all these agendas? $$$$ Wake up, these elites are smart. We have repeated history, and will continue to do so if we do not WAKE UP!!! \\nIf you look into The Bell Curve you will find it scientifically proven that different races have different IQ's no matter where their environment. Yet, we are not allowed to speak about it because it's considered racist. So humanity is being held back and dumbed down. East Asians IQ's are higher than whites, and we can handle that and admit it, yet those who are unintelligent are less logical, more violent, etc..etc.. So these bastards behind the Banking system are feeding these animals white hatred, causing our people to pay for them to not only produce babies, but to make more than us, and they are forcing in millions with these low IQs into only the majority white nations around the world. \\n\\nThe United States alone accepts each year—from 70,000 Refugees in 2015 to 85,000 in 2016 and 100,000 in 2017—and scale up the number of Syrian refugees admitted to at least 10,000 for the current fiscal year, which began October 1. They are spreading them out, so it does not look Biblical. These “Refugees” do not care about our morals and values. They have not come here to help preserve our way of life, nor do they want to contribute positively to our society. We must realize that these people are being placed into any, and only the “majority white” countries around the world. If whites were any other race everyone would be calling this mass-genocide.\\nFollowing all this, if you look into the population in the once majority white nations around the globe compared to this banking system you will see that the banking system is/was doomed, and this is just one reason why we are watching all the immigrants come from these countries around the world. Think about it. If whites were being forced into Africa, so much so that the country's black population was now the minority. This monetary system enslaves us and turns us against one and other. https://youtu.be/mII9NZ8MMVM \\nOn June 4, 1963, Kennedy signed a virtually unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110. This order would strip the Federal Reserve of its power to loan money to the United States Federal Government at interest. November 22, 1963, JFK was assassinated. You all need to wake up and see what’s really going on. This monetary system has caused this. They want whites to be eliminated. They own, promote, and distribute everything we see on television, movies, stores, governments, countries, etc. Look it up, even without all the places this monetary system owns, they still have 99.9% of this planet.\\nJust think about the shows on television now compared to the ones back in the day. The ones back in the days had morals and values, and the shows that play now, like Shameless, project the unhealthy lifestyles to be grandiose. Look back and anyone can see the television has played a major role in society’s behavior. It is our duty to make this country safe for our children and their children. Why are we not uniting? Even our schooling system is spreading identity confusion. A big portion of young people do not even know which sex they are attracted to, and this system caused it all. Back when times were better one family member could work, make enough to take care of the whole house, and one parent could stay home to teach children morals and values to live by. They saw this and modified it. All we must do is unit while we still have the numbers. \\nSince President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in late 1963, more Americans have been killed by gunfire in this country than died in all U.S. wars. Not because of guns, but from black people. I believe it is safe to say it is the majority, and blacks need to stop blaming whites for everything the black race has become. You can look anywhere they are in the world if their numbers are at, or above 12%, Violence follows.\\n\\nThe rules, or principles that are unfairly applied in different ways towards the white people and what they believe in, is not applied in the same manner for any other race in this nation. We must come together and save what those before us have fought and died for, we must unite, taking back what is rightfully ours, our children's, and infinite generations after. Our state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on our way of life, behavior, and political views are now and have been taken away from our people. https://youtu.be/uMfk5UeGw4E \\n\\nAnyone can see we are wired differently, science proves this, yet we are not allowed to speak of it, because we are considered RACIST if we do. Look into The Bell Curve. This scientist won a Nobel Prize yet his life was ruined for speaking the truths. White’s better start figuring out what kind of place they want for their children, because it’s all going to shit, and this is not the time to be immobile. \\nThis country will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything. – M.G.P.",4,0

Yellow vs neutral vs rose 🙏 I know I've already commented on this some time ago, and maybe this could be a great video idea when you're on Accutane and don't want to put foundation on your face - you could just show us swatches in your arms when first applied, some minutes after and maybe some more time after, to see if it'll oxidize and which shade it will be considering the foundation's undertone.

pGVtDzMDJ0I,I've been using the Wunder 2 60 second wrinkle reducer on my 54 year old under eye bags.  I like it for the lift it gives my bags but it doesn't blend that well.  Wish there was another option.  I like though that it dries to a slight sheen (mimicking the look of younger skin) so I'll keep using it.  :) Good luck with the Acutane.  Me and my 3 kids were all on it.  It helps but really dries you out and causes some bone aches which will go away.  One of my kids was on it twice.,0,0

Wish there was another option.  I like though that it dries to a slight sheen (mimicking the look of younger skin) so I'll keep using it.  :) Good luck with the Acutane.  Me and my 3 kids were all on it.  It helps but really dries you out and causes some bone aches which will go away.  One of my kids was on it twice.,0,0

dy5xLVx2NGY,"This fucking beast fell 18,000 feet and sprained his fucking leg....\\n\\nFrom Wikipedia\\n\\nOn the night of 24 March 1944, 21-year-old Alkemade was one of seven crew members in Avro Lancaster B Mk. II, DS664, of No. 115 Squadron RAF. Returning from a 300 bomber raid on Berlin, east of Schmallenberg, DS664 was attacked by a German Ju 88 night-fighter, caught fire and began to spiral out of control. Because his parachute was unserviceable, Alkemade jumped from the aircraft without one, preferring to die by impact rather than burn to death. He fell 18,000 feet (5,500 m) to the ground below.\\n\\nHis fall was broken by pine trees and a soft snow cover on the ground. He was able to move his arms and legs and suffered only a sprained leg. The Lancaster crashed in flames, killing pilot Jack Newman and three other members of the crew. They are buried in the CWGC's Hanover War Cemetery.\\n\\nAlkemade was subsequently captured and interviewed by the Gestapo, who were initially suspicious of his claim to have fallen without a parachute until the wreckage of the aircraft was examined. (Reportedly, the Germans gave Alkemade a certificate testifying to the fact.) He was a celebrated prisoner of war, before being repatriated in May 1945.",0,0

Yellow vs neutral vs rose 🙏 I know I've already commented on this some time ago, and maybe this could be a great video idea when you're on Accutane and don't want to put foundation on your face - you could just show us swatches in your arms when first applied, some minutes after and maybe some more time after, to see if it'll oxidize and which shade it will be considering the foundation's undertone.

pGVtDzMDJ0I,I've been using the Wunder 2 60 second wrinkle reducer on my 54 year old under eye bags.  I like it for the lift it gives my bags but it doesn't blend that well.  Wish there was another option.  I like though that it dries to a slight sheen (mimicking the look of younger skin) so I'll keep using it.  :) Good luck with the Acutane.  Me and my 3 kids were all on it.  It helps but really dries you out and causes some bone aches which will go away.  One of my kids was on it twice.,0,0

dy5xLVx2NGY,"I survived a dual malfunction.  It was a night jump at Fryar DZ on Ft Benning with 3rd Bat.  It was supposed to be a simple jump and assemble.  I stepped out of the C-130 and counted to four one thousand and felt no opening shock.  There was very little lum, but I quickly ascertained that I was upside down and my canopy was in a cigarette roll.  My left riser was wrapped around my crotch, continuing up behind me (an investigation decided that I failed to maintain a tight enough body posture and had done an aerial somersault as my suspension lines were unravelling out of the pack tray).  Following my training for actions in the air, I deployed my reserve (more accurately, attempted to deploy).  I yanked out the handle, and the tray of my reserve sprung open, however since I was upside down and spinning, the canopy failed to spring away from me and just got wrapped around my body.  Continuing on with my actions in the air, I grabbed as much of the reserve that I could and threw it in the direction that I was spinning.  This rendered the same result of the reserve canopy just wrapping around me in a jumbled mess.  I now had two fucked up canopies and was racing toward the ground in almost complete darkness.  I looked up at my cigarette rolled main and decided that it was my best chance for survival.  At least the suspension lines had made it out of the pack tray, even if they were strangling the air out of it.  I did my best to put outward pressure on my risers, given my strange position, and proceeded to do a modified bicycle kick.  I essentially just kicked as wildly as humanly possible.  Miraculously, I spun out and my canopy opened about 200 feet from the ground (as relayed to me by cadre who were watching the jump through NODs).  I do say miraculously, because I'm 100 percent convinced that God saved my life.",0,0

sOfbbmUh8CA,"While\\n most cat owners are tuned in to the little details and quirks of their \\ncat’s personality — like their ability to open a door or proclivity for \\nattacking feet at night — it can be difficult to determine when \\nbehaviors that seem unusual are signs of a deeper health concern. If \\nyou're questioning what is wrong with your cat, here’s a look at some of\\n the ways cats hide their pain, common conditions they suffer from, and \\nhow to get your cat the care he needs.\\n \\nHow Cats Hide Discomfort\\n \\n“Whether or not cats hide their pain all depends on the problem,” \\nsays Susan O’Bell, DVM at the Angell Animal Medical Center in Boston, \\nMass. One common problem that brings cats to the veterinarian or \\nemergency room is signs of a lower urinary tract infection that have gone undiagnosed.\\n \\n“Cats with this affliction can be impacted in a variety of ways, from\\n mild discomfort to a life threatening inability to pass urine,” Dr. \\nO’Bell says. “This manifests from a few unnoticed extra trips to the \\nlitter box, some mild malaise for a day or two or the ever-frustrating urination occurring outside of the litter box.”\\n \\nMore obvious signs of a urinary tract infection include licking at the genital area, vomiting or extreme lethargy.\\n It is possible, however, to see no outward signs of pain or illness in \\ncats until they’ve begun losing weight or have a decreased appetite — \\nsomething that’s difficult to monitor if you have multiple cats or if \\nyour cat doesn’t eat voraciously when healthy.\\n \\n“I suspect the will to hide weakness originates from their ‘big cat’ \\nancestors, who would have been last to eat, find a mate, or be left \\nbehind if unable to keep up with their pride,” Dr. O’Bell says. “One of \\nmy own cats ended up being diagnosed with a serious gastrointestinal ailment having had no initial outward symptoms.”\\n \\n“In addition to a decreased appetite and inappropriate elimination \\n(of both urine and feces), cats may hide symptoms of an illness with \\nclingy behavior or hiding, increased vocalization, aggression, vomiting \\nand a change in their attitude or demeanor,” Dr. O’Bell says. Whether \\none, all or a combination of these behaviors is prevalent, your \\nveterinarian will need a thorough history of your cat’s personality and \\nnormal behavior, medical records and additional diagnostics like lab \\nwork to get a better idea of the problem.\\n \\nCommon Cat Ailments\\n \\nAccording to Dr. O’Bell, changes in weight and signs of periodontal disease\\n are the top two health concerns to recognize and look out for when it \\ncomes to cats. Brushing your cat’s teeth or even taking a peek in their \\nmouth on a weekly basis will help you spot signs of infection or areas \\nof concern before they become life-threatening. “Unfortunately, obesity \\nhas become an epidemic\\n among domestic cats because many owners don’t recognize their cat’s \\nweight being a health concern,” Dr. O’Bell says. Obesity poses a risk \\nfor diabetes in your cat, and puts strain on their joints, liver and \\nkidneys. Conversely, drastic weight loss is something to lookout for and\\n will prompt your veterinarian to screen your cat for health concerns \\nwith blood work, a biochemistry panel and a urine test.\\n \\nAdditional under-recognized health concerns include arthritis and hyperthyroidism.\\n While it’s easier to recognize arthritis or orthopedic abnormalities in\\n dogs, cats may hide signs of discomfort. If your cat hesitates before \\nmaking a jump or their coat has lost some of its luster,\\n it may be because they are having difficulty moving or grooming \\nthemselves. Cats with arthritis may also eliminate outside of the litter\\n box because they’re unable to jump inside of it.\\n \\n“Hyperthyroidism is often diagnosed in advanced stages because early \\nsymptoms may seem like signs of good health like a good appetite, high \\nenergy and slight weight loss,” Dr, O’Bell says. “Kidney disease in cats\\n is also common, and its presence may be masked by hyperthyroidism.”\\n \\n“Many cats can compensate for their chronic kidney disease by simply \\nincreasing their water intake to keep themselves hydrated,” Dr. O’Bell \\nadds. “This could go on for months or even years, and may only have \\novertly detected symptoms when the disease is already quite advanced.”\\n \\nHow to Help Your Cat Cope\\n \\nAs with most health conditions, early detection is key to achieving \\nbetter outcomes with your cat. Diagnosing kidney disease in cats early \\nand making the appropriate changes in their diet with specialized food \\ncan help manage their condition and lead to a longer survival rate. \\nUnderstanding your cat’s kidney disease will also help you to recognize \\nsigns of dehydration, a common complication, earlier on that if the disease was left undiagnosed.\\n \\nBy either hiding their symptoms completely or refusing medicine, cats\\n are particularly difficult patients to treat. “Fortunately,” says Dr. \\nO’Bell, “there are a variety of diagnostic aids and advanced treatments \\navailable to cats that can help their owners keep them healthy.”\\n \\nAsk your veterinarian about the different forms of medication \\navailable to you (liquid, tablet, gel, injection) and find the best fit \\nfor your cat. You’ll also want to ask about the different types of food \\navailable to help your cat manage their condition, and experiment with \\ndifferent brands until you find one that they like. Changes in helping \\nyour cat cope may be quick and easy or take a bit more time, but with \\npatience, you’ll be able to find something that works.\\n \\n“For some cats, simply the addition of a second litter box is enough \\nto please them,” Dr. O’Bell says. “For others, a short or long-term \\nprescription of mood-stabilizing drugs can be life saving.”\\n \\nPreventive care that includes annual visits to your veterinarian, \\nfeeding your cat a nutritionally balanced diet to maintain their weight,\\n maintaining an easily accessible and clean litter box and providing \\nyour cat multiple sources of fresh water are also essential in keeping \\nyour cat healthy and will help curb any major behavioral or medical \\nissues.\\n \\n \\nImage: Okssi / via Shutterstock\\n \\n \\nMore to Explore\\n \\nCat Scratching?

pGVtDzMDJ0I,I've been using the Wunder 2 60 second wrinkle reducer on my 54 year old under eye bags.  I like it for the lift it gives my bags but it doesn't blend that well.  Wish there was another option.  I like though that it dries to a slight sheen (mimicking the look of younger skin) so I'll keep using it.  :) Good luck with the Acutane.  Me and my 3 kids were all on it.  It helps but really dries you out and causes some bone aches which will go away.  One of my kids was on it twice.,0,0

Unfortunately, the bullying in this video depicted is painfully obvious and the majority of people still did nothing... So I could see how this behavior will be overlooked in real life situations. I was bullied, but as you get older you realize that the people that are doing that often have more problems then you. It's sad how other people can be some of the biggest obstacles in life.",0,0

mnKPEsbTo9s,"while i agree this sends a great message, I also have this opinion that you shouldnt stop a bully. Kids need to learn how to stand up to bullies on their own, or at least get guidance on how to. the learning experience of a bully is HUGE is helping adolescence mature into more stable secure individuals. without this, kids may grow to be meak adults, having never stood up for themselves.  Granted some kids simply never will stand up for themselves and they grow up angry or scared , but they need to be coached on how to stand up to bullies. I was bullied as a kid and hated it, until i learned to stand up to them. It was one of the greatest, eye opening experiences of my life and to this day thank the lord that i was bullied AND learned to stand up for myself.

If you're a bully you're a little bitch who needs to get their shit pushed back. But for real, doing nothing is worse. People need to take a stand for themselves as well. If you can defend yourself-- do it, be brave and stand up for yourself. Have some self respect, some self worth-- don't lay down for bullies, even if it means you'll get your ass kicked you'll be a stronger person, I guarantee it.",0,1

sOfbbmUh8CA,"While\\n most cat owners are tuned in to the little details and quirks of their \\ncat’s personality — like their ability to open a door or proclivity for \\nattacking feet at night — it can be difficult to determine when \\nbehaviors that seem unusual are signs of a deeper health concern. If \\nyou're questioning what is wrong with your cat, here’s a look at some of\\n the ways cats hide their pain, common conditions they suffer from, and \\nhow to get your cat the care he needs.\\n \\nHow Cats Hide Discomfort\\n \\n“Whether or not cats hide their pain all depends on the problem,” \\nsays Susan O’Bell, DVM at the Angell Animal Medical Center in Boston, \\nMass. One common problem that brings cats to the veterinarian or \\nemergency room is signs of a lower urinary tract infection that have gone undiagnosed.\\n \\n“Cats with this affliction can be impacted in a variety of ways, from\\n mild discomfort to a life threatening inability to pass urine,” Dr. \\nO’Bell says. “This manifests from a few unnoticed extra trips to the \\nlitter box, some mild malaise for a day or two or the ever-frustrating urination occurring outside of the litter box.”\\n \\nMore obvious signs of a urinary tract infection include licking at the genital area, vomiting or extreme lethargy.\\n It is possible, however, to see no outward signs of pain or illness in \\ncats until they’ve begun losing weight or have a decreased appetite — \\nsomething that’s difficult to monitor if you have multiple cats or if \\nyour cat doesn’t eat voraciously when healthy.\\n \\n“I suspect the will to hide weakness originates from their ‘big cat’ \\nancestors, who would have been last to eat, find a mate, or be left \\nbehind if unable to keep up with their pride,” Dr. O’Bell says. “One of \\nmy own cats ended up being diagnosed with a serious gastrointestinal ailment having had no initial outward symptoms.”\\n \\n“In addition to a decreased appetite and inappropriate elimination \\n(of both urine and feces), cats may hide symptoms of an illness with \\nclingy behavior or hiding, increased vocalization, aggression, vomiting \\nand a change in their attitude or demeanor,” Dr. O’Bell says. Whether \\none, all or a combination of these behaviors is prevalent, your \\nveterinarian will need a thorough history of your cat’s personality and \\nnormal behavior, medical records and additional diagnostics like lab \\nwork to get a better idea of the problem.\\n \\nCommon Cat Ailments\\n \\nAccording to Dr. O’Bell, changes in weight and signs of periodontal disease\\n are the top two health concerns to recognize and look out for when it \\ncomes to cats. Brushing your cat’s teeth or even taking a peek in their \\nmouth on a weekly basis will help you spot signs of infection or areas \\nof concern before they become life-threatening. “Unfortunately, obesity \\nhas become an epidemic\\n among domestic cats because many owners don’t recognize their cat’s \\nweight being a health concern,” Dr. O’Bell says. Obesity poses a risk \\nfor diabetes in your cat, and puts strain on their joints, liver and \\nkidneys. Conversely, drastic weight loss is something to lookout for and\\n will prompt your veterinarian to screen your cat for health concerns \\nwith blood work, a biochemistry panel and a urine test.\\n \\nAdditional under-recognized health concerns include arthritis and hyperthyroidism.\\n While it’s easier to recognize arthritis or orthopedic abnormalities in\\n dogs, cats may hide signs of discomfort. If your cat hesitates before \\nmaking a jump or their coat has lost some of its luster,\\n it may be because they are having difficulty moving or grooming \\nthemselves. Cats with arthritis may also eliminate outside of the litter\\n box because they’re unable to jump inside of it.\\n \\n“Hyperthyroidism is often diagnosed in advanced stages because early \\nsymptoms may seem like signs of good health like a good appetite, high \\nenergy and slight weight loss,” Dr, O’Bell says. “Kidney disease in cats\\n is also common, and its presence may be masked by hyperthyroidism.”\\n \\n“Many cats can compensate for their chronic kidney disease by simply \\nincreasing their water intake to keep themselves hydrated,” Dr. O’Bell \\nadds. “This could go on for months or even years, and may only have \\novertly detected symptoms when the disease is already quite advanced.”\\n \\nHow to Help Your Cat Cope\\n \\nAs with most health conditions, early detection is key to achieving \\nbetter outcomes with your cat. Diagnosing kidney disease in cats early \\nand making the appropriate changes in their diet with specialized food \\ncan help manage their condition and lead to a longer survival rate. \\nUnderstanding your cat’s kidney disease will also help you to recognize \\nsigns of dehydration, a common complication, earlier on that if the disease was left undiagnosed.\\n \\nBy either hiding their symptoms completely or refusing medicine, cats\\n are particularly difficult patients to treat. “Fortunately,” says Dr. \\nO’Bell, “there are a variety of diagnostic aids and advanced treatments \\navailable to cats that can help their owners keep them healthy.”\\n \\nAsk your veterinarian about the different forms of medication \\navailable to you (liquid, tablet, gel, injection) and find the best fit \\nfor your cat. You’ll also want to ask about the different types of food \\navailable to help your cat manage their condition, and experiment with \\ndifferent brands until you find one that they like. Changes in helping \\nyour cat cope may be quick and easy or take a bit more time, but with \\npatience, you’ll be able to find something that works.\\n \\n“For some cats, simply the addition of a second litter box is enough \\nto please them,” Dr. O’Bell says. “For others, a short or long-term \\nprescription of mood-stabilizing drugs can be life saving.”\\n \\nPreventive care that includes annual visits to your veterinarian, \\nfeeding your cat a nutritionally balanced diet to maintain their weight,\\n maintaining an easily accessible and clean litter box and providing \\nyour cat multiple sources of fresh water are also essential in keeping \\nyour cat healthy and will help curb any major behavioral or medical \\nissues.\\n \\n \\nImage: Okssi / via Shutterstock\\n \\n \\nMore to Explore\\n \\nCat Scratching?

mnKPEsbTo9s,"while i agree this sends a great message, I also have this opinion that you shouldnt stop a bully. Kids need to learn how to stand up to bullies on their own, or at least get guidance on how to. the learning experience of a bully is HUGE is helping adolescence mature into more stable secure individuals. without this, kids may grow to be meak adults, having never stood up for themselves.  Granted some kids simply never will stand up for themselves and they grow up angry or scared , but they need to be coached on how to stand up to bullies. I was bullied as a kid and hated it, until i learned to stand up to them. It was one of the greatest, eye opening experiences of my life and to this day thank the lord that i was bullied AND learned to stand up for myself. I equate it to your first kiss. youre scared as hell but once you do it its the best feeling in the world. you spend the next few days euphoric!",0,0

sOfbbmUh8CA,"While\\n most cat owners are tuned in to the little details and quirks of their \\ncat’s personality — like their ability to open a door or proclivity for \\nattacking feet at night — it can be difficult to determine when \\nbehaviors that seem unusual are signs of a deeper health concern. If \\nyou're questioning what is wrong with your cat, here’s a look at some of\\n the ways cats hide their pain, common conditions they suffer from, and \\nhow to get your cat the care he needs.\\n \\nHow Cats Hide Discomfort\\n \\n“Whether or not cats hide their pain all depends on the problem,” \\nsays Susan O’Bell, DVM at the Angell Animal Medical Center in Boston, \\nMass. One common problem that brings cats to the veterinarian or \\nemergency room is signs of a lower urinary tract infection that have gone undiagnosed.\\n \\n“Cats with this affliction can be impacted in a variety of ways, from\\n mild discomfort to a life threatening inability to pass urine,” Dr. \\nO’Bell says. “This manifests from a few unnoticed extra trips to the \\nlitter box, some mild malaise for a day or two or the ever-frustrating urination occurring outside of the litter box.”\\n \\nMore obvious signs of a urinary tract infection include licking at the genital area, vomiting or extreme lethargy.\\n It is possible, however, to see no outward signs of pain or illness in \\ncats until they’ve begun losing weight or have a decreased appetite — \\nsomething that’s difficult to monitor if you have multiple cats or if \\nyour cat doesn’t eat voraciously when healthy.\\n \\n“I suspect the will to hide weakness originates from their ‘big cat’ \\nancestors, who would have been last to eat, find a mate, or be left \\nbehind if unable to keep up with their pride,” Dr. O’Bell says. “One of \\nmy own cats ended up being diagnosed with a serious gastrointestinal ailment having had no initial outward symptoms.”\\n \\n“In addition to a decreased appetite and inappropriate elimination \\n(of both urine and feces), cats may hide symptoms of an illness with \\nclingy behavior or hiding, increased vocalization, aggression, vomiting \\nand a change in their attitude or demeanor,” Dr. O’Bell says. Whether \\none, all or a combination of these behaviors is prevalent, your \\nveterinarian will need a thorough history of your cat’s personality and \\nnormal behavior, medical records and additional diagnostics like lab \\nwork to get a better idea of the problem.\\n \\nCommon Cat Ailments\\n \\nAccording to Dr. O’Bell, changes in weight and signs of periodontal disease\\n are the top two health concerns to recognize and look out for when it \\ncomes to cats. Brushing your cat’s teeth or even taking a peek in their \\nmouth on a weekly basis will help you spot signs of infection or areas \\nof concern before they become life-threatening. “Unfortunately, obesity \\nhas become an epidemic\\n among domestic cats because many owners don’t recognize their cat’s \\nweight being a health concern,” Dr. O’Bell says. Obesity poses a risk \\nfor diabetes in your cat, and puts strain on their joints, liver and \\nkidneys. Conversely, drastic weight loss is something to lookout for and\\n will prompt your veterinarian to screen your cat for health concerns \\nwith blood work, a biochemistry panel and a urine test.\\n \\nAdditional under-recognized health concerns include arthritis and hyperthyroidism.\\n While it’s easier to recognize arthritis or orthopedic abnormalities in\\n dogs, cats may hide signs of discomfort. If your cat hesitates before \\nmaking a jump or their coat has lost some of its luster,\\n it may be because they are having difficulty moving or grooming \\nthemselves. Cats with arthritis may also eliminate outside of the litter\\n box because they’re unable to jump inside of it.\\n \\n“Hyperthyroidism is often diagnosed in advanced stages because early \\nsymptoms may seem like signs of good health like a good appetite, high \\nenergy and slight weight loss,” Dr, O’Bell says. “Kidney disease in cats\\n is also common, and its presence may be masked by hyperthyroidism.”\\n \\n“Many cats can compensate for their chronic kidney disease by simply \\nincreasing their water intake to keep themselves hydrated,” Dr. O’Bell \\nadds. “This could go on for months or even years, and may only have \\novertly detected symptoms when the disease is already quite advanced.”\\n \\nHow to Help Your Cat Cope\\n \\nAs with most health conditions, early detection is key to achieving \\nbetter outcomes with your cat. Diagnosing kidney disease in cats early \\nand making the appropriate changes in their diet with specialized food \\ncan help manage their condition and lead to a longer survival rate. \\nUnderstanding your cat’s kidney disease will also help you to recognize \\nsigns of dehydration, a common complication, earlier on that if the disease was left undiagnosed.\\n \\nBy either hiding their symptoms completely or refusing medicine, cats\\n are particularly difficult patients to treat. “Fortunately,” says Dr. \\nO’Bell, “there are a variety of diagnostic aids and advanced treatments \\navailable to cats that can help their owners keep them healthy.”\\n \\nAsk your veterinarian about the different forms of medication \\navailable to you (liquid, tablet, gel, injection) and find the best fit \\nfor your cat. You’ll also want to ask about the different types of food \\navailable to help your cat manage their condition, and experiment with \\ndifferent brands until you find one that they like. Changes in helping \\nyour cat cope may be quick and easy or take a bit more time, but with \\npatience, you’ll be able to find something that works.\\n \\n“For some cats, simply the addition of a second litter box is enough \\nto please them,” Dr. O’Bell says. “For others, a short or long-term \\nprescription of mood-stabilizing drugs can be life saving.”\\n \\nPreventive care that includes annual visits to your veterinarian, \\nfeeding your cat a nutritionally balanced diet to maintain their weight,\\n maintaining an easily accessible and clean litter box and providing \\nyour cat multiple sources of fresh water are also essential in keeping \\nyour cat healthy and will help curb any major behavioral or medical \\nissues.\\n \\n \\nImage: Okssi / via Shutterstock\\n \\n \\nMore to Explore\\n \\nCat Scratching?

5JcZsNxT2BM,"Fame is Lame. This world; Its ALL biblical. We are the last generation. Evil is rampant because Satan knows his time is coming to a close he is trying hard to drag all to hell with him. He's doing a fine job. People are all in a deep sleep and care only about being entertained trying to be famous and shopping in strip mall's and listening to terrible satanically inspired music etc. Its a Godless world and all will be totally surprised when Jesus comes and they get left to deal with Satan in reality with all his demons which instead of being invisible will be completely visible to the naked eye. Only then will people believe this world is all one giant spiritual battle. Jesus died for us, loves us, and wants us to escape hell which is an actual place. \\n\\nToss aside this temporary world. If you do not know Jesus Christ or believe in God, I urge you to start. Whether you believe or not does not change the fact that The One and Only Jesus Christ is on his way....shortly. Like days. How many? Not sure. But my spirit feels it. This world is messed up. You must admit that. Its all a lie...all the things you think make you happy are lies. The devil hates you and is laughing at you. Jesus loves you. He died for you and the entire world. Even if you don't  love him. He is waiting for you to receive him in your heart. If you are ready to receive Jesus into your heart pray this prayer before it's too late. This is an urgent warning. Pray: Jesus I am a sinner, I believe you died on the cross for me and my sins and rose from the dead. Please forgive me of all my sins I am repenting now and I ask you to enter my heart right now. Change me. I want to make you happy. I want to be happy and go to heaven. I do not want to be stuck in the tribulation. Help me to open my spiritual eyes and ears before you get here. I ask this in Jesus name Amen! \\n\\nIf you just prayed this prayer welcome to the family! You made the most important decision of your life right now. Don't stop praying and remember a prayer can be a simple as Jesus, help me!  now get a bible or an app and read about revelation. And read Matthew and John chapters. For a start. I pray you made the right decision and prayed that prayer. See you in heaven!💛💛😘👏👍😊 \\n\\nTwitter: @YoNaturefreek",0,0

Furthermore Burger King has absolutely no right to conduct studies on people without their consent, what if someone lost their job/lost a loved one/whatever and came in for a burger and got served that shit because Burger King wanted to make an ad. Sure it would be nice to stand up for that kid, but it isn't mandatory. I'd also teach a kid to stand up for himself, tell these other kids to fuck off and leave me alone or at least not sit and eat with them. Yea bullying is wrong, but this ad is bullshit.",1,0
