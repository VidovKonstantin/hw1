They then went out in search from the start of iron man until the avengers creating a superbeing archive of names and people that were super powered to decide if they are good or bad and then create a fail safe using the good super beings.

As in, uncommon type of literature that took some by surprise.\\nAlso subversive ideas. Exploration of taboo and controversial themes.\\nUsually a fresh take on a theme.\\nPortrait of a given era that people might not be quite familiar with - microcosm exploration.\\nCloseness to the authors' own raw, potential scandalous stories, sometimes drawing controversies after publication, sometimes not so much.\\nSimple writting, easy to follow, easy to understand.\\nA somewhat realistic style, often coming with a bit of grittiness to it.\\nNot following a mainstream or conventional structure - monomyth, clear moral lessons, etc.\\n(optional) Realistic and raw coming of age story, reality crash, or a complete change of perspective and opinion. Critical reasoning put to test.\\nThe common people in extraordinary circunstances thing.\\nAll of those might be realized right after publication, up to years after the author has already died... matter of perception of the time it exploded in popularity.\\n\\nA whole bunch of literary classics follow some of these, when not all of these. Kerouac's On the Road, Sallinger's Catcher in the Rye, Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment, Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Palahniuk's Fight Club, Capote's In Cold Blood... to name a few.\\n\\nSee that I'm not criticising the works for following a certain structure nor trying to diminish the works because they have common characteristics... rather, I love them all and think they deserve the success.",0,0

YSVlSmZWzm0,"Awesome book. Not as good as A Tree Grows in Brooklyn imo, but let me explain why I compare them;\\nObviously Lee's first draft was Go Set a Watchman, but that didn't have the flare, potential, and raw development of pure child innocence. In TKAM, she really expressed how our eyes and minds evolve and though we remain in the same environment with the same people, we are seeing different things, or the same things with an inverted view. In ATGIB, Betty Smith does the same, but it's a longer book and I personally think more sophisticated. I think it's *meant* for an adult to walk in the shoes of the child they are reading about and the one they once were. It's longer, covers a longer time period, and in that sense, covers a greater range of development. Also, I liked Francie better than Scout. Francie was very self aware and paved her own path by being the oldest, opposed to Jem being Scout's senior. I greatly recommend everyone reads both *at least* once but I liked Betty Smith better.",0,0

YSVlSmZWzm0,"It‚Äôs famous because mindless, bureaucratic high-school teachers are told that the book is iconic, so they conform to their script by telling students to adore it. Therefore, your average sheep in society claims that they love To Kill a Mocking Bird, 1984, Le Mis, Mozart, Shakespeare, black-and-white cinema, traditional print and etc. Why do many individuals adamantly defend the quality of all these particular items, as they know little to nothing about these said topics? It is because, once something is old enough, no one can ever question its greatness. If you want to try to come across as intelligent, when you‚Äôre really not, become a sycophant; then, you can recite all the traditional works of art your teachers spoon-feed you; thus, allowing you to come across as a blind buffoon acting as intelligent. Why bother actually looking into traditional media, having actual exposure while developing an understanding, when one can simply say they respect it by reciting what their told in school? Also, dismiss any modern artists/material, pretending to have respect for the classical titles that you have never devoted the time or energy to see, hear or read -- opt out of seeing Dunkirk or Logan Lucky, chose to see the latest Happy Madison production, laugh at all the jokes while claiming the film was awesome, but claim to have deep respect for Alfred Hitchcock films they have never scene; furthermore, being some cad millennial who reads garbage like Twilight and listening to trash like Beiber.

YSVlSmZWzm0,"Awesome book. Not as good as A Tree Grows in Brooklyn imo, but let me explain why I compare them;\\nObviously Lee's first draft was Go Set a Watchman, but that didn't have the flare, potential, and raw development of pure child innocence. In TKAM, she really expressed how our eyes and minds evolve and though we remain in the same environment with the same people, we are seeing different things, or the same things with an inverted view. In ATGIB, Betty Smith does the same, but it's a longer book and I personally think more sophisticated. I think it's *meant* for an adult to walk in the shoes of the child they are reading about and the one they once were. It's longer, covers a longer time period, and in that sense, covers a greater range of development. Also, I liked Francie better than Scout. Francie was very self aware and paved her own path by being the oldest, opposed to Jem being Scout's senior. I greatly recommend everyone reads both *at least* once but I liked Betty Smith better.",0,0

YSVlSmZWzm0,"It‚Äôs famous because mindless, bureaucratic high-school teachers are told that the book is iconic, so they conform to their script by telling students to adore it. Therefore, your average sheep in society claims that they love To Kill a Mocking Bird, 1984, Le Mis, Mozart, Shakespeare, black-and-white cinema, traditional print and etc. Why do many individuals adamantly defend the quality of all these particular items, as they know little to nothing about these said topics? It is because, once something is old enough, no one can ever question its greatness. If you want to try to come across as intelligent, when you‚Äôre really not, become a sycophant; then, you can recite all the traditional works of art your teachers spoon-feed you; thus, allowing you to come across as a blind buffoon acting as intelligent. Why bother actually looking into traditional media, having actual exposure while developing an understanding, when one can simply say they respect it by reciting what their told in school? Also, dismiss any modern artists/material, pretending to have respect for the classical titles that you have never devoted the time or energy to see, hear or read -- opt out of seeing Dunkirk or Logan Lucky, chose to see the latest Happy Madison production, laugh at all the jokes while claiming the film was awesome, but claim to have deep respect for Alfred Hitchcock films they have never scene; furthermore, being some cad millennial who reads garbage like Twilight and listening to trash like Beiber.

He's a Canadian Chinese currently working in the kpop industry as a singer and a music producer. He's SUPER talented in playing musical instruments as he can plays about 5 types of musical instruments. He start learning the violin when he was 5 and piano at 6. He can now play the violin and the piano like a professional and he got into Berklee College of Music with a full scholarship. He can compose songs, sing, dance, rap speaks 6 to 7 languages (he's fluent in English) and he has a HUGE sense of humour. You can search him up in the internet to know more about him and watch those performances videos on YouTube. I really wish you could invite him to your show as it would be a huge honour for him.

dYstFRuPz8A,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens.

The only exception is maybe Season 3 Episode 1 because of those life altering events to the family dynamic.",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,These videos are clickbait and are a waste of time it's literally just a tv show not something that can be super analyzed,0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"anyway so I love how you used the sine wave as a parallel to Rick's fluctuating behaviour because it also fits since in s1e10, close rickcounters of the rick kind, Rick draws a sine wave to symbolize his brain waves. Morty counters that. Behaviour speaking, it might be the same.\\n\\nDue to Morty's over exposure with Rick, he's also starting to act a bit more like Rick in a sense that he's starting to get numb with all the crap he's pulled into. Could it be that whenever Rick cares, Morty, as Rick's counterpart, would show hints that he does not. Like in s2e9, Look Who's Purging Now (?), Rick's doing all the killing and encourages Morty to do the same but when Morty gets into a rampage and Rick tries to balance out Morty's repressed anger by telling him to dial it back a little and even to the point he had to electrocute Morty to unconsciousness to shut him up. \\n\\nTheir relationship, though incredible unhealthy, somewhat balances each other a lot which creates a very great dynamic we can't get enough of.",0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,You're conflating basic human emotion with the Rick of Ricks. It's a cartoon. Stop trying to analyze the character and enjoy the show by taking away from it what you will. This video scratches the surface of the complexities of Rick and it makes me cringe when people like the narrator tries to frame the show through logic. So  has Rick changed? NO he's the same god damn Rick he was in season 1 episode one. It just doesnt seem you can wrap your brain around that.,0,0

He's a Canadian Chinese currently working in the kpop industry as a singer and a music producer. He's SUPER talented in playing musical instruments as he can plays about 5 types of musical instruments. He start learning the violin when he was 5 and piano at 6. He can now play the violin and the piano like a professional and he got into Berklee College of Music with a full scholarship. He can compose songs, sing, dance, rap speaks 6 to 7 languages (he's fluent in English) and he has a HUGE sense of humour. You can search him up in the internet to know more about him and watch those performances videos on YouTube. I really wish you could invite him to your show as it would be a huge honour for him.

I am blessed with understanding through the Holy Spirit of our Father God Jahova God of Israel ! Who was ,is ,and will be to come ! For which it's written In the Holy Scriptures.( The Holy Bible ) A Nation that fights within the nation is a doomed nation ! If the tribes of Isreal ,as well as the 'gentiles''(all other nationalities), will be ripped out of the land ! Do you see the floods in all continents in different provinces ! Our Father God of Isreal curses as a punishment to the sinners who refuse to accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior !Out of Pure love , this message a warning to many of you, who walk in sin ! Turn your hearts and lives !, Confess with your mouths that Jesus is Lord and Savior! Pray to be forgiven ! Doing so you will become a full Christian , but you must then afterward stay loyal and keep the Law which was given to Moses! Its Written in Exodus ! Stay Loyal to the true living God Of Isreal till the end ! Glorify his Holy name with a honest and innocent heart joyfully ! It's written those who trust in the Lord, are truly happy ,In book of psalms! By keeping loyal in full reverence !, to our Lord Jesus Christ ,the son of man .Who is the light, the truth and the way to enter the Holy Kingdom of heaven. To inheriting eternal life ! The time is at hand !, decide now !,for love and peace and all happiness in a abundance of these blessings ,you need to obey Our Lord Jesus Christ and Our God Jahova of Isreal ! The second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, will come like a thief at night! It's written ! It will happen ! For no man know the hour or the day ! Fear of the Lord Jesus Christ , the Judge of Judges who knows all hearts!He has the keys to the kingdom of heaven .Those that will inherit eternal life, in the Kingdom of Heaven are faithful and loyal keeping all the law in the Holy Bible ! Those that will be saved are being blessed according to their righteousness ! And The ones who are being cursed are the sinners who don't change their hearts. Turning from their sinful ways ! Just because you clame your a Christian but you are not keeping the Ten Commandments ! , you are certainly not saved !  Believe and become a  Christian in a prayer of forgiveness ,to our Father God Jahova ! , Ending the prayer in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ Amen!  The sinners will be caught off guard when Jesus Christ returns at that  unexpected time. Our God will slowly curse the rebellious by famine ; disease as a punishment till you realize you are rebelling against our God ! But if God says enough in his Just Judgment on a sinner and takes away such a persons opportunity to inherit the promises .will be cursed to eternal hell; second death of condemnation.Our Father the creator is a just God !He not Just about peace and love ! For which it's written ! But also a God of Justice ! \\nIt's not of Gods will , that man shall parish in the destruction !ex. In Book of John Chapter 3 verse 16 ! For God So loved the earth , that he gave his only begotten son , for those that believe in him , shall not parish in the destruction but have eternal life. Be of God cheer this is actually good news ! It's god's mercy that he'd loved to show you ! And bless you abundantly ! But ignoring our Gods offer to live according to your own will , Its a warning to all man and women in all nations. These are the end days ! Revelation is here! Don't get caught in sin by ignoring this message of our Gods Instructions to surrender your lives and live by faith! Keep The Ten Commandments as it's the way to eternal salvation !

dYstFRuPz8A,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. üòÇ And yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

dYstFRuPz8A,Morty has changed a ton this season. He is becoming more like Rick.,3,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"I have definitely noticed a slight change in how Rick treats Morty than how he used to treat him in the previous seasons. He used to treat Morty with absolute distain but kept him around because he was a sort of cloaking device for Rick. But over the seasons, I've noticed that Rick is showing more care towards Morty and even the rest of the family, even though he tries his hardest to make them believe he's just using them for something when he saves them or he just didn't feel like having one of his grandkids die. I once heard a quote from a certain tv series that goes, When people see good, they expect good, and I don't want to have to live up to anybody's expectations. I feel like Rick actually does want to show more care towards his family, but his rude and demeaning nature would just butt in unannounced and hurt his family more, than if he just was cold and demeaning 24/7. That's just a theory, but let me ask this one question: why would Rick show any moments of concern to his family or anyone if he truly didn't care about anyone or anything? Why would he even care to act like a loving grandpa who loves his grandkids sometimes instead of just treating them unkindly and calling them names like normal? Wouldn't that be easier for him? There's also the theory that since he's lonely, he just wants company and is manipulating Summer and Morty to come with him on adventures. But he could just have Noob Noob , Mr.PoopyButthole, or any other creature come with him on his adventures...so that's something to think about.",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"HoooWeeeeee, clever analytic, but, with some of that (imo) you are wrong !... But i like to point out something interesting that makes the show greatly different (apart from its brilliant creativity) from other ani's like family guy, simpsons & american dad, that are stuffed with gross evil psy that without doubt can induce idiocy in real people as viewing fans emulate the psy & powerful personas, mainly due to the shows/ characters proven popularity's. So to explain this i ask: Who wants be like & do the things of the characters in Rick & Morty ? I''m sure very few will but also i'm sure that many real men can admit to allowing themselves consciously to be 'a bit Peter' on occasions, that also likely proved to be detrimental upon their real personas (speaking from experience). So with R&M all we want  to do is recite the funny catch phrases & continue to be entertained by its bizarre psy fantasy & great art. After watching R&M several times now iv'e come to the opinion that the show has some sort of 'inverted goodness' about it, on occasions in its story lines, such as the Unity story where the kids show disgust (rightly so) at the stinky post orgy, drunk grampa who obviously lost touch with all morality, who then eventually realizes his gross perversion, hanging his head in shame, alone with his self disgust (rightly so)...\\nAdditional note: whilst (imo) family guy, simpsons are mostly seriously failing to be funny, american dad,s recent seasons seem to excelling with creative stories & funnies (but of course still have somewhat evil content).",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"Every show after a few seasons has their characters change.\\n\\nWriters always take a few seasons to figure out what the characters are ultimately going to be by the end of their run. Watch any show and compare the characters with how they were in the first two seasons to how they were midway through the show's run to the end.\\n\\nThough this is different from older sitcommy shows since now shows are serialized and ongoing in writing, than stand-alone shows that don't build on a continuous narrative or a growth in characters. So it is more reasonable that he is intentionally changed to show growth.",0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"Rick may not care what other people think but he certainly cares about what his daughter thinks about him. Throughout all of his travels, Rick returns to some version of Beth. He strives for a life with at least some part of her. In the Cronenberg episode, Rick could have gone to any concieveable universe to run away but he chose to go to one where everything is pretty much the same.\\nIn the season 2 finale, Rick could have run away on his own or kept living on the run with his family but chooses to turn himself in so he can topple the Galactic Federation and return to the way things were.\\nAnd in the Pickle Rick episode, Rick has avoided Beth all day but after Jaguar advises Rick to spend time with his daughter while he can, Rick actually swallows his pride and attends and participates in a family therapy session.

These two things in my opinion, have completely des(buuuurrpp)troyed his compassion and value for life. Much the same way we value a fudgicle.  If you drop it.. there's another one in the fridge.

EbthMC6spAE,"Yeah, Norm tells too many shaggy dog stories to be truly funny. By the time he's done, I've lost interest and don't remember the setup enough to find the punchline funny. He does this because he's lazy. It's far easier to tell a half dozen or so shaggy dog stories and call it a comedy special than than to think up funny material worth our time. \\n\\nMost of his jokes are puerile in nature and are no better than a poor _Knock-knock joke._ He just takes it too far and stretches it into another of his shaggy dog stories that were much better left alone as Knock-knock jokes.",0,0

At the end of the episode it's implied that Rick knew he was in a simulation the whole time so, rick was aware that the morty he appeared to be having genuine fun with was a simulation. To me, this scene speaks to rick's character, he does want to have an emotional connection to morty but, he's too cold and detached to actually have one. I think he chose to experience the feeling of having a connection with morty within the simulation instead of the real morty.",0,0

He used to treat Morty with absolute distain but kept him around because he was a sort of cloaking device for Rick. But over the seasons, I've noticed that Rick is showing more care towards Morty and even the rest of the family, even though he tries his hardest to make them believe he's just using them for something when he saves them or he just didn't feel like having one of his grandkids die. I once heard a quote from a certain tv series that goes, When people see good, they expect good, and I don't want to have to live up to anybody's expectations. I feel like Rick actually does want to show more care towards his family, but his rude and demeaning nature would just butt in unannounced and hurt his family more, than if he just was cold and demeaning 24/7. That's just a theory, but let me ask this one question: why would Rick show any moments of concern to his family or anyone if he truly didn't care about anyone or anything? Why would he even care to act like a loving grandpa who loves his grandkids sometimes instead of just treating them unkindly and calling them names like normal? Wouldn't that be easier for him? There's also the theory that since he's lonely, he just wants company and is manipulating Summer and Morty to come with him on adventures. But he could just have Noob Noob , Mr.PoopyButthole, or any other creature come with him on his adventures...so that's something to think about.",0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,It was originally going to be called doc and Marty.,0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"That thing with Mortys brainwaves cancelling out Ricks doesn't have to mean his stupidity is what causes it. If it was then I think Rick would just come out and say something like it's because your an idiot Morty but he doesn't, instead he says Morty waves and since when has Rick ever cared about Mortys feelings as seen in the start of season 2 as time is literally falling apart he stops to call Summer and Morty pieces of shit. Also when Morty ask Rick and what makes them different he just dances around the question and moves on. I think there might be more to these Morty waves than Rick let on.",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"I Believe rick is changing, He fought for earth to not be destroyed. Rick says that there other mortys and summers and especially other versions of his daughter, So it wouldn't matter if rick got the earth destroyed or decided to leave, instead of fighting to save it, Because he could of just go get another family. remember, Morty and rick killed there other versions to replace that versions life. So i believe that Rick has a stronger bond with morty than people might think. Sure eh treats morty badly but there ALWAYS a second purpose, He teaching morty about the world and how in every other dimension or planets, life is the same every where.",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"HoooWeeeeee, clever analytic, but, with some of that (imo) you are wrong !... But i like to point out something interesting that makes the show greatly different (apart from its brilliant creativity) from other ani's like family guy, simpsons & american dad, that are stuffed with gross evil psy that without doubt can induce idiocy in real people as viewing fans emulate the psy & powerful personas, mainly due to the shows/ characters proven popularity's. So to explain this i ask: Who wants be like & do the things of the characters in Rick & Morty ? I''m sure very few will but also i'm sure that many real men can admit to allowing themselves consciously to be 'a bit Peter' on occasions, that also likely proved to be detrimental upon their real personas (speaking from experience). So with R&M all we want  to do is recite the funny catch phrases & continue to be entertained by its bizarre psy fantasy & great art. After watching R&M several times now iv'e come to the opinion that the show has some sort of 'inverted goodness' about it, on occasions in its story lines, such as the Unity story where the kids show disgust (rightly so) at the stinky post orgy, drunk grampa who obviously lost touch with all morality, who then eventually realizes his gross perversion, hanging his head in shame, alone with his self disgust (rightly so)...\\nAdditional note: whilst (imo) family guy, simpsons are mostly seriously failing to be funny, american dad,s recent seasons seem to excelling with creative stories & funnies (but of course still have somewhat evil content).",0,0

Because if the audience sees you trying to be the smartest person in the room, they're going to hate you.\\n\\nBut I believe, to anyone who investigates further and listens more closely, his brilliance becomes evident.",0,0

And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \\nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\\n\\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\\n\\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\\n\\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\\n\\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\\n\\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\\n\\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\\n\\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\\n\\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\\n\\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\\n\\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\\n\\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\\n\\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \\n\\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\\n\\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"yeah, it's called charecter development",0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"I really relate to Rick Sanchez from Rick and Morty. I‚Äôm nowhere near that intelligent - he‚Äôs an impossibly smart supergenius, so nobody is, and anyone who says otherwise is lying, especially if they‚Äôre saying they‚Äôre that intelligent. \\n\\nBut I do understand the depression that comes from being more intelligent than the majority of people in the world. You know things could be so much better if people could just see what you see and know what you know. And because you know things could be better, every sign that things are not getting better (or are getting worse) hurts your heart and makes getting through the day a Sisyphean slog. So you shut down your ability to care in order to survive, but it keeps popping back up no matter how hard you try to shove it down.\\n\\nI have a theory about Rick, that‚Äôs based on the fact I know something of the way he feels. My theory is that he DOES care, he just pretends he doesn‚Äôt, and often acts like he doesn‚Äôt, because the sheer psychological weight of how much he cares makes him suicidal and homicidal. There are little signs here and there in the series that he really does care, like how he keeps rescuing Morty, how he took down the intergalactic government (the act of someone who believes the world will be better off without it), some of the mind probe scenes from the first Evil Morty episode, and others. I‚Äôd have to scour the series again for more evidence.",0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,Actually he hasn't changed at all. It was established in season 1 that he cares about his grandkids.,0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"these people are not woke enough about rick and morty. Rick at the beginning of season 1 is rick from different dimension than that of the rick that we are currently seeing. the rick we are currently seeing is the rickest rick, he's a rogue rick, cares ab his grandchildren. but he's still fucking crazy and toxic as any of the many ricks. the rick from now, and the rick from the beginning, are literally not the same person because they are from two different dimension. it's just a different version of rick.. he hasn't actually changed. I think the creators are just showing us a lot more about rick as they continue to develop his character, but it is not about rick changing and become a caring guy c'mon, cliche much ??? It's about toxic relationships and nihilism and rick's truth be exposed. pay attention the the details read between the lines and you see this so easy. the writers are smart as fuck and they gotta be doing acid o some shit lol",0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,I fucking hate the rick and morty fanbase this video is shit itsjust explaining the obvious people eat this shit up,0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"So far season 3 has been a major disappointment except the Evil Morty episode, but other than that the whole thing has been a train wreck. It only made me hate Rick's family even more and more and rick himself too. How fucked up a family can be? S1 and S2 showed togetherness and family bonds, but not this season. It only showed that every family member is one giant arsehole to each other. Beth have daddy issues, Summer has typical teenage issues, Morty has become cold hearted and Rick is the most changed person out of all. I have lost the count as for how many times he has basically left his family members to die or rot for his own selfishness.",0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,No he didn‚Äôt,1,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"Technically, unity is just a disease. It is kinda genderless.",0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"In the Vindicators episode, sober Rick is the one to point out the possibility that drunk Rick was doing these things because he cares about Morty. I get all emotional when I'm drunk. So he's acknowledging and admitting, even if drunk Rick  doesn't think that way, it doesn't mean he doesn't care as a whole. In fact, I think it means MORE that he admits it while sober. Rest and Ricklaxation was a pretty huge development as well, in my opinion. Pretty blatant, don't you think? The most recent episode shows a lot of caring as well, holding Morty when he is distressed, and removing painful memories to comfort him when, if you think about it, he didn't have to. (Of course, in some cases he also did it to be selfish, but that's another discussion entirely. I may make a video about it, who knows?)\\nMy point is, I think season 3 is establishing that his uncaring wall is breaking down. The up and down wave is still going on, but that doesn't mean the wave isn't changing course. I hope Rick can find contentment in the end. I think we all do. It's probably going to be a really long development stretching over the whole series.",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,I feel like Rick is becoming good as much as Morty is becoming bad,0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,The bigest question isn't this it is evil morty orgins,0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"What if when Rick goes to confront the new president of The Citadel (Evil Morty), he can't kill  Evil Morty because it's a younger version of himself and is in fact his original Morty. However Evil Morty can kill Rick because it is an older version of  himself and thus it wouldn't affect him at that point. After Evil Morty Kills Rick he changes his way and eventually decides to take care of the Morty that we have seen in season three trying to be a better Rick. I know this theory is pretty off but i'm sure if you try and elaborate it could become a decent plausible theory. If this theory becomes bigger i am the first person to do it on September 20th 2017.",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"Rick's lack of emotions, or masking of it, is a defence mechanism. There are people in real life that do this and even I do it to a certain extent, just nowhere near as extreme... I hope. There's a term for it in psychology, but I forget the term. Apparently, if someone deduces everything to logic and tries to ignore any emotional aspect of a situation it becomes hard to counsel them and so a different strategy must be executed. I think this premise was kind of illustrated in the episode with the psychiatrist where Rick was the master of his universe, but also ironically slathered in rat blood and shit. He's a genius beyond comprehension yet he fails to realise his family is suffering and taking the brunt of his careless actions, which doesn't take a genius to realise.",0,0

At the end of the episode it's implied that Rick knew he was in a simulation the whole time so, rick was aware that the morty he appeared to be having genuine fun with was a simulation. To me, this scene speaks to rick's character, he does want to have an emotional connection to morty but, he's too cold and detached to actually have one. I think he chose to experience the feeling of having a connection with morty within the simulation instead of the real morty.",0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,Come on down to lil bits,0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"That thing with Mortys brainwaves cancelling out Ricks doesn't have to mean his stupidity is what causes it. If it was then I think Rick would just come out and say something like it's because your an idiot Morty but he doesn't, instead he says Morty waves and since when has Rick ever cared about Mortys feelings as seen in the start of season 2 as time is literally falling apart he stops to call Summer and Morty pieces of shit. Also when Morty ask Rick and what makes them different he just dances around the question and moves on. I think there might be more to these Morty waves than Rick let on.",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,"I Believe rick is changing, He fought for earth to not be destroyed.

So i believe that Rick has a stronger bond with morty than people might think. Sure eh treats morty badly but there ALWAYS a second purpose, He teaching morty about the world and how in every other dimension or planets, life is the same every where.",0,0

dYstFRuPz8A,Rick and morty have really switched roles this season. (even tho season 3 has been an origin story),0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,i think it's because Rick actually did lose his original family. Which he actually stayed with as they grew. He really does care but he can't let himself care because of the constant pain he feels seeing the faces of people he lived with but aren't them anymore in his eyes.,1,0

dYstFRuPz8A,He used to be more Doc from Back to the Future.,0,0
dYstFRuPz8A,"I have definitely noticed a slight change in how Rick treats Morty than how he used to treat him in the previous seasons. He used to treat Morty with absolute distain but kept him around because he was a sort of cloaking device for Rick. But over the seasons, I've noticed that Rick is showing more care towards Morty and even the rest of the family, even though he tries his hardest to make them believe he's just using them for something when he saves them or he just didn't feel like having one of his grandkids die. I once heard a quote from a certain tv series that goes, When people see good, they expect good, and I don't want to have to live up to anybody's expectations. I feel like Rick actually does want to show more care towards his family, but his rude and demeaning nature would just butt in unannounced and hurt his family more, than if he just was cold and demeaning 24/7. That's just a theory, but let me ask this one question: why would Rick show any moments of concern to his family or anyone if he truly didn't care about anyone or anything? Why would he even care to act like a loving grandpa who loves his grandkids sometimes instead of just treating them unkindly and calling them names like normal? Wouldn't that be easier for him? There's also the theory that since he's lonely, he just wants company and is manipulating Summer and Morty to come with him on adventures. But he could just have Noob Noob , Mr.PoopyButthole, or any other creature come with him on his adventures...so that's something to think about.",0,0

PKv4LdN_JYs,"(((Homosexuality is an abomination before a Holy God. If they dont repent and stop doing this sinful act they will not inherit the kingdom of God. Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \\nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\\n\\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\\n\\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\\n\\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\\n\\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\\n\\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\\n\\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\\n\\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\\n\\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\\n\\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\\n\\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\\n\\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\\n\\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \\n\\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\\n\\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",0,0

You know things could be so much better if people could just see what you see and know what you know. And because you know things could be better, every sign that things are not getting better (or are getting worse) hurts your heart and makes getting through the day a Sisyphean slog. So you shut down your ability to care in order to survive, but it keeps popping back up no matter how hard you try to shove it down.\\n\\nI have a theory about Rick, that‚Äôs based on the fact I know something of the way he feels. My theory is that he DOES care, he just pretends he doesn‚Äôt, and often acts like he doesn‚Äôt, because the sheer psychological weight of how much he cares makes him suicidal and homicidal. There are little signs here and there in the series that he really does care, like how he keeps rescuing Morty, how he took down the intergalactic government (the act of someone who believes the world will be better off without it), some of the mind probe scenes from the first Evil Morty episode, and others.

I think the creators are just showing us a lot more about rick as they continue to develop his character, but it is not about rick changing and become a caring guy c'mon, cliche much ???

It only showed that every family member is one giant arsehole to each other.

So he's acknowledging and admitting, even if drunk Rick  doesn't think that way, it doesn't mean he doesn't care as a whole. In fact, I think it means MORE that he admits it while sober. Rest and Ricklaxation was a pretty huge development as well, in my opinion. Pretty blatant, don't you think? The most recent episode shows a lot of caring as well, holding Morty when he is distressed, and removing painful memories to comfort him when, if you think about it, he didn't have to. (Of course, in some cases he also did it to be selfish, but that's another discussion entirely. I may make a video about it, who knows?)\\nMy point is, I think season 3 is establishing that his uncaring wall is breaking down. The up and down wave is still going on, but that doesn't mean the wave isn't changing course. I hope Rick can find contentment in the end. I think we all do. It's probably going to be a really long development stretching over the whole series.",0,0

PKv4LdN_JYs,"(((Homosexuality is an abomination before a Holy God. If they dont repent and stop doing this sinful act they will not inherit the kingdom of God. Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \\nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\\n\\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\\n\\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\\n\\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\\n\\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\\n\\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\\n\\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\\n\\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\\n\\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\\n\\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\\n\\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\\n\\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\\n\\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \\n\\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\\n\\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",0,0

I wanted Discovery to resemble more of a Star Trek, but still be unique like TOS, TNG, DS9, and VGR against a space sequence. It just feels too soon to have a new show try something different after the previous Enterprise sequence was such a failure. Needs to go back to its origins. Seeing the visual sequence of Discovery still taking me off a bad aftertaste that I still have with Enterprise.",2,0

This Trek has been more heavy handed and starting its arc in a war so it theme needed to match it.

Lwn97mpBCu8,"Ok, you may want to check your recipe. There's only 2 ingredients in your recipe that are actually in Sp√§tzle dough: the egg and the salt. \\nTraditionally you use a specific flour which is a little bit more coarse than AP. For lack thereof, you could use AP. However, there is no milk or milk product in Sp√§tzle - never was, never will be. Sp√§tzle are made from flour, eggs, water and salt. That's it. Sure you can add cayenne if you like, but it's normally not in there.\\nThe grater is a good idea in lieu of a specific tool, although a good old metal colander with the large holes will be a lot better. I have to agree with the other comments: technically these are not Sp√§tzle but Kn√∂pfle - the shape is the problem. Traditional Sp√§tzle are shaved off a wooden board which results in a short strand shape, not a drop shape. That said, most (southern) German restaurants will offer the drop shape as Sp√§tzle (mostly for ease of creating them in larger batches), so you can get away with it too.",0,0

Lwn97mpBCu8,"Im sorry, this is not authentic at all Chef John. I usually love your videos.\\n1 egg is way to little. I can give you 5 different recipes - all have 5 or more eggs in it. That's whats makes the Sp√§tzle so good, it adds colour and taste. I make them on a regular base. I can live with the milk, the creme fraiche, why??? Thats a no no! Milk, heard of it. Normally youd use water and oil.\\nThe cayenne is okay, but you should really add nutmeg, thats important. You can vary your Sp√§tzle by adding herbs to. I even tried a dark Sp√§tzle batter with unsweetened coco powder. Or spinach. But you need to let the batter rest too. \\nThe rest is totally acceptable how to prepare them.",0,0

Lwn97mpBCu8,"Ok, you may want to check your recipe. There's only 2 ingredients in your recipe that are actually in Sp√§tzle dough: the egg and the salt. \\nTraditionally you use a specific flour which is a little bit more coarse than AP. For lack thereof, you could use AP. However, there is no milk or milk product in Sp√§tzle - never was, never will be. Sp√§tzle are made from flour, eggs, water and salt. That's it. Sure you can add cayenne if you like, but it's normally not in there.\\nThe grater is a good idea in lieu of a specific tool, although a good old metal colander with the large holes will be a lot better. I have to agree with the other comments: technically these are not Sp√§tzle but Kn√∂pfle - the shape is the problem. Traditional Sp√§tzle are shaved off a wooden board which results in a short strand shape, not a drop shape. That said, most (southern) German restaurants will offer the drop shape as Sp√§tzle (mostly for ease of creating them in larger batches), so you can get away with it too.",0,0

Its fluent and she barely stumbles on words. When it comes to me, for example, i am hispanic, but english was my first language. i stumble on spanish even tho I'm fluent. So its interesting bc we see a shift in roles through language from an individual who grew with spanish as her first language and fluent english as a secondary. We can see how she speaks and where she looks for words to say to get across he sentences. Just like i would, speaking spanish. Its quite intriguing",0,0

To say this has nothing to do with race is to be absurdly ignorant on the matter.

04UjShXZbD0,"This is Crybaby's Story \\n\\n(Crybaby üë∂üò¢) Cry Baby was brought into her messed up world with an older brother, mother, and father\\n\\n(Dollhouseüëßüè†). Cry Baby's life at home; her father was having an affair, causing her mother to fall into depression and drink away her emotions. Her brother also was addicted to drugs, as he smoked cannabis. She felt plastic and as fake as a doll in a plastic dollhouse, she knew one day someone would find out her 'perfect family' isn't perfect after all\\n\\n(Sippycupüç∑) As Cry Baby's mom catches her husband bringing yet another girl to their home, she cruelly murdered him and his mistress after having a few too many drinks - with the influence of jealousy that overtook her and tried to drug her own daughter, after Cry Baby sees what tragedy took place that night and Crybaby's Angel Look is her Innocence being Lost/Destroyed\\n\\n(Carouselüé†) Soon, she meets a boy at the carnival with whom she falls in love and enters a one-sided relationship, which makes her feel like she's stuck on a carousel\\n\\n(Alphabet Boyüë±) It took her awhile to realize how Toxic the relationship was , but then Crybaby broke up with him, when she realizes he doesn't deserve her love. She showed him that she's big enough to say 'fuck you' and move on from him\\n\\n(SoapüõÄ) Cry Baby met another boy named Johnny whom she felt a connection to, but was scared to say that she loved him, so she washed her mouth out with soap when Johnny came over to play with her\\n\\n(Training Wheelsüö≤) After a while of contemplating, she finally decided that it was time to take it to the next level. She took Johnny's training wheels off to show him that he is free, and to show how much she loves him (Johnny May have been imaginary I'm not sure)\\n\\n(Pity Partyüéàüò≠üéà) She invited all of her friends and her newfound lover to her birthday party, but to her disappointment, nobody showed up. This drew the line for Cry Baby and it was the beginning of her slowly changing. She went on a rampage and wrecked her house\\n\\n(Tag You're itüê∫üöê) Now that she was single once again, she had become vulnerable to the wolves that were on the prowl. She was snatched up by the Big Bad Wolf, who had disguised himself as an ice cream man, after he tricked her into eating drugged ice cream. He then took her back to his awful home\\n\\n(Milk and Cookiesüçºüç™) The wolf orders Cry Baby to make him milk and cookies. Now evidently insane, Cry Baby poisoned the milk and cookies she made for her kidnapper and escaped.\\n\\n(Pacify herüôä‚û°Ô∏èüë©) After escaping, Cry Baby discovered a boy in a relationship where he was not happy. Cry Baby is desperate to free the boy from the relationship after they Fall in Love, then pacifying Basic Bitch, but in the end she is unsuccessful after the Basic Bitch wins him over with her breast.\\n\\n(Mrs Potato Headüë©üíÑ) Now aware that attractive bodies have a great effect on boys, Cry Baby begins to grow self-conscious. She believes her hair needs to be a different color, she has to be thinner, and she has to have bigger breasts in order to be loved. However, after seeing Mrs. Potato Head on the TV screen and the consequences of changing yourself for boys, Cry Baby realizes that she is perfect the way she is and there is nothing she or anyone else needs to change\\n\\n(Mad Hatterüê∞üé©) Ultimately, she learns what it means to love oneself, to have self-respect, and to have self-worth. She also learns that everybody goes a bit mad sometimes, and that's perfectly okay and Now She's a Crazy, Perfect Crybaby(She was always Perfect anyways) \\n\\n(Play Dateüç≠üë´) CryBaby meets a new boy and their dating but he doesn't really love her,hence the quote when I try to talk you're always playing board games so she will try to do anything for him,even if it means only sex\\n\\n(Teddy Bearüêª) CryBaby is in an abusive relationship and she doesn't know what happened or how it could've happened, so she escapes from from her Teddy Bear \\n\\n(CakeüéÇ) Cake might be the continuation of Play Date but I'm not sure.The reason I think this is because Play Date is about her doing absolutely anything to get love,even if it means only sex and Cake is where she says I'm not a piece of cake for you to just discard,while you walk away which means Crybaby is trying to say, you can't just use me for Sex.\\n\\n(Gingerbread manüç™üë±) Crybaby wants the find the perfect man for her, so, she thinks she needs a Gingerbread man one who's always crazy and never calls her baby! she wants the perfect man and wants Sex. That's the one she wants but she never found a boy that's like a GingerbreadMan.",1,0

Normally youd use water and oil.\\nThe cayenne is okay, but you should really add nutmeg, thats important. You can vary your Sp√§tzle by adding herbs to. I even tried a dark Sp√§tzle batter with unsweetened coco powder. Or spinach. But you need to let the batter rest too. \\nThe rest is totally acceptable how to prepare them.",0,0

Lwn97mpBCu8,"Ok, you may want to check your recipe. There's only 2 ingredients in your recipe that are actually in Sp√§tzle dough: the egg and the salt. \\nTraditionally you use a specific flour which is a little bit more coarse than AP. For lack thereof, you could use AP. However, there is no milk or milk product in Sp√§tzle - never was, never will be. Sp√§tzle are made from flour, eggs, water and salt. That's it. Sure you can add cayenne if you like, but it's normally not in there.\\nThe grater is a good idea in lieu of a specific tool, although a good old metal colander with the large holes will be a lot better. I have to agree with the other comments: technically these are not Sp√§tzle but Kn√∂pfle - the shape is the problem. Traditional Sp√§tzle are shaved off a wooden board which results in a short strand shape, not a drop shape. That said, most (southern) German restaurants will offer the drop shape as Sp√§tzle (mostly for ease of creating them in larger batches), so you can get away with it too.",0,0

They employ psychologists to help design the game to be addictive. They target the Reward Zone of your brain. This is why u get upset when u lose and your first thought is.. Wish I had some gems. Everyone should boycott the builder base.  Those guys at the top with gemmed bases are givwn gems by supercell. Notice how they cater to the youtubers because they have 10,000 gem spending spree videos.. They are paid in gems to get you to buy gems.. This game was fun. Now its just a money pit..

ZcTvrxwP6Is,I actually really like the whole artistic sketch drawing thing.  Pretty cool,0,0
ZcTvrxwP6Is,Star Trek purists really are the worst. They can't accept change in any way. It must be a sad life. I loved Next Generation and I got hate when I said I liked Enterprise. I felt like Enterprise captured the sense of exploration and discovery just as well as its source material. I am yet to watch Discovery but I'm guessing it will be a good show even though everyone says it's  bad. I can guarantee that all the people hating will most likely not ever watch It but will just blindly follow what some Internet blog says.,0,0
ZcTvrxwP6Is,I cant be the only person who thought this resembled the game of thrones opening sequence.,0,0

ZcTvrxwP6Is,"Robert Wise, after listening to the Jerry Goldsmith's first iteration of The Enterprise had two words for Maestro Goldsmith:  No Theme.  Mr. Goldsmith then went back and wrote what is perhaps one of _the_ best pieces of cinematic score ever written.\\n\\nHistory repeats itself with this intro music.  It's nice; but it has no theme.  Perhaps a rewrite will have a repeat result.",0,0

ZcTvrxwP6Is,"Been watching Star Trek since I was a kid, gone too a few Star Trek conventions as well. I am honestly excited.

ZcTvrxwP6Is,Kinda of shocked by how negative of a reaction this is getting... I'm a huge Star Trek fan and absolutely love this theme and title sequence. Perfect blend of old and new.,1,0
ZcTvrxwP6Is,"LOL This is one reason why I say I am a Sci fi fan and not a star trek fan these days, The fan base (just like star wars) are a bunch of crying babies. This Intro is not fantastic but it is good. The first episodes (despite the Visual changes to Klingons) were fantastic save a few hiccups ( I am looking at you turbo lift with discovery deck layout in it.). So please stop bitching, enjoy the show and if it makes you so mad you cant shut up and go enjoy the over 1000 episodes of start trek and first 10 movies.",1,0

ZcTvrxwP6Is,"This is suppose to be the main theme?  You got to be kidding me.  I don't feel like getting out of my chair let alone going exploring solar systems.  This theme is so lackluster, uninspiring the composer should be ashamed of himself.  You had a whole group of talented musicians waiting to bang it out and you give them this crap.  There is no theme to this whatsoever!  But I guess kudos to you because you used a few bars from the past theme at the beginning.

Most would just disable ratings and comments due to hate speech and other things of the like.\\n\\n\\nRegardless of political affiliation, do you think this kinds of thing would have been acceptable during the Obama presidency? (On this large a scale of course. Like, every week on the same show type of scale.) I dunno. I have a feeling they'd be either told to stop or widely condemned by mainstream media, regardless of content. It's interesting to see how things truly don't work both ways.\\n\\n\\nAlso the comments...yeebus...\\nNot only is it people just posting things like fuk trump bruh for likes and not to start an actual discussion. (Obviously this isn't a political forum and it isn't trying to be, nor do I even expect it here.) But, I find it interesting that not even a year into his presidency people say things like He's the worst president of all time. When they can name about 5 presidents total (Obama, GW Bush, Reagan, Nixon and JFK) and they only know what they've been told from biased sources. Off the top of my head, U.S. Grant was shit, Taft was shit, Eisenhower really wasn't great, W Wilson really was kinda shit....\\n\\nAh, who am I kidding. Nobody will actually read all of this comment, they'll just read the first paragraph and leave a reply like Stfu Nazi or such gems as You're some kind of Russian spam bot, comrade as if I'm even coming to the man's defence. Plot twist, I'm actually not. I'm just saying you should at least give the poor fucker a chance regardless of what you hear from your university teachers and friends/social media about the current administration. Do research. Formulate your own opinion. Don't just blindly follow media outlets, regardless of their affiliation. \\n\\nYou're actually comparing someone who hasn't had a chance to really do anything yet to someone who failed to intervene in a timely fashion on WW1 and cost the world millions of lives that didn't need to be lost, or that tried to suppress women's rights protestors for the sake of their own beliefs and a backwards nation's belief. I mean, until he really, really, really fucks up, why are people acting like he's already been the worst president ever? Well, probably because it's what they saw on MSNBC, CNN, Fox News, read on twitter or saw on SNL.\\n\\n\\n\\nFor those who got the the end, good on you. You actually read what I have to say and realize I'm advocating for political awareness, and am trying to deconstruct the mob mentality and way that these new age liberals handle politics.\\n\\nI'd pour you a drink, but sadly the Internet has only come so far at this point.",0,0

He's not going to hurt America too bad, no matter what happens, in the end we will still be America and Americans have our freedoms and trump respects most if not all of our freedoms, and as president he can't really take our freedoms away anyways it has to go through the mostly democratic government. if he does wanna take a freedom of ours it'd be pretty hard for him. So I just can't see how he could hurt us bad enough to the point where we are so scared that so many people were crying that he won, more people than ever were threatening to move, even kindergarteners have started thinking they know everything about politics and they are scared too, most of the people who are scared, couldn't tell you much of a reason other than trumps bad or trump will hurt us \\nAnd if you read to the bottom of this please don't start an argument below this, I don't wanna start any argument",0,0

ETR9qrVS17g,60 years ago evil white racists put black people in Ghettos. They just drew a line across the city; One side was for pure white Aryans only while the other was for filthy nonwhites.

ETR9qrVS17g,"Let me put it this way. Let's say you have a white male in his mid 20's that wears flannels and has a combover haircut, and a black male of the same age wearing a black tee, some fresh jeans, a lined up beard and a fade going on. Both living in a more ghetto area. A gang (of African American origin) rolls by in their gangster car whatever that may be. They're looking to recruit. They see the white man, and the black man standing side by side. Who is more likely for the black gang to want to join them? The black man. So the black man says yes and runs off toting guns (doing normal gang stuff) and he gets into a skrimish with the police because of this activity. He's going to panic while doing whatever he's doing and may run from or pull a gun on the police. He takes his gun out and pow goes the officers weapon. Killing the black man for putting the officers life in danger, justifiably no? So then it gets to the media. Hate crime white officer kills innocent black man so we pin the blame on Mr. WhiteOfficer and those in the neighborhood he was from riot against the police, because clearly the black man was innocent, how couldn't he be? He's black, black people are innocent of everything! (Sarcasm obviously) but let's go back to the why's and how's. Why did the black man join the black gang? Because he was black and felt he fit in. He could have said no but he didn't. He could have followed the same path as the mid 20's white man. Got a job, saved money, and moved out of this neighborhood. But instead he dies and it's white people's fault, and nobody else. It's not any governments fault for the black man joining this drug running gun slinging gang. It's his own. I'm not sure if you or anybody else notices but, black people, white people, Spanish people, Muslim people, Chinese, the list goes on. We ALL have a brain. We ALL have goals. Why is it every other race can manage to pull themselves out of shitty ghetto neighborhoods, but black people can't? Tell me, when's the last time you saw a Korean in the hood? Maybe China Town in NY, but I doubt outside of that. I'm convinced, black people are used to that life, they don't want to better themselves, they don't want to better their communities. Call me racist or whatever you'd like, but think about that. It's not about the color of your skin, it's about the strength of your body and soul.",0,0
ETR9qrVS17g,So the fact that in a America the vast majority of the population is white and only around 20 percent are of different ethnicities means that there should be only white suburbs just simply because of the numerical difference. is it wrong that people want to live with their Own kind when we see so many cities and towns go to shit after large numbers of blacks moved there and instead of getting jobs the went into crime and how dare you say unbearably white there would be upheaval if you said the same about blacks,0,0

aNlUKzO1ThY,"Weapons aren't the problem. There is very manipulative, smart, evil people out there who will go through any means necessary to kill a large amount of people for no real reason at all.. Most people who do mass shootings like this are patient and they plan ahead, if we were to SOMEHOW stop EVERYONE from getting hands on a automatic rifle then these crazy people will just learn how to make Bombs to kill people instead. Getting things to make a rifle automatic is easier than learning how to make a decent sized bomb I presume, that's why we see more mass shootings than bombings in America because it's easier to use and buy a gun than it is to make a large bomb. Taking away guns nor making back round or mental checks is going to stop things like this from happening again, people with patients can do anything (good or bad). Its impossible to stop people from getting guns and it's impossible to know how people are going to use them.\\n\\nIf people out there really want things like this to stop happening ( which it won't, crazy people are everywhere) people need to realize that stoping individuals from buying any type of gun is going to do Absolutely Nothing.",0,0

Then there's the report of a woman that got carried away harrassing people saying you're all going to die. Why aren't we hearing more of that? Have they found this (apparently hispanic) couple thatt said that yet?  I think this is a massive false flag or cover up. Someone from a (((protected group))) targeted White Americans in the most savage way and they don't want to deal with the backlash of people realizing where it came from ad what goes behind all that. Some Antifa J$w or Black guy. They then framed some old White guy they had scoped out. This is speculation. Of course. But it seems more plausible than what is being told.

Getting things to make a rifle automatic is easier than learning how to make a decent sized bomb I presume, that's why we see more mass shootings than bombings in America because it's easier to use and buy a gun than it is to make a large bomb. Taking away guns nor making back round or mental checks is going to stop things like this from happening again, people with patients can do anything (good or bad). Its impossible to stop people from getting guns and it's impossible to know how people are going to use them.\\n\\nIf people out there really want things like this to stop happening ( which it won't, crazy people are everywhere) people need to realize that stoping individuals from buying any type of gun is going to do Absolutely Nothing.",0,0

In the video reports the rat tat tat sounded very local and very odd,not like they are coming from a distance.   More like a Gatling gun or multiple sprays.   I doubted this narrative from the start. It sounded very real at first and then the facts started tripping over each other faster and faster. A lone wolf gunman - then the gun numbers started shooting up from 1-23 at last count. What does that tell us?  His female accomplice story kept changing. I wasn't sure at first if it was just crisis actors or if it involved real murder with an Oswald twist.

ORSMs7lZtdY,"LICE-METH-HEAD WHITES are so ignorant and are only proud because they're psychologically brainwashed: You think White Supremacy is going to talk down itself. 1) Where is their evidence to support Jesus Christ and Biblical characters were White, or that Whites possess superior intelligence than others in the world. Whites exploit others talent, ideas, inventions, money, music, work, property, etcetera and claim ownership. That is why I never fill out surveys or do more than necessary when Whites are involved in my meetings, directly or indirectly. 2) Look up Neanderthal DNA or Monkey Rhesus DNA in Whites. Why are Whites prone to more internal disorders and skin diseases because of much lower melanin levels? 3) Google White mutant genes, which are inferior biologically which produce a physically inferior product that burns in the Sun, even with their chemical sunscreen--VAMPIRES. White scientists reveal Whites age more and have more cases of arthritis, Autism, eye seeing disorders(the need for regular and UV glasses)and hearing disorders(the need for hearing aids) compared to Blacks. Why are Whites having more plastic surgery, organ transplants, Testosterone or hormonal injections to mitigate these abnormalities. 4)CRIMES, CRIMES, AND CRIMES: Whites make a declining 14% of world pop., but commit more crime than any race and its effect Millions of people compared to Blacks. Whites commit more robbery and theft: white collar crimes, fraud, ethic violations, political corruption, and extortion.  Whites commit more Murder with evidence of the Indians, Holocaust, lynchings, frivolous wars, documented police killings, documented doctors' killings of patients, even White on White crime, etcetera. 5) White Supremacists hate diversity because it isThe end of the White Race. If Whites were truly superior, they could thrive in any and under all conditions, and among all people because all non-whites are Inferior--right? 6) If White is beautiful and right, why a billion dollar tanning industry and melanin injections? LOL! 7) Whites do more drugs: Opium and Heroin, Cocaine, Prescriptions, Meth, Hallucinogens, Amphetamines, Morphine, and Alcohol. 8) Whites are Secretly on more welfare, disability, unemployment, and file more bankruptcies compared to others. 9) There are other sources of entertainment besides Incest, Beastality, and deceptive superiority, so use them! 10) Last, Blacks are diverted from certain areas of expertise or professions and for good reason. The shadow government does not want black people to go into areas of Archaeology, Egyptology, Biochemistry, Law, Medicine, etc. in large numbers because expertise in these fields will show black people just how fraudulent the world‚Äôs current paradigm really is. \\n\\nGuys my fingers are tired and feelings may get hurt, but the list goes on with numerous evidence. Elephants don't swap flies, but I'll remind Whites to go back to the cave in Europe to continue dying out, regardless of the Sun!\\n\\nNonetheless, White Supremacists typically will deny everything, deflect, use opinions and circular logic while shifting the blame to Blacks or non-whites.

The actual facts of the case implicate the FBI selling weapons to ISIS terrorists much like Fast/Furious, and directly enabling ISIS to commit mass murder in Las Vegas.This investigation needs to be opened to the public, the FBI involved in this all need to be prosecuted for treason, and Trump needs to crack down on this kind of bullshit.\\n\\nSurveillance footage would immediately confirm this theory, we should demand that all relevant surveillance be released to the public.

However it works on the same principles as if I told you the benefits of burning trash, but neglected the negatives.\\n\\nin 1968 racism was officially illegal, it is therefore prosecutable to do racist things (such as not allow loans to black or white people). However since 1968 we have passed laws into a different direction. Under the pretext of fighting racism - we have created racism. Today an asian must score much higher on their tests to get to the same university as a black person, black people get much more gov‚Äôt subsidies/help under the idea of everyone is the same, so we MUST pay for the one lacking...\\n\\nThe point is this. Today america is becoming racist to its founding race - whites. You can look it up, there are cases when some people dyed their skin black to get into college. I hope that with the rise of BLM and antifa (and their inevitable massacre under the pretext of ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù) that these policies will be lifted. \\n\\nRemember - does the descendent of yugoslavia (Serbia) pay the nations that seceded? They commited many atrocities, yet they dont pay anything... does Austria? Austria controlled Slovenia for 1000 years, is slovenia supposed to get money from austria? Where does this end? Will the US get money from the UK? Or will the UK get money from the US?\\n\\nRemember that the triangle trade only happened because blacks themselves sold their kind for european technology - it was their choice, knowing full well what would happen. Should blacks pay whites because they got them to america?\\n\\nAs you can see this is where this eventually leads. This video should be taken as propaganda. Using past justifications for the policies of today is extremely close to what the nazis believed in.",0,0

The guy said he didn't know that this was still happening, and he worked hard to get his house, but their response to him was cold and what.... apparently he has to feel white guilt?? For what? So he doesn't deserve to have a nice house he got because 80+ years ago it wasn't fair?? Give me a break! \\n\\nA black person can make a great living and afford a house in a nice suburb, and there's nothing stopping them. We just moved into suburbs and we have a black family move in down the street. Brand new construction. These houses are NOT cheap. I'm not bragging, just pointing that out. So it's not impossible. But like the guy in the vid said, he worked HARD to get that house. HARD WORK. It's gotta happen. That's the key. His skin color didn't give him that house. His work ethic and money smarts did. I imagine the new family in our neighborhood's father has a really nice job to afford their house. Handouts won't get you a place in these types of neighborhoods. They just won't. No matter your race. Or they unwisely purchased it with outrageous amounts of debt and will most likely lead to being house broke or foreclosure.\\n\\nIf there is unfair or illegal discrimination, it SHOULD be stopped.

ETR9qrVS17g,"Nothing wrong with white people living together. What is wrong is that banks, like everything else in America during the early and mid 1900s were racist toward people of color (mainly the blacks). Thus, the blacks didn't have the same opportunities to get into good neighborhoods or schools. That just the truth of the situation. They weren't given a fair chance to own property or make business adventure. And the impact of that racism is still felt today. It's only been 1 or 2 generations since then. A lot of the people who experienced this are still alive. And they were definitely disadvantaged by that racism, which led to them not doing as well in life, and then they raise their kids in that situation, who go on to raise their kids in that situation as well. Yes, it is possible to work hard and break the wheel, but that is not the case for most people in the world. Most people end up being in the same working class and in the same environment as their parents. Raised in the hood you probably stay in the hood. Raised in the trailer park, you probably stay in trailer park. Raised in the suburbs, you'd probably stay in the suburbs. The wealth that  parents and grandparents had/have does impact the children today.And it is a fact that white parent's and grandparents were afforded more opportunities than minorities.  Very few people rise above, become wealthy, do well and aren't a product of their environment. Those people are few and rare. They are exceptions, and you all expect every person of color to be an exception. Why is it so hard to even consider that other people weren't afforded the same opportunities as you? Does it make you feel like you accomplished less? It's not 100% of the time, which might be why you are so quick to retaliate against the truth that people of color weren't given a fair chance, but sometimes (sometimes-SOMETIMES- idk u caught it yet, but ->sometimes<-) in America, life is easier if you're white.",0,0

po5VUW3I8P8,"Thank you for another great video, you really make things simple to understand. This is such a simple and cool feature, I will look into this further as it will only take us a few days to add this to MASSO controller, internally through software we can change the signal to the VFD to vary the RPM's. Just one question, I guess this speed variation would depend on the job size and will the user need to set this every time depending on the job or it can be left to a fixed rate?, thank you again",138,28

One of the greybeards in the shop came over and showed me how to run it right, wait for 3 full revolutions of the knurl tool then drop the spindle into neutral for the last 3 this worked every single time  and I was getting probably 50% more parts out. That day I learned the further out you get on the part the lower your speed and feed should be if you want chatter free parts.

Wouldn't it work much better to just lower the RPM as soon as chatter occours? Shouldn't this prevent the workpiece from vibrating much better?

It also had a knob you could turn to adjust RPMs, which the operators would adjust up and down continuously on passes that unexpectedly had chatter.  Increasing depth of cut often helped, as well, so we might program our cuts to increase in depth one pass then go straight across on the second (also helps with insert wear).  Some of our boring bars had semi-hollow centers so another engineer once dropped a stack of coins inside (... BIG boring bars) on a particularly bad project which actually helped so if your tools have a cavity perhaps putting some sand or BBs inside would help.",0,0

po5VUW3I8P8,"AvE, Not sure about your 1-3phase controller but most of the ones I have worked with allow for a set acceleration and deceleration time, usually a parameter in the extended settings. This allows larger and heavier motors more time to accelerate if required. \\n\\nYou could increase the up/down time a little and then slow your 555 timer down a little, this would give your motor a slightly easier time of it as well as meaning you can probably increase the chooch factor by having a wider range of frequencies to play with. higher motor speed what for the larger workpieces and lower for the smaller.",0,0

So I digress in the right direction of said question.. is there a way to resurface  them thar  non stick pans? cause they do tend to fill the land fills once scratched.

z5Wo-iF6lA8,"Want to know for sure that you are going to Heaven when you die? (and everyone dies)  \\n\\nJesus is the Son of the Living GOD.  The only true GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth and there can only be ONE God that actually created everything, not many... \\n\\nJesus Died, was Buried and Rose from the dead on the third day, proving He is GOD.\\n\\nJesus said in John 14:6; Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúI am The Way, The Truth, and The Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.‚Äù  NKJV\\n\\nActs 4:12 states; Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name [Jesus] under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.  NKJV\\n\\nJesus said in John 3:16-17; For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world (YOU) that He even gave His One and only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him as Savior shall not perish, but have eternal life.  For God did not send the Son into the world to judge and condemn the world, that is, to initiate the final judgment of the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.  AMP\\n\\nJesus said in John 3:3; I assure you and most solemnly say to you, unless a person is Born Again, reborn from above, spiritually transformed, renewed, sanctified, he cannot ever see and experience the kingdom of God.  AMP\\n\\nRomans 10:9-11 states; that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, ‚ÄúWhoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.  NKJV\\n\\nRomans 10:13 states; For ‚Äúwhoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.‚Äù  NKJV\\n\\n1 Corinthians 15:1-5 states; Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you‚Äîunless you believed in vain.  3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ Died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was Buried, and that He Rose Again the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.  NKJV\\n\\nAnd REPENT...\\n\\nActs 17:30 Therefore God overlooked and disregarded the former ages of ignorance; but now He commands all people everywhere to REPENT [that is, to change their old way of thinking, to regret their past sins, and to seek God‚Äôs purpose for their lives].  AMP\\n\\nJesus said in Mark 1:15 ‚ÄúThe [appointed period of] time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; REPENT [change your inner self‚Äîyour old way of thinking, regret past sins, live your life in a way that proves REPENTANCE; seek God‚Äôs purpose for your life] and believe [with a deep, abiding trust] in the good news [regarding salvation].‚Äù  AMP\\n\\n1 John 3:10 In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.  NKJV\\n\\nFrom what I have read we know how 8 of Jesus' disciples died and all 8 of those 8 chose death rather than to simply state that Jesus had not actually rose from the dead, that they were just lying, we made it all up.  Think about that!  Would you ever choose to be murdered to maintain a complete LIE?  No you would not.  You would say ‚Äúok, ok, it was a lie‚Äù.  They would not deny their Lord to keep this life because they knew they have eternal life in Jesus because they saw Him raised from the dead.\\n\\nPlease get in a quiet and alone place SOON and pray to Jesus that He show you somehow if these things above are true.  If you are sincere, He will answer you‚Ä¶\\n\\nAnd don‚Äôt ever forget just as there is a GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth there is also a devil, a Satan that hates God and everything God as ever made and that means he Hates YOU and wants to deceive and trick you into believing ANYTHING except Jesus and His salvation through the cross.  Though we should never fear for God is in complete control even when we have to walk through pain in this life for a season and the devil will soon be forever in his torment and punishment.\\n\\nSome great scriptures to look up and read below:\\n\\n1 Corinthians 6:9-11\\n1 Corinthians 15:1-4\\n1 John 3:7-15\\nMicah 6:8\\nActs 17:3\\nActs 18:5\\nJohn 4:25-26\\nMark 14:61-62\\nRevelation chapters 20-22\\nThe entire New Testament",0,0

qDhbIEuwRRc,So happy you guys did a Big Little Lies piece. Another profound thing from this show is the idea of inherited evil being false. \n\nThe show brings up a couple times if there's something in Ziggys past that could be violent going as far as to ask who his father was because Ziggy just looks like an empathetic nurturing child. \n\nIn the end the ones who end up violent are the ones who live with the violence in their home. Not Ziggy.,21,1

Getting things to make a rifle automatic is easier than learning how to make a decent sized bomb I presume, that's why we see more mass shootings than bombings in America because it's easier to use and buy a gun than it is to make a large bomb. Taking away guns nor making back round or mental checks is going to stop things like this from happening again, people with patients can do anything (good or bad). Its impossible to stop people from getting guns and it's impossible to know how people are going to use them.\\n\\nIf people out there really want things like this to stop happening ( which it won't, crazy people are everywhere) people need to realize that stoping individuals from buying any type of gun is going to do Absolutely Nothing.",0,0

ORSMs7lZtdY,"I think the shots came from the ground based on the noise level  and  the lack of evidence to the contrary such as pictures of bullet holes anywhere especially on the ground..

In the video reports the rat tat tat sounded very local and very odd,not like they are coming from a distance.   More like a Gatling gun or multiple sprays.   I doubted this narrative from the start. It sounded very real at first and then the facts started tripping over each other faster and faster. A lone wolf gunman - then the gun numbers started shooting up from 1-23 at last count. What does that tell us?  His female accomplice story kept changing. I wasn't sure at first if it was just crisis actors or if it involved real murder with an Oswald twist.

Whites exploit others talent, ideas, inventions, money, music, work, property, etcetera and claim ownership. That is why I never fill out surveys or do more than necessary when Whites are involved in my meetings, directly or indirectly. 2) Look up Neanderthal DNA or Monkey Rhesus DNA in Whites. Why are Whites prone to more internal disorders and skin diseases because of much lower melanin levels? 3) Google White mutant genes, which are inferior biologically which produce a physically inferior product that burns in the Sun, even with their chemical sunscreen--VAMPIRES. White scientists reveal Whites age more and have more cases of arthritis, Autism, eye seeing disorders(the need for regular and UV glasses)and hearing disorders(the need for hearing aids) compared to Blacks. Why are Whites having more plastic surgery, organ transplants, Testosterone or hormonal injections to mitigate these abnormalities. 4)CRIMES, CRIMES, AND CRIMES: Whites make a declining 14% of world pop., but commit more crime than any race and its effect Millions of people compared to Blacks. Whites commit more robbery and theft: white collar crimes, fraud, ethic violations, political corruption, and extortion.  Whites commit more Murder with evidence of the Indians, Holocaust, lynchings, frivolous wars, documented police killings, documented doctors' killings of patients, even White on White crime, etcetera. 5) White Supremacists hate diversity because it isThe end of the White Race. If Whites were truly superior, they could thrive in any and under all conditions, and among all people because all non-whites are Inferior--right? 6) If White is beautiful and right, why a billion dollar tanning industry and melanin injections? LOL! 7) Whites do more drugs: Opium and Heroin, Cocaine, Prescriptions, Meth, Hallucinogens, Amphetamines, Morphine, and Alcohol. 8) Whites are Secretly on more welfare, disability, unemployment, and file more bankruptcies compared to others. 9) There are other sources of entertainment besides Incest, Beastality, and deceptive superiority, so use them! 10) Last, Blacks are diverted from certain areas of expertise or professions and for good reason. The shadow government does not want black people to go into areas of Archaeology, Egyptology, Biochemistry, Law, Medicine, etc. in large numbers because expertise in these fields will show black people just how fraudulent the world‚Äôs current paradigm really is. \\n\\nGuys my fingers are tired and feelings may get hurt, but the list goes on with numerous evidence. Elephants don't swap flies, but I'll remind Whites to go back to the cave in Europe to continue dying out, regardless of the Sun!\\n\\nNonetheless, White Supremacists typically will deny everything, deflect, use opinions and circular logic while shifting the blame to Blacks or non-whites.

ORSMs7lZtdY,"I live in texas.I grew up with guns but my father is one of the most responsible gun owners I know. He owns about 4 handguns. He has the legal permits to carry concealed weapons and has had the proper safety training. My dad doesn't hunt but owns guns because he enjoys going to the shooting range. I think this is perfectly fine. I don't believe in taking away people's firearms but I do believe we need more responsible gun owners like my father in terms of the law. I don't think people on the no fly list should have guns nor do think people who receive federal funds for mental issues should have guns. I also don't think people need assault rifles outside of a controlled environment like a shooting range or for the military/ top law enforcement officials.

The actual facts of the case implicate the FBI selling weapons to ISIS terrorists much like Fast/Furious, and directly enabling ISIS to commit mass murder in Las Vegas.This investigation needs to be opened to the public, the FBI involved in this all need to be prosecuted for treason, and Trump needs to crack down on this kind of bullshit.\\n\\nSurveillance footage would immediately confirm this theory, we should demand that all relevant surveillance be released to the public.

po5VUW3I8P8,Wonder if you could attach a load sensor between the tool post and the tool to detect the load variations on the tool. if you can have it detect chatter something like a knock sensor in a car you could just automatically retard the machine speed till chatter stops,1,0
po5VUW3I8P8,"I used to program a CNC lathe from the late 80s (G&L, proprietary controller) where you could do this; the folks claiming HAAS invented the idea is hilarious.  It also had a knob you could turn to adjust RPMs, which the operators would adjust up and down continuously on passes that unexpectedly had chatter.  Increasing depth of cut often helped, as well, so we might program our cuts to increase in depth one pass then go straight across on the second (also helps with insert wear).  Some of our boring bars had semi-hollow centers so another engineer once dropped a stack of coins inside (... BIG boring bars) on a particularly bad project which actually helped so if your tools have a cavity perhaps putting some sand or BBs inside would help.",0,0

qDhbIEuwRRc,So happy you guys did a Big Little Lies piece. Another profound thing from this show is the idea of inherited evil being false. \n\nThe show brings up a couple times if there's something in Ziggys past that could be violent going as far as to ask who his father was because Ziggy just looks like an empathetic nurturing child. \n\nIn the end the ones who end up violent are the ones who live with the violence in their home. Not Ziggy.,38,1

qDhbIEuwRRc,"Excellent video. You really nailed down what I find to be most poignant about this story. I was first introduced to Big Little Lies as an audiobook, which was narrated by an Australian woman (since the author is Australian and the book was initially set there), so it took quite a bit of adjustment for me to get used to seeing the same story in an American setting. Sure you still had the divine Nicole Kidman representing the Aussies, but I worried that something could be lost in adaptation. My fears were completely unfounded as the show actually improved on the book in a number of ways. Many of the complexities were better illustrated in a visual medium than in a book.",1,0

z5Wo-iF6lA8,"Want to know for sure that you are going to Heaven when you die? (and everyone dies)  \\n\\nJesus is the Son of the Living GOD.  The only true GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth and there can only be ONE God that actually created everything, not many... \\n\\nJesus Died, was Buried and Rose from the dead on the third day, proving He is GOD.\\n\\nJesus said in John 14:6; Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúI am The Way, The Truth, and The Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.‚Äù  NKJV\\n\\nActs 4:12 states; Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name [Jesus] under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.  NKJV\\n\\nJesus said in John 3:16-17; For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world (YOU) that He even gave His One and only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him as Savior shall not perish, but have eternal life.  For God did not send the Son into the world to judge and condemn the world, that is, to initiate the final judgment of the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.  AMP\\n\\nJesus said in John 3:3; I assure you and most solemnly say to you, unless a person is Born Again, reborn from above, spiritually transformed, renewed, sanctified, he cannot ever see and experience the kingdom of God.  AMP\\n\\nRomans 10:9-11 states; that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, ‚ÄúWhoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.  NKJV\\n\\nRomans 10:13 states; For ‚Äúwhoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.‚Äù  NKJV\\n\\n1 Corinthians 15:1-5 states; Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you‚Äîunless you believed in vain.  3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ Died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was Buried, and that He Rose Again the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.  NKJV\\n\\nAnd REPENT...\\n\\nActs 17:30 Therefore God overlooked and disregarded the former ages of ignorance; but now He commands all people everywhere to REPENT [that is, to change their old way of thinking, to regret their past sins, and to seek God‚Äôs purpose for their lives].  AMP\\n\\nJesus said in Mark 1:15 ‚ÄúThe [appointed period of] time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; REPENT [change your inner self‚Äîyour old way of thinking, regret past sins, live your life in a way that proves REPENTANCE; seek God‚Äôs purpose for your life] and believe [with a deep, abiding trust] in the good news [regarding salvation].‚Äù  AMP\\n\\n1 John 3:10 In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.  NKJV\\n\\nFrom what I have read we know how 8 of Jesus' disciples died and all 8 of those 8 chose death rather than to simply state that Jesus had not actually rose from the dead, that they were just lying, we made it all up.  Think about that!  Would you ever choose to be murdered to maintain a complete LIE?  No you would not.  You would say ‚Äúok, ok, it was a lie‚Äù.  They would not deny their Lord to keep this life because they knew they have eternal life in Jesus because they saw Him raised from the dead.\\n\\nPlease get in a quiet and alone place SOON and pray to Jesus that He show you somehow if these things above are true.  If you are sincere, He will answer you‚Ä¶\\n\\nAnd don‚Äôt ever forget just as there is a GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth there is also a devil, a Satan that hates God and everything God as ever made and that means he Hates YOU and wants to deceive and trick you into believing ANYTHING except Jesus and His salvation through the cross.  Though we should never fear for God is in complete control even when we have to walk through pain in this life for a season and the devil will soon be forever in his torment and punishment.\\n\\nSome great scriptures to look up and read below:\\n\\n1 Corinthians 6:9-11\\n1 Corinthians 15:1-4\\n1 John 3:7-15\\nMicah 6:8\\nActs 17:3\\nActs 18:5\\nJohn 4:25-26\\nMark 14:61-62\\nRevelation chapters 20-22\\nThe entire New Testament",0,0

Getting things to make a rifle automatic is easier than learning how to make a decent sized bomb I presume, that's why we see more mass shootings than bombings in America because it's easier to use and buy a gun than it is to make a large bomb.

ORSMs7lZtdY,"I think the shots came from the ground based on the noise level  and  the lack of evidence to the contrary such as pictures of bullet holes anywhere especially on the ground..  At first everyone said the same thing. Sounded like firecrackers   How much noise would even a loud weapon make from 1000 feet away - 300 ft.  in the air - in an enclosed building?   In the video reports the rat tat tat sounded very local and very odd,not like they are coming from a distance.   More like a Gatling gun or multiple sprays.   I doubted this narrative from the start. It sounded very real at first and then the facts started tripping over each other faster and faster. A lone wolf gunman - then the gun numbers started shooting up from 1-23 at last count. What does that tell us?  His female accomplice story kept changing. I wasn't sure at first if it was just crisis actors or if it involved real murder with an Oswald twist.   I now lean toward the latter   We all should have known immediately  it wasn't a random act.  Maybe the picture of Sleepy old man shooter is telling us all we are about to be rudely awakened!",0,0

ORSMs7lZtdY,"LICE-METH-HEAD WHITES are so ignorant and are only proud because they're psychologically brainwashed: You think White Supremacy is going to talk down itself. 1) Where is their evidence to support Jesus Christ and Biblical characters were White, or that Whites possess superior intelligence than others in the world. Whites exploit others talent, ideas, inventions, money, music, work, property, etcetera and claim ownership. That is why I never fill out surveys or do more than necessary when Whites are involved in my meetings, directly or indirectly. 2) Look up Neanderthal DNA or Monkey Rhesus DNA in Whites. Why are Whites prone to more internal disorders and skin diseases because of much lower melanin levels? 3) Google White mutant genes, which are inferior biologically which produce a physically inferior product that burns in the Sun, even with their chemical sunscreen--VAMPIRES. White scientists reveal Whites age more and have more cases of arthritis, Autism, eye seeing disorders(the need for regular and UV glasses)and hearing disorders(the need for hearing aids) compared to Blacks. Why are Whites having more plastic surgery, organ transplants, Testosterone or hormonal injections to mitigate these abnormalities. 4)CRIMES, CRIMES, AND CRIMES: Whites make a declining 14% of world pop., but commit more crime than any race and its effect Millions of people compared to Blacks. Whites commit more robbery and theft: white collar crimes, fraud, ethic violations, political corruption, and extortion.  Whites commit more Murder with evidence of the Indians, Holocaust, lynchings, frivolous wars, documented police killings, documented doctors' killings of patients, even White on White crime, etcetera. 5) White Supremacists hate diversity because it isThe end of the White Race. If Whites were truly superior, they could thrive in any and under all conditions, and among all people because all non-whites are Inferior--right? 6) If White is beautiful and right, why a billion dollar tanning industry and melanin injections? LOL! 7) Whites do more drugs: Opium and Heroin, Cocaine, Prescriptions, Meth, Hallucinogens, Amphetamines, Morphine, and Alcohol. 8) Whites are Secretly on more welfare, disability, unemployment, and file more bankruptcies compared to others. 9) There are other sources of entertainment besides Incest, Beastality, and deceptive superiority, so use them! 10) Last, Blacks are diverted from certain areas of expertise or professions and for good reason. The shadow government does not want black people to go into areas of Archaeology, Egyptology, Biochemistry, Law, Medicine, etc. in large numbers because expertise in these fields will show black people just how fraudulent the world‚Äôs current paradigm really is. \\n\\nGuys my fingers are tired and feelings may get hurt, but the list goes on with numerous evidence. Elephants don't swap flies, but I'll remind Whites to go back to the cave in Europe to continue dying out, regardless of the Sun!\\n\\nNonetheless, White Supremacists typically will deny everything, deflect, use opinions and circular logic while shifting the blame to Blacks or non-whites.

I don't think people on the no fly list should have guns nor do think people who receive federal funds for mental issues should have guns. I also don't think people need assault rifles outside of a controlled environment like a shooting range or for the military/ top law enforcement officials.

The actual facts of the case implicate the FBI selling weapons to ISIS terrorists much like Fast/Furious, and directly enabling ISIS to commit mass murder in Las Vegas.This investigation needs to be opened to the public, the FBI involved in this all need to be prosecuted for treason, and Trump needs to crack down on this kind of bullshit.\\n\\nSurveillance footage would immediately confirm this theory, we should demand that all relevant surveillance be released to the public.

Idk if you could do that with the vfd programing but if it was possible you could get a uniform surface finish when facing parts.

po5VUW3I8P8,"I used to program a CNC lathe from the late 80s (G&L, proprietary controller) where you could do this; the folks claiming HAAS invented the idea is hilarious.  It also had a knob you could turn to adjust RPMs, which the operators would adjust up and down continuously on passes that unexpectedly had chatter.  Increasing depth of cut often helped, as well, so we might program our cuts to increase in depth one pass then go straight across on the second (also helps with insert wear).  Some of our boring bars had semi-hollow centers so another engineer once dropped a stack of coins inside (... BIG boring bars) on a particularly bad project which actually helped so if your tools have a cavity perhaps putting some sand or BBs inside would help.",0,0

qDhbIEuwRRc,"You guys are great. I love your deep analysis into popular shows. I never thought you guys would do Big Little Lies tho. No one ever really talks about it, but the show was really good.",54,3
qDhbIEuwRRc,So happy you guys did a Big Little Lies piece. Another profound thing from this show is the idea of inherited evil being false. \n\nThe show brings up a couple times if there's something in Ziggys past that could be violent going as far as to ask who his father was because Ziggy just looks like an empathetic nurturing child. \n\nIn the end the ones who end up violent are the ones who live with the violence in their home. Not Ziggy.,49,1
qDhbIEuwRRc,"ScreenPrism I love you SO much!!\\nPlease do a video for ‚ÄúThe Witch‚Äùüôèüèº\\n(And also Houses Martel, Arryn & Tully) üòâ",22,1
qDhbIEuwRRc,"Excellent video. You really nailed down what I find to be most poignant about this story. I was first introduced to Big Little Lies as an audiobook, which was narrated by an Australian woman (since the author is Australian and the book was initially set there), so it took quite a bit of adjustment for me to get used to seeing the same story in an American setting. Sure you still had the divine Nicole Kidman representing the Aussies, but I worried that something could be lost in adaptation. My fears were completely unfounded as the show actually improved on the book in a number of ways. Many of the complexities were better illustrated in a visual medium than in a book.",3,0

Most die when they are 11-16 due to them not being able to take it anymore then doing something they shouldn't be resulting in death.",1,0

z5Wo-iF6lA8,"Want to know for sure that you are going to Heaven when you die? (and everyone dies)  \\n\\nJesus is the Son of the Living GOD.  The only true GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth and there can only be ONE God that actually created everything, not many... \\n\\nJesus Died, was Buried and Rose from the dead on the third day, proving He is GOD.\\n\\nJesus said in John 14:6; Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúI am The Way, The Truth, and The Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.‚Äù  NKJV\\n\\nActs 4:12 states; Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name [Jesus] under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.  NKJV\\n\\nJesus said in John 3:16-17; For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world (YOU) that He even gave His One and only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him as Savior shall not perish, but have eternal life.  For God did not send the Son into the world to judge and condemn the world, that is, to initiate the final judgment of the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.  AMP\\n\\nJesus said in John 3:3; I assure you and most solemnly say to you, unless a person is Born Again, reborn from above, spiritually transformed, renewed, sanctified, he cannot ever see and experience the kingdom of God.  AMP\\n\\nRomans 10:9-11 states; that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, ‚ÄúWhoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.  NKJV\\n\\nRomans 10:13 states; For ‚Äúwhoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.‚Äù  NKJV\\n\\n1 Corinthians 15:1-5 states; Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you‚Äîunless you believed in vain.  3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ Died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was Buried, and that He Rose Again the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.  NKJV\\n\\nAnd REPENT...\\n\\nActs 17:30 Therefore God overlooked and disregarded the former ages of ignorance; but now He commands all people everywhere to REPENT [that is, to change their old way of thinking, to regret their past sins, and to seek God‚Äôs purpose for their lives].  AMP\\n\\nJesus said in Mark 1:15 ‚ÄúThe [appointed period of] time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; REPENT [change your inner self‚Äîyour old way of thinking, regret past sins, live your life in a way that proves REPENTANCE; seek God‚Äôs purpose for your life] and believe [with a deep, abiding trust] in the good news [regarding salvation].‚Äù  AMP\\n\\n1 John 3:10 In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.  NKJV\\n\\nFrom what I have read we know how 8 of Jesus' disciples died and all 8 of those 8 chose death rather than to simply state that Jesus had not actually rose from the dead, that they were just lying, we made it all up.  Think about that!  Would you ever choose to be murdered to maintain a complete LIE?  No you would not.  You would say ‚Äúok, ok, it was a lie‚Äù.  They would not deny their Lord to keep this life because they knew they have eternal life in Jesus because they saw Him raised from the dead.\\n\\nPlease get in a quiet and alone place SOON and pray to Jesus that He show you somehow if these things above are true.  If you are sincere, He will answer you‚Ä¶\\n\\nAnd don‚Äôt ever forget just as there is a GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth there is also a devil, a Satan that hates God and everything God as ever made and that means he Hates YOU and wants to deceive and trick you into believing ANYTHING except Jesus and His salvation through the cross.  Though we should never fear for God is in complete control even when we have to walk through pain in this life for a season and the devil will soon be forever in his torment and punishment.\\n\\nSome great scriptures to look up and read below:\\n\\n1 Corinthians 6:9-11\\n1 Corinthians 15:1-4\\n1 John 3:7-15\\nMicah 6:8\\nActs 17:3\\nActs 18:5\\nJohn 4:25-26\\nMark 14:61-62\\nRevelation chapters 20-22\\nThe entire New Testament",0,0

Getting things to make a rifle automatic is easier than learning how to make a decent sized bomb I presume, that's why we see more mass shootings than bombings in America because it's easier to use and buy a gun than it is to make a large bomb. Taking away guns nor making back round or mental checks is going to stop things like this from happening again, people with patients can do anything (good or bad).

In the video reports the rat tat tat sounded very local and very odd,not like they are coming from a distance.   More like a Gatling gun or multiple sprays.   I doubted this narrative from the start. It sounded very real at first and then the facts started tripping over each other faster and faster. A lone wolf gunman - then the gun numbers started shooting up from 1-23 at last count. What does that tell us?  His female accomplice story kept changing. I wasn't sure at first if it was just crisis actors or if it involved real murder with an Oswald twist.

Whites exploit others talent, ideas, inventions, money, music, work, property, etcetera and claim ownership. That is why I never fill out surveys or do more than necessary when Whites are involved in my meetings, directly or indirectly. 2) Look up Neanderthal DNA or Monkey Rhesus DNA in Whites. Why are Whites prone to more internal disorders and skin diseases because of much lower melanin levels? 3) Google White mutant genes, which are inferior biologically which produce a physically inferior product that burns in the Sun, even with their chemical sunscreen--VAMPIRES. White scientists reveal Whites age more and have more cases of arthritis, Autism, eye seeing disorders(the need for regular and UV glasses)and hearing disorders(the need for hearing aids) compared to Blacks. Why are Whites having more plastic surgery, organ transplants, Testosterone or hormonal injections to mitigate these abnormalities. 4)CRIMES, CRIMES, AND CRIMES: Whites make a declining 14% of world pop., but commit more crime than any race and its effect Millions of people compared to Blacks. Whites commit more robbery and theft: white collar crimes, fraud, ethic violations, political corruption, and extortion.  Whites commit more Murder with evidence of the Indians, Holocaust, lynchings, frivolous wars, documented police killings, documented doctors' killings of patients, even White on White crime, etcetera. 5) White Supremacists hate diversity because it isThe end of the White Race. If Whites were truly superior, they could thrive in any and under all conditions, and among all people because all non-whites are Inferior--right? 6) If White is beautiful and right, why a billion dollar tanning industry and melanin injections? LOL! 7) Whites do more drugs: Opium and Heroin, Cocaine, Prescriptions, Meth, Hallucinogens, Amphetamines, Morphine, and Alcohol. 8) Whites are Secretly on more welfare, disability, unemployment, and file more bankruptcies compared to others. 9) There are other sources of entertainment besides Incest, Beastality, and deceptive superiority, so use them! 10) Last, Blacks are diverted from certain areas of expertise or professions and for good reason. The shadow government does not want black people to go into areas of Archaeology, Egyptology, Biochemistry, Law, Medicine, etc. in large numbers because expertise in these fields will show black people just how fraudulent the world‚Äôs current paradigm really is. \\n\\nGuys my fingers are tired and feelings may get hurt, but the list goes on with numerous evidence. Elephants don't swap flies, but I'll remind Whites to go back to the cave in Europe to continue dying out, regardless of the Sun!\\n\\nNonetheless, White Supremacists typically will deny everything, deflect, use opinions and circular logic while shifting the blame to Blacks or non-whites.

qDhbIEuwRRc,"You guys are great. I love your deep analysis into popular shows. I never thought you guys would do Big Little Lies tho. No one ever really talks about it, but the show was really good.",55,3
qDhbIEuwRRc,So happy you guys did a Big Little Lies piece. Another profound thing from this show is the idea of inherited evil being false. \n\nThe show brings up a couple times if there's something in Ziggys past that could be violent going as far as to ask who his father was because Ziggy just looks like an empathetic nurturing child. \n\nIn the end the ones who end up violent are the ones who live with the violence in their home. Not Ziggy.,50,1
qDhbIEuwRRc,"ScreenPrism I love you SO much!!\\nPlease do a video for ‚ÄúThe Witch‚Äùüôèüèº\\n(And also Houses Martel, Arryn & Tully) üòâ",25,2
qDhbIEuwRRc,I am going to watch this after the vid.,6,1
qDhbIEuwRRc,"Excellent video. You really nailed down what I find to be most poignant about this story. I was first introduced to Big Little Lies as an audiobook, which was narrated by an Australian woman (since the author is Australian and the book was initially set there), so it took quite a bit of adjustment for me to get used to seeing the same story in an American setting. Sure you still had the divine Nicole Kidman representing the Aussies, but I worried that something could be lost in adaptation. My fears were completely unfounded as the show actually improved on the book in a number of ways. Many of the complexities were better illustrated in a visual medium than in a book.",4,0
qDhbIEuwRRc,Excellent work!,6,0
qDhbIEuwRRc,Didn't think the show had such depths. A really great and insightful video!,3,0
qDhbIEuwRRc,"This show isn't my cup of tea, but anything this Screen Prism narrator talks about sounds delightful.",9,0
qDhbIEuwRRc,"i fucking loved this show, reading the book right now",0,0
qDhbIEuwRRc,"Just finished rewatching this show, so this video just came out at the right time. Thanks!",13,1
qDhbIEuwRRc,"I loved this show, but I honestly wish that it had been left as a limited one season series as originally planned instead of trying to find a way to continue it.  Sometimes it's best to let go and move on.",0,0
qDhbIEuwRRc,"So, yes... we were pitted against Bonnie and Renata by Madeline; but you realize the Bonnie thing is only about jealousy and is invalid. We shouldn't buy into that right from the start because we see it's inaccurate as soon as we meet Bonnie. Renata, however, is awful and it's made evident even without Madeline's influence. She truly was unbearable until she softened and changed her ways. I couldn't stand her for most of the show.",0,0
qDhbIEuwRRc,How was Jane able to afford that school for her son. She's a young single mom.,3,3
qDhbIEuwRRc,I actually had no idea of Bonnie‚Äôs abusive father until this video and I hope that is something they explode in season 2. I could only tell in the last few scenes in the show that something might have happened to her. Also they never explained why Jane moved from Santa Cruz to Monterey.,0,0
qDhbIEuwRRc,We learn that white people actually go through shit,0,0
qDhbIEuwRRc,"Throughout the video, I was wondering why you keep saying season 1 when it's obviously a stand-alone miniseries, but when you talked about that final voyeuristic shot of the mothers at the beach, I thought holy shit is it actually possible for this to get a 2nd season?",0,0
qDhbIEuwRRc,Shailene's a blonde now so is her character going to be blonde as well...hmmü§îthis show is like Instagram Twitter & Facebook users lives combined! everyone wants to appear perfect on the outside to everyone else & in person they're far from it!!,0,0

z5Wo-iF6lA8,"Want to know for sure that you are going to Heaven when you die? (and everyone dies)  \\n\\nJesus is the Son of the Living GOD.  The only true GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth and there can only be ONE God that actually created everything, not many... \\n\\nJesus Died, was Buried and Rose from the dead on the third day, proving He is GOD.\\n\\nJesus said in John 14:6; Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúI am The Way, The Truth, and The Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.‚Äù  NKJV\\n\\nActs 4:12 states; Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name [Jesus] under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.  NKJV\\n\\nJesus said in John 3:16-17; For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world (YOU) that He even gave His One and only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him as Savior shall not perish, but have eternal life.  For God did not send the Son into the world to judge and condemn the world, that is, to initiate the final judgment of the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.  AMP\\n\\nJesus said in John 3:3; I assure you and most solemnly say to you, unless a person is Born Again, reborn from above, spiritually transformed, renewed, sanctified, he cannot ever see and experience the kingdom of God.  AMP\\n\\nRomans 10:9-11 states; that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, ‚ÄúWhoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.  NKJV\\n\\nRomans 10:13 states; For ‚Äúwhoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.‚Äù  NKJV\\n\\n1 Corinthians 15:1-5 states; Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you‚Äîunless you believed in vain.  3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ Died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was Buried, and that He Rose Again the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.  NKJV\\n\\nAnd REPENT...\\n\\nActs 17:30 Therefore God overlooked and disregarded the former ages of ignorance; but now He commands all people everywhere to REPENT [that is, to change their old way of thinking, to regret their past sins, and to seek God‚Äôs purpose for their lives].  AMP\\n\\nJesus said in Mark 1:15 ‚ÄúThe [appointed period of] time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; REPENT [change your inner self‚Äîyour old way of thinking, regret past sins, live your life in a way that proves REPENTANCE; seek God‚Äôs purpose for your life] and believe [with a deep, abiding trust] in the good news [regarding salvation].‚Äù  AMP\\n\\n1 John 3:10 In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.  NKJV\\n\\nFrom what I have read we know how 8 of Jesus' disciples died and all 8 of those 8 chose death rather than to simply state that Jesus had not actually rose from the dead, that they were just lying, we made it all up.  Think about that!  Would you ever choose to be murdered to maintain a complete LIE?  No you would not.  You would say ‚Äúok, ok, it was a lie‚Äù.  They would not deny their Lord to keep this life because they knew they have eternal life in Jesus because they saw Him raised from the dead.\\n\\nPlease get in a quiet and alone place SOON and pray to Jesus that He show you somehow if these things above are true.  If you are sincere, He will answer you‚Ä¶\\n\\nAnd don‚Äôt ever forget just as there is a GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth there is also a devil, a Satan that hates God and everything God as ever made and that means he Hates YOU and wants to deceive and trick you into believing ANYTHING except Jesus and His salvation through the cross.  Though we should never fear for God is in complete control even when we have to walk through pain in this life for a season and the devil will soon be forever in his torment and punishment.\\n\\nSome great scriptures to look up and read below:\\n\\n1 Corinthians 6:9-11\\n1 Corinthians 15:1-4\\n1 John 3:7-15\\nMicah 6:8\\nActs 17:3\\nActs 18:5\\nJohn 4:25-26\\nMark 14:61-62\\nRevelation chapters 20-22\\nThe entire New Testament",0,0

Getting things to make a rifle automatic is easier than learning how to make a decent sized bomb I presume, that's why we see more mass shootings than bombings in America because it's easier to use and buy a gun than it is to make a large bomb. Taking away guns nor making back round or mental checks is going to stop things like this from happening again, people with patients can do anything (good or bad). Its impossible to stop people from getting guns and it's impossible to know how people are going to use them.\\n\\nIf people out there really want things like this to stop happening ( which it won't, crazy people are everywhere) people need to realize that stoping individuals from buying any type of gun is going to do Absolutely Nothing.",0,0

Its time for you to go as well. Gonzalez... Why haven't you improved for the last 6 years you have played for the U.S? Why is Zusi, Wondo, and Feilhaber in the squad? They should never be called up again. Remember Julian Green? Yeah I don't either. For all U.S soccer fans, stop thinking the U.S is actually good. What have we done to deserve to qualify? We got a total of 12 fucking points. That is terrible. Arena-Out. Gulati-Out. All players above the age of 30, get the fuck out of the squad.

But he cant carry the U.S on his own soldiers. Dempsey, you have had a great career but its time for you to go. I don't care about your goal to break the record. Tim Howard, your prime has passed. Its time for you to go as well. Gonzalez... Why haven't you improved for the last 6 years you have played for the U.S? Why is Zusi, Wondo, and Feilhaber in the squad? They should never be called up again. Remember Julian Green? Yeah I don't either. For all U.S soccer fans, stop thinking the U.S is actually good. What have we done to deserve to qualify? We got a total of 12 fucking points. That is terrible. Arena-Out. Gulati-Out. All players above the age of 30, get the fuck out of the squad.

If I feel like playing, I just have to look at him and say Ball!, and withing 5 minutes, he will be there with a ball, waiting for me to throw it.    He is a lot of fun.    Cats are better at fetch than dogs.  They never want to play keep away or tug of war.   And they don't slobber all over the ball either.",0,0

You‚Äôre Ugly AF with extremely low self-esteem, even though you‚Äôre an adult you get told on a regular basis about how ugly you are so it never gets better however you happen to be funny as hell. So what do you do? You do heroin to be able\\nto cope with and ignore the constant reminding that you should never pass on your genetic code. Because all you really want to do is love and be loved but you realize how much the world hates ugly people who let it get to them instead of acting like it doesn‚Äôt bother you because we totally picked to be ugly AF during fetal development.

An example is when you draw money from your bank, get home and check your account, but the withdrawal isn't there yet because your bank has a server that updates every hour or 2 hours..most should be every 5 or 10 min or instantaneously, but it is what it is. For the airline to have a kiosk that lets you edit your seating, prints you your updated ticket and then prints out a ticket  at the gate that doesn't reflect that change means they have a sorry update system.

rdXaw4EFGdk,"IN ADDITION to the one-sided comments, which have been true. P!nk with her one-sided feud with Christina also tweeted on Twitter about Christina being pulled over for Public intoxication in 2011: ‚ÄòOut of myself, Britney and Christina ‚Äì didn‚Äôt everyone think I was gonna be the troublemaker? Look Ma!!! No cuffs!!! Petty af! \\n\\nHad P!nk had let the shit go back when Lady Marmalade and Beautiful (which she also stated that Stripped was a carbon copy of her album missundaztood <- Yes she said it, P!nk said A LOT of shit about Christina) were done, it wouldn't have been a feud, and it wouldn't last that long. You notice P!nk said they hadn't talked in a while, because Christina didn't give a fuck. She was busy being happy with her own life and career (regardless of how people feel about it). She never publicly scrutinized P!nk after all these years. That's why it was so easy to let the beef go because Christina didn't give a fuck, and P!nk finally came to her senses to be a grown woman, and let it go.\\n\\nI mean her being a celeb, yes she can speak her truth. But you know when you make comments about this publicly it reignites the fuel of the feud. Regardless of if the two parties (The artist) have let it go, it starts a stan/fan war against the 2 artist's fanbase, and the person who didn't comment publicly the supposed perpetrator, gets a ton of backlash (Christina). So basically she started a feud with Christina again, publicly by involving others unsolicited opinions.",0,0

rdXaw4EFGdk,"Jesus is coming back real soon Jesus Loves U and he wants U to have a deep relationship with him and truly follow him. Following Jesus is the only way to make it to Heaven. Accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour and give him your heart and soul. Jesus is the son of God who created us all, he is our Lord and Saviour. Jesus is God, he is one with the Father. (John 10:30) God sent Jesus to the Earth to die for our sins to be washed away so we could make it to Heaven. The Bible tells us that if we believe in Jesus we will be saved but there are other things Jesus told us we have to do to be saved. We have to do his will. \\nHere are the things we have to do to be saved and make it to Heaven. I'm gonna list the Bible scriptures for everything and U can read the scriptures yourself and do your own research.\\n1. We have to believe that Jesus is is the son of God and that he is our Lord and Saviour. (John 3:16)\\n2. We have to accept him as our Lord and Saviour and believe that God raised him from the dead. (Romans 10:9)\\n3. Repent from all our sins. (2 Chronicles 7:14)\\n4. Be baptized in the name of Jesus. (Acts 2:38)\\n5. We have to have a deep relationship with him and pray to him and talk to him everyday. The only way to the Father is thru him. (John 14:6)\\n6. Read the Bible and learn the word of God. (Joshua 1:8)\\n7. Fast and pray. (Joel 2:12)\\n8. Speak the word of God to the ppl of the world. (Mark 16:15)\\n9. Do the Lord's will until we die. (Matthew 24:13)\\nOn Judgement day when we go before Jesus there will be many ppl who have prayed to Jesus and even done things in his name and Jesus will say to them depart from me I never knew U and they will go to Hell. This is why We have to have a deep relationship with Jesus and try to do everything he told us to do cause thats the only way we will make it to Heaven. (Matthew 7:20-23). We all fall short of the Glory of God and we are all sinners. (Romans 3:23) This is why Jesus came and died for our sins to be washed away so we could make it to Heaven. (Peter 3:18) Without Jesus we are doomed to Hell. (John 3:36) When we disobey God and sin, God curses us. (Galatians 3:10) God punishes us and puts curses on us to make us obedient to him cause he Loves us and wants us to do right. (Hebrews 12:6) Jesus sets us free from curses when we truly follow him. (Romans 8:2) Quit following everything else in the world like the Government, religion, schools, science, TV, movies, radio, and everything else. (Colossians 2:8) That is all ran by the Devil and his worshippers, the Illuminati. They lie to U and deceive U. Them and the fallen Angels who got kicked out of Heaven with Satan are trying to lead U to Hell. (Ephesians 6:12) \\nPut God 1st in your life. Never put anyone or anything before God, not your family friends job money or anything. (Matthew 6:33) If U Love Jesus then U hate evil. (Proverbs 8:13) Repent from all your sins. Pray to Jesus everyday. Pray to him for everything U need. (John 15:7) Pray to him and ask for forgiveness of your sins, thank him for everything. (Philippians 4:6)  Pray to him to heal U, give U peace, joy, strength, courage, protection, wisdom, knowledge, understanding, patience, direction, guidance, and for him to show U the truth. (Jeremiah 33:3) Do the Lord's will and he will answer your prayers.  (John 9:31) God gives us visions and he talks to us in dreams and shows us things. (Acts 2:17) When U die U will go before Jesus and he will judge U and either let U into Heaven or send U to Hell based on if U did his will. Those who don't do the Lord's will they will be sent to Hell. (Revelation 20:15) Hell is place where ppl will be punished and burn for eternity (Matthew 25:46) Heaven is a place that God has for the ppl who truly Love him. It is eternal paradise where U will be wit Jesus, the Angels, all the animals, and God's ppl forever. God says there will be no more death, we will have eternal life. We will not feel sorrow, we will not cry, and there will be no more pain. (Revelation 21:4) God says that we can't even imagine how amazing Heaven will be. (1 Corinthians 2:9) In Heaven we live forever, rejoice and be joyful forever. (Revelations 22:1-5)",0,1
