Seems to like puns, has a mechanical pencil collection, and names his socks (after Dark Horse comic book characters). Owns an Atari 2600 and brags about it to strangers.  Worst that could happen: Engineer. And gay. And better than you.\\n3. First time you met, he went in for the quick-hug, as if you were close friends. And then sniffed your hair. Although he doesn't stare at your chest, which is nice, he does stare at your feet. And said your toes are adorable.  Has a scraggly soul patch. Second-worst that could happen: He is confusing you for a girl he saw on Chaturbate. Actual worst that could happen: You are the girl he saw on Chaturbate.\\n4.  You keep running into him at improbable places and times. He acts like he doesn't see you, but gets nervous and runs away when you call him out. You are suspicious that he is a stalker. Worst that could happen: it turns out he's not a stalker, and those were just coincidences. Now you're bummed because you feel like maybe you aren't good enough to stalk.\\n5. He has a popular YouTube channel. You think it involves cats. Or cooking. Or cooking for cats. Whatever it is, he has a warehouse full of something called merch, which you think may be some sort of narcotic. Possibly for cats. He brags about his subs and says that he is way more interesting than a Pootie-Pie, whatever the f*ck that means. Worst that could happen: you end up being a groupie for team 10.",1,1

oePt4JgdyZo,"Rick isn't a narcisist, he is simply put just a nihilist. Let us look at the describtion:\\n>>Nihilism (/ˈnaɪ.ɪlɪzəm/ or /ˈniː.ɪlɪzəm/; from the Latin nihil, nothing) is a philosophical doctrine that suggests the lack of belief in one or more reputedly meaningful aspects of life. Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism, which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.[1] Moral nihilists assert that there is no inherent morality, and that accepted moral values are abstractly contrived. Nihilism may also take epistemological, ontological, or metaphysical forms, meaning respectively that, in some aspect, knowledge is not possible, or reality does not actually exist.<<\\n\\nImagine if you had a relatively normal human being, with access to infinite time lines of infinite universes with infinite possibilities while also being one of the smartest beeings in the universe - Rick often displays something, that could be seen as almost limitless knowledge. He is simply a character that has no limitations and is aware of it. A Narcissistic personality is a disorder which manifests itself already in a very young age. Rick on the other hand, simply decided to not give a shit.\\n\\nI like one theory that states that RIck is simply a character - the only character- that knows that he is actually a cartoon character. Now if that would be true, it would be really a way of breaking the 4th wall.",1,0

If Grindelwald was not the master of the elder wand because he was defeated before his duel with Dumbledore, how come Dumbledore became the master of the elder wand after he beat Grindelwald. I wouldn´t even mind this plothole so much, except it is almost the same idea THE CLIMAX OF THE ORIGINAL SERIES IS RESULTED BY!",0,0
VEoITVHfyGg,You just really destroyed my fantastic beasts experience...as if this theory is happens to be true..then I have already got the spoilers😔😔,0,0
VEoITVHfyGg,Before I watch the video... Dumbledore is the owner of the elder wand. Having suspicions about tom riddle...dumbledore simply repairs the wand for Hagrid and continues to teach him magic in spare time over the years (we all know Dumbledore doesn't really value the ministry of magic's laws)...he could have easily aided Hagrid in concealing his wand and repairing it.,0,0

VEoITVHfyGg,I love this theory!!!,0,0
VEoITVHfyGg,"You make it too difficult... Dumbledore knows due to legilimency that Hagrid didn't release the basalisk.  He knows Hagrid is being blamed for something he didn't do but can't change people's minds due to anti-giant bias.  So he has him kept on as groundskeeper and after himself obtaining the Elder wand, might have fixed it.  More likely however it is as his discussion with Ollivander states... He says that he still has the pieces to which Ollivander says he hopes he doesn't use them, to which Hagrid fumbles at the umbrella.",0,0

VEoITVHfyGg,"To SCB's defense, i saw Seamus' video 2 weeks ago and the theories are not exactly the same. I think it's a coincidence that they made videos about similar topics and I seriously doubt they would watch Seamus' video and purposely take the idea. Seamus talked more about how Dumbledore might have mentored Hagrid and SCB talked more about his wand and how it would've been fixed and predicting his role in the next Fantastic Beasts movie. Y'all are getting upset over something that's not a huge issue. I hope they come out and say something.",0,0

VEoITVHfyGg,Harry didn't win elder wand from voldemort... he won from draco malfoy,1,0
VEoITVHfyGg,"If Dumbledore was born in 1881, and the happening with Ariana was when Dumbledore just had finished his school (1898/99)– how is it possible, that the legendary battle between him and Grindelwald was in 1945 (Dude, that sentence...)\\n\\nReminder, after the sudden death of Ariana, Dumbledore struggled with himself around 5 years to fought Grindelwald, until the community literally forced him to. (Because he feared the chance, to find out, that he killed his own sister with his very own curse).\\n\\nSo, the battle must've been round about 1903/04. Or did I miscalculate?\\n\\nP.S.: Sry for my bad Grammar. My English sucks.. ^^",0,0
VEoITVHfyGg,"It's also possible that Grindlewald loses mastery of the elder wand before the duel, or that Dumbledor knows a trick to defeating the master of the elder wand. After all, the invisibility cloak is another deathly hallow and supposedly completely hides its wearer, even from death, but Dumbledor knew exactly where he was. Dumbledor believes that these items, elder wand included, are not really what they are said to be, but simply very powerful magical items. Thus, the elder wand is not impossible to beat, just imbues its master with a lot more power, making them a lot harder to beat. Therefor, all Dumbledor need do is be clever about it and also be powerful himself by a wide enough margin to make-up the difference. He defeats Grindlewald, becomes the owner of the wand and fixes Hagrid's wand.",0,0
VEoITVHfyGg,Loving the Woody and Buzz toys in the background by the way,0,0

VEoITVHfyGg,I would absolutely love to see a young Hagrid. And a scenario like this would be great. It would explain so much and add such depth to Hagrid's character.,0,0
VEoITVHfyGg,"As much as I like Hagrid, and as horrible as it was that Hagrid got blamed for Myrtle Warren's death, I agree with his expulsion because he did have a dangerous monster in the castle, even if it wasn't the one causing the attacks. Acromantulas eat humans, and having one in a school... yeah, Hagrid deserved to be expelled and should never have been a teacher.",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,WHAT IF a Filter is not a perfectly mathematical object and it interferes with some light and redirects it?!?!?!?!?!?,941,83
zcqZHYo7ONs,I... have to go and rethink life now.,1,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"There is no entanglement. Photons just don't experience time so when one filter changes the polarity of the entangled photon, it changes it throughout the entire existence of the photon.",1,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"Probably missing the point entirely, but what if the blocked sunlight is instead reflected/repolarized, such that some light is passing through at the requisite angle, because it forces it to, so at each filter it's effectively a 45 degree offset instead of a full 90 degree.\\n\\nAnd since one of the entangled pair is being offset by this smaller amount, it also forces the other to be offset as well.\\n\\nEDIT: OK, I guess you did mention a hidden variable being influenced by the filter.\\n\\nLocality I'm willing to say might be upended in certain circumstances. Same with realism. I also have no scientific argument to support my claim. Just one that seems to sound logically sound.",1,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"I really don't think that this kind of information is suitable for the lay public.\\n\\nMy education is in economics, so I'm comfortable talking both statistics and (most) other mathematics. But every time I see something about quantum entanglement/the double slit/etc, I just see a series of what I can describe as poorly designed experiments that (appear) to rely on unproven assumptions and build upon them. Clearly, they are not poorly designed; experts far more educated on the subject matter are doing them. The only thing I've really learned is that I have not been given even the basic information needed to understand let alone make a judgement about it. \\n\\nIt does make me concerned, especially when the information is given to the scientifically illiterate general public (one glance through this videos comments and you'll run into a deluge of pseudo-scientific babble). The reality is that information given to people without knowledge is dangerous (even if that's only in giving a false sense of understanding). Until the research is more definitive, this information seems to be best kept with the experts, however passionate they may be sharing the information with content creators and the general public.",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"how do you measure how much light remains after it passes through the last filter? what if that measurement would also work like a filter, then we also got the human eye that filters and the mind behind it, probably making a big thing out of something not really special or paradoxical at all.",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,Wasn't it proven that there isn't any hidden information/variable?,1,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,I think you should look at the shape of the sin wave. \n\nOdd example. Antifreeze poisoning. I know i know hold on. The cure for anti freeze poisoning is vodka. Lots and lots of alcohol. Why? Because your body will process the antifreeze as if it were vodka based on the shape of the two molecules. \nSo if a sin wave is within that 15 percent range it will probably pass through the polarizer because it looks similar enough. \nI could be wrong but didnt some scientist show that light has memory. Passing two seperate light sources through a crystal turning one light source off but the crystal still projected the same image.\nCould light essentially squeeze through modifing the path of the photon?\n\nAlso i would reverse your perspective on the situation. What does the light look like from polerizer c's view. The path the sin wave (photon) travels from a and from a+b would be different. \nJust a late night cant sleep thought.,0,0

You also have to take into consideration how big are the slits. If you filter horizontal reflections, waves won't be perfectly vertical. There will be a little bit of play! That's why when you introduce a third slit in between, the photons that bounced on the edges on the in between slit will have different polarization from the first one, thus it will pass through the third one... That's why when you rotate only 2 filters there is 2 positions that will block the light. But when you have 3 filters there is 4 position that will block the light.",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,"The rectiline filters that you are using for this experiment actually influence the light that passes through it! The ¨phenomenon¨ that you are observing actually is explained if the filter being a non matematical object that affects the light that goes through it.This property of matter of messing with light going through it in one direction or another is called birefringence! \\nImagine for a second that the filter pivots (absorbs then reemits) the light going through it just a little bit so that it aligns with the axis in wich it let´s the light through. If this is the case it makes sense that the more times you pivot it the more light will pass in the end! \\nThis is the concept behind some of your LCD screens! White light is always on behind every single one of the pixels of your screen. Between the front of your screen and the back there is a layer of liquid christals that block that light. When tension is aplied to a pixel little liquid christals allign with it progressively, that is to say that the christals near the back wall of the screen remain in their position and the front ones allign totally with it. Like this :  BACK   _\\ |    FRONT \\nThis acts like the series of filters now letting through a part of the light wich goes through a clored filter flies through the air and reaches your beatufill eyes you beautifull coment reader you!\\nTo be honest I m pretty sure that there are plenty of other experiments that disprove the hidden variables (I could name a few if I tried to remember em) but this one does not ... as you cant truly say that it is the same photon that goes in a filter as the one that comes out. (FYI linear filters like this are made just by having liiitle tiiiiny wires all parallel to one another, wires being great at absorbing electromagnetic energy will only let light through the tiny gaps between them and will spit out some of that energy in the form of light aligned with em ...)",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,"In the 1780s Immanuel Kant presaged quantum weirdness though he didn't know it at the time.  What Kant claimed in Critique of Pure Reason is that reasoning is a faculty of the brain, like digestion is a faculty of the stomach/intestines.  So Kant's claimed that if ever the mind is presented with data it can't physically digest then the data will be forever confusing and unreasonable. \\n\\nIn the 1780s the scientific revolution was in it's childhood, but at that point it did seem like data+reasoning was absolutely perfect and would never run into trouble. Quantum weirdness, like Bell's Theorem and double-slit experiment, et al, is, me thinks, showing up reasoning as being imperfect.

B_CHjYoqPUU,"1. Great looking, sense of humor, snappy dresser, likes to dance.  Worst that could happen: He's gay, and dating your ex-boyfriend, who you turned gay.\\n2. Stable job, good income. Seems to like puns, has a mechanical pencil collection, and names his socks (after Dark Horse comic book characters). Owns an Atari 2600 and brags about it to strangers.  Worst that could happen: Engineer. And gay. And better than you.\\n3. First time you met, he went in for the quick-hug, as if you were close friends. And then sniffed your hair. Although he doesn't stare at your chest, which is nice, he does stare at your feet. And said your toes are adorable.  Has a scraggly soul patch. Second-worst that could happen: He is confusing you for a girl he saw on Chaturbate. Actual worst that could happen: You are the girl he saw on Chaturbate.\\n4.  You keep running into him at improbable places and times. He acts like he doesn't see you, but gets nervous and runs away when you call him out. You are suspicious that he is a stalker. Worst that could happen: it turns out he's not a stalker, and those were just coincidences. Now you're bummed because you feel like maybe you aren't good enough to stalk.\\n5. He has a popular YouTube channel. You think it involves cats. Or cooking. Or cooking for cats. Whatever it is, he has a warehouse full of something called merch, which you think may be some sort of narcotic. Possibly for cats. He brags about his subs and says that he is way more interesting than a Pootie-Pie, whatever the f*ck that means. Worst that could happen: you end up being a groupie for team 10.",6,2

Most commonly, nihilism is presented in the form of existential nihilism, which argues that life is without objective meaning, purpose, or intrinsic value.[1] Moral nihilists assert that there is no inherent morality, and that accepted moral values are abstractly contrived. Nihilism may also take epistemological, ontological, or metaphysical forms, meaning respectively that, in some aspect, knowledge is not possible, or reality does not actually exist.<<\\n\\nImagine if you had a relatively normal human being, with access to infinite time lines of infinite universes with infinite possibilities while also being one of the smartest beeings in the universe - Rick often displays something, that could be seen as almost limitless knowledge. He is simply a character that has no limitations and is aware of it. A Narcissistic personality is a disorder which manifests itself already in a very young age. Rick on the other hand, simply decided to not give a shit.\\n\\nI like one theory that states that RIck is simply a character - the only character- that knows that he is actually a cartoon character. Now if that would be true, it would be really a way of breaking the 4th wall.",1,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,WHAT IF a Filter is not a perfectly mathematical object and it interferes with some light and redirects it?!?!?!?!?!?,1470,177
zcqZHYo7ONs,So if it gets brighter with every filter you add... why dont we add a thousand filters so its shining as bright as a lamp? We wouldnt even need electricity and yeah. Oh my god i came to another idea. We could use this to shine bright light on solar panels. But watch out. I did the maths and im pretty sure if we add too many filters we might create a second sun,1,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"This works with polarizing filters don't just eliminate light not polarized at a specific angle.

What if the filter interferes with the photons giving them a slight spin/rotation, not big enought to make them rotate a full 90 degrees thus no light passing when filters are perpendicular but enought that when enough filters are stacked, they actually allow more light to go through due to the spin by the filters.

zcqZHYo7ONs,"I read a simple book about how LCD cells work, and that explained the polaroid stuff by saying that any light that does pass through a filter between 0° and 90° will be polarized in the direction of that filter.

zcqZHYo7ONs,"Polarized light microscopy, which employs crossed linear polarizers, is widely used to characterize the morphology of materials (e.g polymers, minerals).  For example - an unoriented or amorphous polymer appears completely dark when imaged through crossed polars. In contrast, an oriented or semicrystalline polymer displays interference colors through cross polars as it alters the polarization of light that passes through (see birefringence). The same is happening when you insert a polarizer (also an oriented polymer) between the two crossed polars - the light exiting the middle polarizer is now elliptically polarized, which can pass through the third/final polarizer resulting in a bright image",0,0

It appears to be blocked, but it continues on it's way and can be activated by passing through any filters again.  This would solve all of the problems if I am not mistaken.",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"This is becasue you are thinking one way about cause and effect. Reverse your assumptions. instead of assuming it is the filter that effects changes in the light waves assume it is the light waves effect changes in the filter. Part of the light causes no effect and part causes an effect. You see light so the natural tendency is to follow the order you used, because of your ability to observe via sight. The energy in the light waves has to go someplace and you are not accounting for the blocked photons change of state. e.g. light to heat; being reflected; etc. which could easily account for your differences in numbers without entanglement. For example blocked is relative only to the photons that pass through as opposed to those that don't. Assume a partial reflection instead, and you have light passing through A that bounces back and forth between A and B and light passing through B that bounces back and forth between B and C. You are being confused by the simplicity of both your method and the set up, but your numbers do not allow for all possibilities created by that set up. Energy and matter don't just disappear but do change states.\\nThe problem is not in the theories but in the fact that humans make assumptions according to what they have been taught and how they assume the cause and effect relationship according to their preconceived suppositions.",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,"Why are we assuming that it should be 50%? It should be whatever the result is. On top of that, we KNOW that all of the photons that pass through the filter are altered in their polarization to the alignment of the filter. So why in the world would we assume that anything different would happen? Also, why are we trying to do the math as if the photons' polarization ISN'T modified by the filters when we know that it is?\\n\\nI'm so confused by all of the terrible assumptions being made.\\n\\nThe only thing this appears to absolutely prove is non-locality, which is a perfectly reasonable conclusion given we already know that space-time can be heavily manipulated by concentrations of energy, if not more than that.",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"I think that you are thinking about this problem in too much of a mathematical sense. In a polarizer, the photon only goes through if it has a different orientation than the film. By this definition, it is statistically impossible for any photon not to pass through the film (by principle that it is the same type of infinity that says that two things cannot happen at the exact same time given enough significant figures). This means that the polarizer has a tolerance for angular displacement of photons entering, and that the act of passing through the polarizer has an effect on the orientation of the photon that also includes uncertainty",0,0

So what if the photons are acting like  a flat board shooting through space and the polorized filter is like a slot for the photon boards to fit through. Now if you put down one filter it forces all photons to go through to be oriented vertically, and if you put another one after it that's rotated 90°, then no light would get through because the slots would be set horizontally. Now if you put a filter between them at 45° isn't it possible that the photon boards would be deflected from their original vertical course and be skewed slightly sideways? And then be skewed slightly sideways again once hitting the last filter? So instead of having to jump from vertical to horizontal it can go in degrees in between making it easier for the photons to jump.",0,0

And the underlying variable isnt presently real but was or will be, real. (also. should have put this in earlier but im tired of revisions... the only reason they are able to move in such a way would be because it is light itself. and only isnt detectable because it blends in with other electromagnetic fields and waves in the surrounding areas, such as the sun, for example... just something i pulled out my ass but yeah.)",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,The problem here is that it's treating all photons as equal (or the same) and they've all ready proved that they're not .,0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"This shit isn't nearly as complicated as you're making it.  When you pass a photon through a slit smaller than the sinusoidal height it rotates the polarization of the photon.  Imagine throwing a Frisbee between two poles, it either is at the proper angle to make it and get a kick in the direction of alignment at the same time, or it doesn't and bounces off.  Now picture this in a 9-d space where each of our 3 dimensions has another 2 complex dimensions bound to it - it just bounces out of reality and the vibration it leaves behind on the pole is the energy absorbed.  You don't need to lose realism or locality - you're just looking at the problem through a straw.  (Another hint: complex space is what you get when you have something moving faster than the speed of light - the photons just get kicked back in time.)",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"Locality is most certainly obeyed, we know that it must in order for causality to not be violated.  Classical Realism is wrong though, in the sense that the 'hidden variables' which people were looking for and which are excluded by these experiments only eliminate CLASSICAL hidden information.  In reality the Shannon entropy is NEGATIVE and it is the interaction of the photons and the filters negative entropy which produce positive joint entropy values.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEaecUuEqfc",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"What if the hidden variable is actually the angle of vibration of the light, and its interactions with filters is informed by that variable, and can also change this variable? Then, even in the entangled case, all our results make sense. Since the filter interaction operates on a cosine relationship, we would get exactly what we expect. The questions then are related to the difference in angle between two filters. The idea that the photon's state is multiple booleans relating to which filter it will pass through seems ill-posed, what is more important is the photon's angle. To make the entangled experiment more interesting, we should entangle three photons together, and pass them through all three filters simultaneously. Then our results would be interesting- if we see 72% of photons pass through all three, then we know there must be a faster than light communication between the photons.",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,Isn't it more likely that two linear polarizing filters 45 degrees apart form a quarter wave plate and create elliptical or circular polarized light? Circular polarized light would have a presence in both of the linear polarized planes and allow light to pass through the linear polarizing filter. Fun fact if you rotate the last (3rd) filter -45 degrees instead of +45 degrees (with respect to the middle filter) it blocks the light in the center. This create another quarter wave plate that reversing the rotation convention of the circular polarization from right to left blocking all the photons.,0,0

So I guess it's the total energy of the light wave (assuming I'm using this word right) is getting normalized to the polarization of each filter as it passes with the remaining energy absorbed by the filter.

zcqZHYo7ONs,WHAT IF a Filter is not a perfectly mathematical object and it interferes with some light and redirects it?!?!?!?!?!?,1470,177
zcqZHYo7ONs,So if it gets brighter with every filter you add... why dont we add a thousand filters so its shining as bright as a lamp? We wouldnt even need electricity and yeah.

I did the maths and im pretty sure if we add too many filters we might create a second sun,1,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"This works with polarizing filters don't just eliminate light not polarized at a specific angle.

What if the filter interferes with the photons giving them a slight spin/rotation, not big enought to make them rotate a full 90 degrees thus no light passing when filters are perpendicular but enought that when enough filters are stacked, they actually allow more light to go through due to the spin by the filters.

zcqZHYo7ONs,"This is becasue you are thinking one way about cause and effect. Reverse your assumptions. instead of assuming it is the filter that effects changes in the light waves assume it is the light waves effect changes in the filter. Part of the light causes no effect and part causes an effect. You see light so the natural tendency is to follow the order you used, because of your ability to observe via sight. The energy in the light waves has to go someplace and you are not accounting for the blocked photons change of state. e.g. light to heat; being reflected; etc. which could easily account for your differences in numbers without entanglement. For example blocked is relative only to the photons that pass through as opposed to those that don't. Assume a partial reflection instead, and you have light passing through A that bounces back and forth between A and B and light passing through B that bounces back and forth between B and C. You are being confused by the simplicity of both your method and the set up, but your numbers do not allow for all possibilities created by that set up. Energy and matter don't just disappear but do change states.\\nThe problem is not in the theories but in the fact that humans make assumptions according to what they have been taught and how they assume the cause and effect relationship according to their preconceived suppositions.",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,"Why are we assuming that it should be 50%? It should be whatever the result is. On top of that, we KNOW that all of the photons that pass through the filter are altered in their polarization to the alignment of the filter. So why in the world would we assume that anything different would happen? Also, why are we trying to do the math as if the photons' polarization ISN'T modified by the filters when we know that it is?\\n\\nI'm so confused by all of the terrible assumptions being made.\\n\\nThe only thing this appears to absolutely prove is non-locality, which is a perfectly reasonable conclusion given we already know that space-time can be heavily manipulated by concentrations of energy, if not more than that.",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"I think that you are thinking about this problem in too much of a mathematical sense. In a polarizer, the photon only goes through if it has a different orientation than the film. By this definition, it is statistically impossible for any photon not to pass through the film (by principle that it is the same type of infinity that says that two things cannot happen at the exact same time given enough significant figures). This means that the polarizer has a tolerance for angular displacement of photons entering, and that the act of passing through the polarizer has an effect on the orientation of the photon that also includes uncertainty",0,0

So what if the photons are acting like  a flat board shooting through space and the polorized filter is like a slot for the photon boards to fit through. Now if you put down one filter it forces all photons to go through to be oriented vertically, and if you put another one after it that's rotated 90°, then no light would get through because the slots would be set horizontally. Now if you put a filter between them at 45° isn't it possible that the photon boards would be deflected from their original vertical course and be skewed slightly sideways? And then be skewed slightly sideways again once hitting the last filter? So instead of having to jump from vertical to horizontal it can go in degrees in between making it easier for the photons to jump.",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,"It seems to me that the polarization of the light is being affected when passing through the second filter. Some of the light is rotated or shifted if you will, thus making it more likely to pass through the final filter, which would normally be like a wall because the polarization was not affected. So why couldn't you argue some mechanism for the filter affecting the state of the hidden variables once they pass through the second filter, therefore altering the probabilities to what you see?",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,What if polarisation is like trig and when light passes trought it the angle of the wave changes making it more likely to pass trough another filter working as almost an angular gradient. The more filters the smoother the gradient making it bighter,0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"This is so cool. I'm a physics major, and we literally talked about this exact topic, photon polarization and Bell's theorem, in the first lecture of my Quantum theory II course. Also don't think I didn't recognize that Dirac notation. I knew basically all of this stuff, or at least most of the theory behind it, already, but it's so great to see advanced college level physics be talked about on one of these big science channels that isn't PBS Space Time. They already do that. But none the less. Awesome video guys!",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"Why is it that we believe a photon only has the options of  passing or being blocked by a polarized filter?  What tests have been performed to rule out the polarized filter affecting the polarization of the light?  High speed objects don't quick changes, or right angles. What if it is like a bullet down the barrel of a gun?  At 90 degrees the bullet fails to pass, at 45 much better, and 22.5 better yet.  Using a series of angles we can create a curve to bend the trajectory of a bullet.  Why is it that a series of polarized filters can't be acting as a curve to bend the polarization of light that passes through it?",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,So we are all going to use the word theory erroneously now?\n\nThere is a reason this is called Bell's theorem. \n\nThe word you lot need to use is hypothesis.,0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,Is the light bouncing off the filters and reacting with itself taken into consideration here?,0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"*sigh* I mean light gets polarized as it strikes a surface right? Because of it reorienting on a surface, or glare, polarized filters are good at blocking it out. Could photons waving around close enough to the axis of the filter not reorientate like they do when bouncing off a surface? Why 50%? If it was one specific orientation, shouldn't it be a lot less than 50%? So it's probably reorienting those waves within 25% of the filter orientation rather than blocking out ones without the exact orientation needed.",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,"maybe systox25 is correct... but it doesnt seem fun that way. so hear me out. maybe, it is not as locally real as it seems, and if the signal between photons must be faster than light while entangled then would the hidden variable be a portion of time itself?  if we entangled them to ground them to move at the same time and space, then what if its through different space-time altogether. here me out... they behave in the exact way we already know they do, and its not the photons themselves moving through this alternate space-time but the signal between photons themselves for a brief (and i mean faster than light brief) amount of time that causes them to behave this way. And the underlying variable isnt presently real but was or will be, real. (also. should have put this in earlier but im tired of revisions... the only reason they are able to move in such a way would be because it is light itself. and only isnt detectable because it blends in with other electromagnetic fields and waves in the surrounding areas, such as the sun, for example... just something i pulled out my ass but yeah.)",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,The problem here is that it's treating all photons as equal (or the same) and they've all ready proved that they're not .,0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"This shit isn't nearly as complicated as you're making it.  When you pass a photon through a slit smaller than the sinusoidal height it rotates the polarization of the photon.  Imagine throwing a Frisbee between two poles, it either is at the proper angle to make it and get a kick in the direction of alignment at the same time, or it doesn't and bounces off.  Now picture this in a 9-d space where each of our 3 dimensions has another 2 complex dimensions bound to it - it just bounces out of reality and the vibration it leaves behind on the pole is the energy absorbed.  You don't need to lose realism or locality - you're just looking at the problem through a straw.  (Another hint: complex space is what you get when you have something moving faster than the speed of light - the photons just get kicked back in time.)",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"Locality is most certainly obeyed, we know that it must in order for causality to not be violated.  Classical Realism is wrong though, in the sense that the 'hidden variables' which people were looking for and which are excluded by these experiments only eliminate CLASSICAL hidden information.  In reality the Shannon entropy is NEGATIVE and it is the interaction of the photons and the filters negative entropy which produce positive joint entropy values.\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEaecUuEqfc",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"What if the hidden variable is actually the angle of vibration of the light, and its interactions with filters is informed by that variable, and can also change this variable? Then, even in the entangled case, all our results make sense. Since the filter interaction operates on a cosine relationship, we would get exactly what we expect. The questions then are related to the difference in angle between two filters. The idea that the photon's state is multiple booleans relating to which filter it will pass through seems ill-posed, what is more important is the photon's angle. To make the entangled experiment more interesting, we should entangle three photons together, and pass them through all three filters simultaneously. Then our results would be interesting- if we see 72% of photons pass through all three, then we know there must be a faster than light communication between the photons.",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"You know, I'm so tired of the XXI mania of jumping to conclusions that anything you don't fully understand is either breaking the laws of physics or is in 2 controversial states at once.

And I think we are trying to mold it into something that our minds can actually perceive, and not how quantum mechanics truly works in its natural state.",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,Isn't it more likely that two linear polarizing filters 45 degrees apart form a quarter wave plate and create elliptical or circular polarized light? Circular polarized light would have a presence in both of the linear polarized planes and allow light to pass through the linear polarizing filter. Fun fact if you rotate the last (3rd) filter -45 degrees instead of +45 degrees (with respect to the middle filter) it blocks the light in the center. This create another quarter wave plate that reversing the rotation convention of the circular polarization from right to left blocking all the photons.,0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,"And it's not like we're absorbing the nonaligned portions of the photons polarization energy at each filter with individual photons.  That would create a red shift.  So I guess it's the total energy of the light wave (assuming I'm using this word right) is getting normalized to the polarization of each filter as it passes with the remaining energy absorbed by the filter.  Which I guess would mean that the filters are effectively destroying all the photons and recreating new photons that just happen to have the same statistical mix of wavelength and direction of travel, but with the new polarization mix.  Trying to make this work with classical physics is fun.",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,The percentage of photons that make it through a lens of set of lenses is the same every time. Doesn't that suggest order and determinism? And doesn't that go against quantum theory which seems to be about chaotic things like cats that are neither alive or dead?,0,0

368_ovPsJk8,The first thing I noticed was how the female lead seemed like she was sexually frustrated but more on that later. Then I noticed without fail the racist imagery. They made sure to add that scene in the trailer. When the black man was standing up for his wife and he was yelled at to sit down. He did so as if the know your place rule was in effect. Now back to female lead you can clearly see that the creature would be her lover later on in the film. Coded imagery with the creature having human like body parts arms and legs etc to take unknowing viewer away from the fact of the sex with a creature/animal. This film is nothing more then propaganda promoting racism and bestiality. Typical of European Behavior and Culture!,0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,WHAT IF a Filter is not a perfectly mathematical object and it interferes with some light and redirects it?!?!?!?!?!?,1835,242
zcqZHYo7ONs,"Filter appears to alter the polarization of the light. Also, unless the light is reflecting back, it IS passing through. Though destructive interference makes it appear as those it hasn't. You cannot detect EM waves at a point where they interfere to create a resultant null. Never the less the light is there, but so is light that is 180 degrees out of phase.",1,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"Light isn't a photon or wave, it's a field effect. It's the only  reasonable explanation for how it can pass through a solid object like glass without slowing down. It solves all problems associated with particle wave duality. Look up the Electric Universe. Classic cosmology is a childish mess.",1,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,Can you block the third polarizing filter with paper but leave a space where A∩B∩C to see if it doesn't redirect light from A∩B for instance to A∩B∩C?,0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,We need to report that bug...,1,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"So why can't photons just have a hidden variable that saves the angle at which it is polarized? \\n\\nEach time a photon passes through a polarizes filter it can either be absorbed or go through. When it goes through it just overwrites the photons polarisation.\\n\\nI would guess that entangled photons just share this hidden variable so that if it gets overwritten on one photon it also gets overwritten on its partner\\nA way to test it would be to get entangled photons polarized on A, then split them into different directions where they will hit polarisation filters B and C after diffrent times. Depending on which filter is closer you should get diffrent results. So if one of the entangled photons goes through B first (85% chance of going through), its partner should have a 85 % chance to go through C afterwards. If the photon was absorbed by B, there is a 50% chance of it going through. So in total it is 72.225% + 7.5% = 79.75% chance of the photon going through the second filter if B ist First.\\nAlso if C was hit first there would be a 50% chance of the photon going through, however the second photon would have a 85% chance of going through B since both are 12.5 degrees away from B.\\n\\nSo in if the entangled photon pair is polarized with A then:\\nCase 1: B is closer than C\\n85% go through B\\n80% go through C \\nCase 2: C is closer than B\\n50% go through C\\n85% go through B\\n\\nThey can't hit both filters at the same time, because there is no at the same time according to the theory of relativity.",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,"Question: How does the math work out if you assume that the light passing through the filter will re-orient itself in the direction of the filter rather than the light requiring some special property to pass through each filter? So if light is passing through an initial filter, then one offset at 22.5 degree, then the light will re-orient itself by 22.5 degrees. Then if it passes through a filter offset from the first filter by 45 degrees, the light's new orientation will be offset by 22.5 degrees instead of 45 degrees. That means the same percentage of light will be blocked as when it passed through the middle filter.\\n\\nOne way to test this might be to set up two filters oriented the same direction and then put a filter between them that is oriented at 22.5 degrees. If the light is re-orienting itself as it passes through a filter, then the light exiting this setup will match the light exiting the setup with the 0 degree, 22.5 degree, and 45 degree filters. If the light does actually rely on special properties to pass through these filters instead, then the result should be the same as if there were just two filters with the second offset by 22.5 degrees.\\n\\nI don't have any polarized filters around to play around with this, but I have to assume that this has been done. Which result do you get? Does my idea of what's going on hold any water at all?",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,"The anecdotal evidence suggests that the light polarity can be rotated. The shallower the angle, the more likely it is that the polarity will rotate. So it would make sense that if you have many filters, gradually rotating the light's polarity, it will pass thru the two out-most filters oriented 90 degrees to each other.\\n\\nKind of like riding your bike into a wall vs riding your bike up a ramp. Riding your bike into a wall means you crash. Riding your bike up a ramp means you can keep going. But the closer that ramp is to being as vertical as the wall, the more likely it is that you'll crash.\\n\\nI don't understand why light need be regarded so rigidly.

zcqZHYo7ONs,"Actually the explanation is very easy, you used wrong theory to explain and that what makes it so complicated. 1st polarizer dont blocks light they shifts the phase of wave.  And the real reason  behind the weird number is when u change the phase of light from 0 to 90  deg is like bending a metal to a complete 90 angle is much harder than bending to 45deg. And if its already been bent to 45 deg in first go then its easier to bend it further. the easier it is to bent the easier light will pass through . But why quantum particle may behave like a rigid body? Because of the newtons first law. They're in a phase they will try to be in that phase the more you try to bend them in single pass the more will be blocked. The more passes you introduce the more easily they will be bent and easily pass through. I think now you have the answer.",0,0

No hidden variables could make them behave identically in every possible situation -- unless each photon somehow knew in advance exactly what was going to happen later to itself and its twin. In that case -- knowing the future -- the photons could collaborate at the beginning of the experiment and decide what they would each do when tested, in order to make their results the same.",0,0

All light is traveling at roughly the same angle. Therefor a second 90 degree filter blocks the light at that angle. This 3rd filter in the middle in the middle changes the angle of the light because it's not a perfect object. Letting it through the second 90 degree filter.

zcqZHYo7ONs,"I think this should be experimented with point light, like a laser where there is no chance for any other source of light to interfere. This will also make light scattering and deflection easier to notice. It could also be that light is getting deflected variably and so with those two filters, it deflects in such a way that it doesn't reach our eyes at all and with the third filter introduced, it somehow manages to deflect towards our eyes. The angle can be responsible for the direction of deflection (somehow). And I don't think angle even matters. Take away those protruding sticks and simply make it round and circular, make the ring perfectly flat. Then you won't have any way of knowing which angle it occurs at. Why am I asking to remove it ? Well, because why to decide the 0° for an object which is the same 'internally' and basically is the same thing regardless of the angle you look it at from. The filter should be and is like a perfect circle. You can put the 0° mark anywhere and can change it for different filters, the only thing that should matter is that it completes a 360° which it obviously does. Then, this darkness will be visible even if the so-called angle of separation will be 0°.

And all the other degrees too, but it also makes sense that if it is like this than a slower change of the angle of the direction of the photon wave would preserve more of it, 12.5 degrees at a time rather than 25 degrees all at once, since that's a more drastic change that makes sense that the photon will have a smaller chance to survive",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,"It seems as though when the light passes through the filter, it orients itself in the direction of the filter.  When the light passes through A, it is oriented perpendicular to C, and thus no light passes through C.  But when you introduce B, it reorients the light so that it is no longer perpendicular to C, and thus can pass through.\\n\\nThis makes me think of things like procedural generation.  The more I think about it, the more quantum theory seems to indicate that the universe might actually be a computer simulation, and what's really going on is that information is being stored and compressed in such a way that some of it is lost.  For example, the universe can't remember the orientation of each individual photon, but instead uses an algorithm to probabilistically generate an orientation for each photon as it passes through the filter.  This could be why the orientation changes to match the filter, even if that same light had already passed through a filter.

This is messing with my head, like what is darkness is not always the absence of light as we think of it, but just like ions, photons can be + or - charged and so .... dark light...light, I remember a long time ago people argues shadows move as fast as light... in our visible spectrum thats just how we, as humans perceive this.

I suspect triganometry (I'm about to watch the relevant video).\\n\\nThat is, A and B interact and B and C interact.  But so long as B is in between A and C, A and C do NOT interact, you can't use the same interaction as you would expect from algebra because in this case (A+B) + (B+C) does not equal (A+C) because A and C do not interact.\\n\\nSo maybe the spooky interaction, or the entanglement, flows between pairs of filters.",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,"The wildest part of this, and the part I always love talking about with fans of learning, is what happens when you take those entangled photons and put three filters in front of one of them, an A, B, and C, each rotated 45 degrees from each other, so that the polarity of the photon rotates by 90 degrees. Then you pass it the entangled partner through a C, and see if it passes through. If the photons were really not entangled, the entangled photon would get blocked exactly when you would expect it to pass through, and vice versa! Entanglement is wild!",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"To me this seems simple. The filter itself is perturbing the phase angle of the photons just enough that more light can pass through a filter that's twisted slightly off axis, but a filter that's twisted a more extreme angle off axis still have the predicted blocking performance. \\n\\nThere are no questions the photons have answers to. I don't understand why scientists even wonder if something as basic as a photon has some sort of fate prognosticated upon it to determine what filter it will pass through. If you want to believe that stupid junk turn in your lab coat and go to church. The simplest explanation is always what you should pursue as an answer. Formulate a new experiment using different types/brands of filter material and precision light level measurement, I'm sure you will see differences in the amount of light passed by different filters even at the same angles.",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"What if it is similar to radioactive decay? When and isotope decays, not exactly 50% that decays, it is an approximate number based on probability, and it is very near to 50%, so no hidden variable",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,I don't get the different degrees.  its a circular lens so how are there any angles when you rotate it?,0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,can we conclude no hidden variables from this? no... you merely illustrated that light has an 85% chance of passing through a filter that is 22.5% off regardless of the photons history. in fact the effect of light passing through successive polarizing films is well understood and is not as hokey as you portray it,0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"The only honest answer when you don't know why something is the way it is, is 'i don't know' - you can then postulate stuff, but only when you can test it and demonstrate reliable results do you have any basis for belief, at least within science.

zcqZHYo7ONs,"Something is fundamentally wrong with your explanations. The answer probably a lot more simple. Like how a car takes a turn. When the speed is high the car simply can't take a certain corner anymore.   The speed of the photons is big enough and they could have a large enough potential that they want to go through, so if they can they lean left or right. You should experiment with different wave lengths of lights and different  distance between lenses to find out if there is a leaning capability and how big or small it is.",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,i figured it out. there is less of an angle change between b and c so more light can make it through from the first one,0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"I'm just throwing out something, but could it be possible that the angle of filter resets the 0 degree state? So after the first filter, it passes through the 22.5 degree filter, and the since 45 degrees is another 22.5 degree change, it would block another 15% that way, rather than the angle being stuck at the 0 degree.",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,Photons moving in a spiral shape instead of a wave formation would explain this wouldn't it?!,0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"Have you ever considered the fact that it was never passing through the filter, and that it has a natural/designated rotation? Meaning they have their own preference, or the first filter sets that preference.\\n\\nIf it blocks particles from 2 90* cones blocking 50% of light & *reorients it* to it's natural/designated rotation, That would rotate them 45*. If there's a second filter at 45*, 100% of the photons should pass through the third filter, because they're being put through the same exact conditions. This also fits with the 90* filter blackness, which makes it basically invert the block/pass cones.\\n\\nBUT this is disproven by the video; you may see @ 0:58 that the B and C filter diagram is strikingly close to the A/B/C, but you can see that filter B is nowhere close to 45*. If you oriented it correctly like @ 1:03 and compare it to the single 45* filter @ 4:42, it's actually much darker than just the 2 filters.",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"So, what if all of this is just a consequence of the filters changing the polarization of the light slightly? Or rather than that the photons adjusting their polarization to pass through the filter more easily. This would explain why more photons pass through if you add more filters just slightly angle shifted rather than having one with the combined sum of angle shifts (The photons will gradually adjust their polarization when passing through each filter instead of just attempting to change their polarization by a large amount)",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"If the outcome actually was random, you would end up seeing something like static on a tv channel that doesn't exist wouldn't you? Or at least when it comes to the amount of photons that make it through all three filters.... the uniform outcome of percentages based on the angle (though still unexplained) makes me think that it's the behavior of a photon that we don't fully understand. This experiment assumes photons travel in perfectly straight lines. maybe the filters themselves actually curve the photons trajectory in a uniform way because it is a uniform filter",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,"I might just be over simplifying this but if 0 degrees is 100% passthrough and 45 degrees is 50% passthrough and 22.5 degrees is 85% passthrough then having to 22.5 will yield a 30% passthrough. Do I have this right? Maybe I'm crazy to think intuitively that it isn't a cumulative effect. You could have, let's say 20 filters, at 2 additional degrees each time. You would have a lot of light coming through. Now take the last filter and change it to be 90 degrees from the second-to-last filter. Now you have 0% of light coming through.\\n\\nThis just doesn't seem to be that hard of a concept. Maybe I'm misunderstanding the purpose of the video.",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"1:33. Could this be used with one-way mirrors to improve solar panels? That would force all the light that would bounce off the mirror back onto forever until it all gets absorbed by the panel. The filter amps trick would magingify that a ton, I think...",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,"If all distances are equal between the filters for each test, and the filters are the same tone, size, and equality in glass; then I would say two more things need to be tested:  amplitude may change after the first filter, thus changing the results to be unequal and not as expected; and/or, a frequency wave as we always observe on a scope IS NOT 2 dimensional, but a 3 dimensional spiral, through the hills and valleys. Yes, would't that be an incredible discovery, that a frequency wave is actually spiral, like DNA or the solar system traveling around our galaxy, or so many other natural occurrences!!!!",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"As you speed up time slows down and stops at the speed of light. Theoretically going faster than the speed of light is back in time. I think of many theories that I can't contradict or prove with 9th grade mathematics. Also crossing the light-speed-barrier requires slowing down enough to come back from it. Acceleration and deceleration both take energy. Thus, our attempts to reach the past will end up in vain if we can't slow down fast enough forcing us to travel forwards in time as we decelerate from light speed. It requires too much energy. However I have another theory, If you move enough relative to huge chunks of matter (go fast for long) you move through time. Likewise if you move through time (relative to other stuff unlike trapped photons) , you move through space (to prove me wrong I dare you to be still relative to the moving universe.) Thus exists space-time. (This is how I theorized space time, before I knew it was a thing. I still don't know the real explanation) In the LHC the colide particles together so strongly that they release their strored energy creating new particles. Matter and anti-matter pop in and  out of existences all the time. Why can't we say that matter and energy are very similar? Just like space-time? Matter/Energy cannot be created or destroyed . It only changes form (I'm too lazy to write the laws separately but I still write this). Why can't they be a mix of each other always changing form and making more scientist confused? A particle with enough energy can more through space and time, fade in out of existence always interchanging between wave and particle form. Just looking at the speedy photons making you see. (If you manage to see a photons  I'm sure you'll win a Nobel soon) The have enough energy to cover the observable universe with extremely high probability of failure. There's only a few weeks left and I'm sure I'll hunt down my new science teachers for answers. But a reply from the people who helped continue on the path of curiosity despite the circumstances would really be amazing. Do I get better physics in 10th grade? What's calculus?

zcqZHYo7ONs,"Could it be that the polarizing filter doesn't block/stop the photons per se, but rather reorients the light?\\n \\nAssuming light behaves as a wave, it could be possible that all the light is passing through but cancelling itself until you add another filter, which disturbs the balance.\\n\\nBasically, 1st filter would change the orientation of 25% of the light waves, thus cancelling their inverse 25% for a total of 50% light blocked, then the second filter does another 25%, effectively blocking the rest of the light. Then the third filter making it brighter could be explained by the waves not actually cancelling each other completely (just enough to not be visible) and being disturbed/reoriented by [the 3rd filter] so as to stop cancelling each other and be visible again.\\n\\nMaybe the photons' funcion doesn't collapse until it has finished passing through all filters, thus being consistent with light behaving as both a particle and a wave, as experiments have shown it does.",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"Kinda similar to measuring the particles in the double-slit experiment, the lens is imparting changes onto the particles(realigning their spin). It's not a hidden variable to the particles but rather the known one changing. Only the state between the lenses should be considered, not the emitter to detector state.\\nJust in case, has this been tested in vacuum or various viscous substances to check if refraction has any role in it?",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,"So...the light wave gets turned/twisted...then you put a filter on top that is also turned...so you are basically just causing the particle wave to twist and turn down your filter tunnel, losing bits of light each time. Unless you turn it too far and just end up blocking all of the light.\\n\\nI'm not sure why all of the math is needed...that seems to actually make sense.",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,"Maybe physics (and quantum physics) has misunderstood polarization and/or how photons work. Polarization as we see in these experiments does not seem to 'block' any of the light photons, but instead just renders them invisible. Adding additional polarized lenses partially reverses this 'invisibility effect. Also, could this be related with the Philadelphia experiment? Meaning were they trying to create an invisibility effect using magnetic polarization of light? Considering quantum entanglement, maybe both particles must be observed in order to be seen or measured. They are pairs/twins like alter egos or bazarro superman and if one is not observed then the other is not able to be observed.

zcqZHYo7ONs,Light & matter interact simple 😏,0,1
zcqZHYo7ONs,The way I see it is you kinda change the direction.  Even thou a photo passes through a filter that doesn't mean it hasn't changed.  It's like a car kinda hitting a pole but still going straight (csuse its so fast) just at a slight diff direction but so minute we can't measure it.  But it helps it get through the other filter which would have blocked it if it continues going straight.  Maybe experiment where there is a large distance between filters will show it goes back to normal and does get blocked by the 2nd filter.,0,1
zcqZHYo7ONs,You are assuming the photon's polarization angle does not change as it passes through each filter. Looks to me like each photon is repolarized + or - a few degrees as is it passes a filter,0,1
zcqZHYo7ONs,"they sure take a lot of time, to tell that photons are affected by the difference between the angles between the two filters that they pass through...",1,1
zcqZHYo7ONs,is this joking? The answer seems so simply obvious,0,1
zcqZHYo7ONs,Montgolfier gas.  There is something we don't understand happening here but I suspect it is something simple like the polarization of light that passes through b is skewed so that is passes through c better than if it were not there.  I have a theory that most of quantum physics (time stretching due to gravity ect...)  is like Montgolfier gas.  We just don't have enough information to make accurate predictions and the predictions we are making are so bizarre that when we look back 60 years from now we'll marvel at how wrong we were.,0,1

pe3KSYqPIgo,"Little addition to the Tangled/Hercules connection: Rapunzel gets her magical hair from a flower that was created by a drop of sunlight. This flower heals people when you sing a special song. Apollo is the son of Zeus and the Olympian god of many things including the sun, music, medicine, light, and art. Rapunzel displays all of these in one way or another: the sun flower saves her life before she is even born, she heals people with her hair, she shows great musical ability despite being locked in a tower without any music/vocal lessons, her hair glows, and she's very artistic. Apollo is also involved in the Greek myth of the Hyacinth flower. Hyacinth was a mortal lover of Apollo. Apollo and Hyacinth were playing with a discus (a hard stone frisbee used in the Greek sport of the same name) when Apollo threw the discus and Hyacinth tried to catch it in an attempt to impress Apollo. Unfortunately, he was unable to catch it and he was struck in the head. The blow killed him and Apollo, grief stricken, decided to take his spirit and place it into a flower that he grew from Hyacinth's blood. This myth not only proves that Apollo can and will create new flowers, but also that he is active in the mortal world. Perhaps he decided that he didn't want Rapunzel's mother to die, so he created a healing flower from a drop of pure sunlight, a drop of his powers, that would cure her illness, and in doing so he gave Rapunzel some of his powers. I don't know it's just an idea, but I loved this episode even if I have seen some of the connections on the internet before. I saw the part about Rapunzel's powers having something to do with Hercules and my mind sparked.",1,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,In the case of entangled photons you only measure the ones that pass through A and do or do not pass through the second one (since the difference in angle between A -> B and B -> C is 22.5° both times it is basically the same only rotated). Which means you are only considering photons that are in a state that can be let through by A.\nIn this case you could put a filter with orientation A in front of every filter in the entangled photons test and the result wouldn't change since A -> A is 100%. This changes the entangled experiment to the one where they go through two filters in different time (the first one talked about in teh video) with the same results. \nMy point is that if you only consider the photons that pass through A in combination with the entanglement creates a subset of photons that are the same as if there were a second A filter in front every filter that is used in the entangled photons experiment.\ndoes that make sense? or am I wrong?,0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,I know why this is Happening - photons arnt actually passing through the filters - light is just a transmission signal similar to electricity and it's actually the emf of the signal that feeds back that blocks the light (electromotive force)  - block one angle and the emf doubles - and the either on the opposite side crates an anti phase resonanance which counteracts 50% of the signal which nullifies half of the signal - but if you clean up the emf by adding a third filter then there isn't as much emf feedback and thus you get a cleaner transmission and viola more signal gets through as you have decreased the end feedback :) no probabilistic issues just a misunderstanding on what light is and the way it works,0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,"You're making a mistake: the filters don't block or pass light; they absorb or polarize it. All light that passes a polarizer filter is polarized by it. The first filter polarizes 50% of all the light, and absorbs the rest. The second filter changes the angle of the already polarized light. cos(x)^2 of the light is re-polarized and sin(x)^2 of it is absorbed.\\n \\nIn the video, you place one or two filters after the first. The initial filter polarizes 50% of the light, and absorbs the rest. One extra filter at 45° polarizes again 50% of the light, and absorb the rest. The total amount of light passing the two filters is thus 25%.\\nTwo extra filters at 22.5° each polarize 85% of the light, so the total amount of light passing all filters is 50% x 85% x 85% = 36%.\\nLets scale up to 3 extra filters, at an angle of 15° each. They will polarize cos(15)^2 = 93%, making the total amount of light passing all filters 50% x 93% x 93% x 93% = 40%.\\nOr, lets use 45 filters, at 1° each. Now each filter polarizes cos(1)^2 = 99.9695%, making the total amount of light passing all filters 50% x (99.9695%)^45 = 49.3%.\\n \\nThe mistake you're making is assuming light with a polarization angle of x° keeping that polarization angle after passing a polarization filter. It doesn't: each filter changes its polarization angle, and thus influences how it reacts to the next filter.",0,0

It's not confusing or mind-blowing at all to me and in my opinion is not a good way to demonstrate Bell's theorem.

The fact that 45degree doesn't cut the light by 25%, but by a number related to cos, is clear indication that it is reacting as a wave function and not a particle.\\nThis interaction probably affected the polarization angle of the exiting light, which is something scientist should consider studying.

zcqZHYo7ONs,"The problem here is a logic problem and not a physics problem and this would indicate that the fundamental model of a photon, as stated, is flawed.  People tend to see light as either a wave or a particle since it has properties of both, but I see the possibility that light is a particle that moves at the speed of light, has two opposing poles and a rotation of the poles end over end (instead of rotating around the poles like earth).  Since the fields of the particles in the filter and the field of the photons can interact in such a way to alter the spin of the photons, you can have photons that come out of the filter with a different rotation then when they went in.  What if other particles were also similar and had two or more poles and its rotation of or around those poles, added with the direction of movement, could determine what type of particle it was?

zcqZHYo7ONs,"Makes perfect mathematical sense if you see the photon polarization as vectors. You calculate the amount of light that passes by breaking the vector into perpendicular components, one of the components aligned with the filters.With only the two filters, the second filter blocks the light entirely because a vertical vector has no horizontal component. Introducing a middle filter breaks  the vertical vector into two smaller components one aligned with the middle filter and the other perpendicular to it, the latter one gets blocked and the aligned one passes. Now the vector has a 45 degree angle, and this vector does indeed have a horizontal component that will make it through the final filter. Maybe physicists are overthinking it?",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,"My theory is that if the variable that determines if a photon is going to pass through changes for each passing, you have to look at each change in degrees between filters and not the sum\\n\\nLight passes through a 0º filter and then a 45º filter and losing 50% of light. There is a 50% change in degrees towards losing 100% light at 0º and then 90\\n\\nLight passing through a 0º then a 22.5º and then a 45º and having 70 % of light left makes sense because each change in filter-degree is 15% removal of photons. So two changes of 22.5º would equal 2*15% light \\n\\nJust like two 45% angles would probably equal 25% light and not 0%\\n\\nThis might be because filtering the light changes the polarisation of the photons or some other variable. So the change in angle affects how much light passes through rather than the sum of the angles. \\n\\nEven when you consider entangled photons, wouldn't this only change the result of the first filter passed trough. If the photons pass through different filters, and these filters change their polarisation or some other factor, how could you be sure that the photons didn't change in different ways after the first filter and either stopped being entangled or that the polarisation of the photons could change and be different from each other while still being entangled.

This video shows the 3 filter polarisation weirdness - filters clamping the polarisation with certain probability, as I understood(even weirder is the fact that only the other video explains why it happens). So, if the particles go through two filters in different time, the polarisation aligns to the last filter. But what happens in the entangled experiments, where they go through simultaneously? Is entanglement broken? Or are they aligned to both? Or do they keep relative entanglement, but each one is polarised differently?\\nOr did I misunderstand, and they don't get clamped, so they just keep the starting polarisation the whole time? But then I'm back to not understanding the 3 filter thing...\\nNot even sure if the entangled experiment is purely theoretical or not, but I feel like scientists wouldn't be lazy enough to not try adding a second pair of filters. I hope there's an adult around who knows, cause I don't feel like reading through several whole studies - this question is super specific :3",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"It's simple the photon Passing through the filters change it's wave length, that's why when A,B, and C filters are in there is more light than just filter A and C because the filter B twist and rotates the wave length of the photons which surpasses the regular wavelength being introduced",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,What if the polarity of the photons that get through is adjusted as they pass through the first filter?  This means the number that get through the second filter is highly dependant on the previous filter.,0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"Is it possible that the light is reflecting off of multiple angles causing the light to bend around the lenses? One of the factors could be the thickness of the lenses and maybe the angle of each ridge within the lenses. I am not claiming to know or even understand any of it. I was just thinking the reason they can let different degrees of light in at different degrees of rotation is because there are ridges blocking light and or letting it pass. So my thought is if it is being blocked by adding another lense the light is just projecting at a non visible angle, then when you add another the ridges of the third are reflecting the light back at a visible angle",0,0

I'm not sure how the filters or particles work in detail. However, the question pops up what if the wave is simply being changed or redirected? This would explain why stacking filters results in different behaviors. The start of the experience is what sparked this thought as the rotation resulted in different levels of light. Since the filters are at different rotations could this change the results? \\n\\nI would be interested in seeing a much more detailed experience using different filters, rotations, and maybe use of lasers to control amount of light.",0,0

2zISrf-7V3U,"My only concern which was brought up my one of my favorite people Nikki Perkins which is Nikki and Jamie Channel. Nikki's brought up that although giving a great review said the foundation is beautiful. But if you're  creating such a broad range of colors for every skin tone and very  dark-skin that she wish brands would make contour sticks for the darkest range of foundation . I absolutely agree and didn't ever think about for it being a struggle for darker skin tones.  And Nikki sister was one of Fenty Models I was screaming 🗣THATS DUCKIE👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽❤️❤️❤️❤️ I do think/ hope she WILL DEFINITELY have a lip-line, blushes,and more shadows. TO BE CONTINUED........",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,WHAT IF a Filter is not a perfectly mathematical object and it interferes with some light and redirects it?!?!?!?!?!?,2548,244
zcqZHYo7ONs,The first filter blocks 50% The Second 50% then C Blocks -50%.

zcqZHYo7ONs,"Here something:\\nWhat if a polarised filter doesn't actually block the light. Instead it just changes the dimensional plane on which it's polarisation is set to (there could me more dimensions than we perceive - look up string theory). This change would mean the photons on the new dimensional plane would  be undetectable to us (making the filter apparently block the light). However, when a third filter is added, it again changes the polarisation of the photons back onto a detectable dimensional plane, making it seam as if the light reappeared.\\n\\nWhat do you think?",1,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,Shallower filter angles somehow cause the angle of light wave to shift axially. Higher angles don't. Difference between a corner and a bend.,0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"Could this not also be caused by light scattering effects? Ie. That a filter maybe only emits light along a particularly fine alignment with significant degradation off the angle of alignment, and can accept light from a wider span of alignments with gradual degradation. So a pair of perpendicular filters is light confining the output to a range which can't really make it into the filter with successful scattering, but by having another filter in between at 45' offset, it's able to capture scattered light from the first filter and re-scatter it so that a portion falls along an alignment that's able to make it through the third filter.

This defeats the purpose of the entanglement test because it's still sequential to the original polarization of light.\\nTherefore, the % rate that pass through AB via entanglement is simply unknown as you do not know what the INITIAL hidden variable is unless you can actually perform the test.

zcqZHYo7ONs,"How do we know that the A filters, B filters and C filters are really oriented at 0°, 22.5° and 45° respectively unless they've been calibrated with each other beforehand? If they've been calibrated with each other beforehand, then you have information passing between the two locations and sneaking into the experiment to potentially interact with the photons. If they haven't, then you can't expect that any correlations will appear at all, even if you calibrate them after the fact.\\n\\nIf we propose that the amplitude that a photon will pass through a filter does not reside wholly in that photon, what happens then? I ask this because this calibration that you would need to do on these widely-separated filters (which must take place at the speed of light) is a way for some clandestine information to sneak into the experiment.",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"Awww, you missed your chance! 9:45 Unless, somehow, it did so faster than the speed of light, but that would be crazy.  Should have said, But that would be spooky.",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,"Id say that the universe is a simulation code made within photons as a quantum cpu instead of 0s and 1s, and what these lenses made is altering the code. \\nhope we dont glitch out and crash the program lol",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"I call this bloat logic. Clearly a polarised filter doesn't simply block a photon spinning on the wrong access but tends to align it to the filter's pole. So if you have a succession of filters that nudge the photon into a different spin, it will turn. All that math is just bull crap for train spotters.",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,have you took into consideration that the light adapts to have a better chance to go through. or better yet the shaders themselves alter the light wavelengths as it pass thought. this will show that after the first shade the second is at such a shift (90°) that light has only a 50% chance to pass though. but if you add a 3rd at 45° it alters light to give it a better chance to pass through.,0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,Could it be that the filter is changing the frequency of some of the light passing though (ie making them invisible),0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,the video is wrong. the filters do not absorbe the light,0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"I think one should have a look on the radiation pressure in front of and between the filters, that light might also be forced on another axis or spin that these filters cannot block due to their.. polarization. Somehow I also got that weird idea that Ohm's Law somehow is involved, like having parallel resistors, where the joint resistance is smaller than the lowest value,  resulting in a smaller resistor. I think this is sexy. By now.",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"Doesn't a wave propagate in all directions? So there is all angles all the time, it can pass through a filter and still travel in all directions after that.",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"Isn't it simpler to say the polarity of light is rotated by passing through a filter? A photon either rotates to match the filter, or is blocked. You don't need a hidden variable. \\nWith entangled particles, it's reasonable to say it's the same particle going forwards or backwards through time. So, from the particle's perspective, it went through one filter, became polarized, bounced off our entangler then went through the other filter. This can still maintain the polarity as the only variable.",0,0

zcqZHYo7ONs,I always wondered why when I tilted my head whilst wearing sunglasses car windows seemed to get darker! Omg seriously that question has bugged me for so long thank you!,0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"Since photons exist outside of time, from its perspective does it not travel through all the filters at once?",0,0
zcqZHYo7ONs,"Isn't it possible that the lenses are somehow rotating the waves of light so that they aren't exactly determined by the difference of the angle between the two filters? I mean if regular light hits a polarizer lense, only the light that is traveling at that specific angle will pass. but if you take another lense that isn't exactly opposing that angle some still can get through or be reflected off of whatever is preventing those specific wave angles, hence not 100% opposing to the last filter so some gets through. Another theory is that if light were imagined as a particle, its possible to have wave characteristics in multiple directions. if it were to oscillate along only the X axis then it would oscilate in a straight line, but if it were to also oscillate on the Y axis it would have a spiral effect on the particle. that spiral effect could determine whether it gets through the filter or not just by the mere probability that it lines up with the polarizer at the time it hits it. just a thought",0,0

Stop sinning and walk with God! God bless you in Jesus name!",11,10

4KAfi8-2tVg,"DO NOT WATCH ECLIPSES OR PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THEM!!!\\nmany people don't understand that the Sun and Jesus Christ are the same consciousness, this is why there are so many references to Jesus being the 'way, truth, and Light' in religious writing. Sadly, few understand that the 'moon' is the remnant of a destroyed planet that collided with either Earth or Venus around four and a half billion years ago. It's core and Earth's core are mixed together, this is why the core of the Earth is thicker/heavier than it should be for a planet this size. while the physical remnant of the collision is the moon, the remaining consciousness of this destroyed planet is actually the entity known as 'Satan' or 'the devil' and has been since the birth of our planet. Scientists have shown that gas giant planets can determine the order of orbit of smaller planets in a system with their gravitation....it can be deduced that the 'moon' or dead planet that used to orbit between Earth and Venus (this has been surmised by scientists for a long time because of the orbit of Earth being further away from Venus than it should be) has an evil consciousness of hate because it cannot forgive the forced that caused its collision and destruction. Therefore, this consciousness seeks to destroy every human life as revenge for itself having been destroyed as well. While it seems an innocuous astronomical event, the truth is that the covering of the Light of the Son/Sun of God by the evil force in the universe known as 'the devil', the moon is absolutely DEVASTATING to Jesus Christ, the Light of the world. It is as if he is watching millions of people revere and applaud the devil himself. This is why God allowed the monotheistic cults to take over mankind from the ancient traditions of polytheism, because humanity kept falling into moon worship; this is why there is a commandment in the bible not to 'worship any member of the heavenly host' (stars and planets). You can find depravity and sickness in every culture that had an aspect of moon worship, for instance the Incan fishermen that used to sacrifice living children to the 'moon God' by cracking open their chests and offering their beating hearts to this force of evil. Also much of the violence in fundamentalist Islam (including mutilation of children's genitalia) comes from moon worship as Islam is a cult of moon worship, which is why so many Islamic flags have the moon on them ( & also why every dignitary that travels to Saudia Arabia is asked to touch the moon orb, as Trump was pictured doing).",0,2

Hopefully, that happens with Episode 8 and Episode 9. However, I am not hopeful of that with Episode 9 for the same reasons that Kristian put forward. But as I said I don't agree with the petition to get someone fired as it really counterproductive. A Star Wars film is not worth getting someone fired over. Dislike for a particular film should be kept to forum discussions. What I would like to see is real and honest engagement between fans and Disney in terms of what fans want to see in Episode 9 and what they don't. That would allow the studio to see where they are currently with project and take it on board and that can really assist in determining what course they take. That doesn't necessarily mean they take onboard everything fans say.  I know you can't please everybody a hundred percent all of the time. However, what fans and DIsney should want is a film that sends the series out on a high note until we get the next three chapters somewhere down the line. \\n\\nI would like to George Lucas involved on set in some capacity - second unit director or something as a fittingly clever nod to the creator of the Star Wars universe. I would love to see Steven Spielberg direct one of the stand alone Star Wars films. The same goes for Ron Howard and John Favreau. You need to make it happen Disney as they would produce films that would absolutely crush their rivals at the box office.  On that note, if we get a stand alone Darth Vader film what director would one want to get the nod to direct? I was talking to someone recently regarding this and they said Guillermo del Toro.",0,0

wGwsgf5CdxU,"These comments on the petition site are comedy gold.  I love Star Wars, but the films do breed some of the most whiniest and unintelligent fans.  This is one of the worst (or best) one's I've read today:\\n\\n1.  I was disappointed and saddened by the way JJ Abrams destroyed the StarWars legacy that George Lucas put his heart and soul into. JJ Abrams clearly does not understand the Star Wars concept and is only interested in milking the already established good name of Star Wars (Thanks to George) to make money. JJ Abrams made the original characters (Han Luke and Leia) losers and completely changed the last 30 years of the star Wars universe basically giving the fans the middle finger. In addition to destroying the Skywalker storyline and everything that makes star wars worthy enough for Disney to want it badly enough to spend billions for the franchise, JJ Abrams did nothing more than plagiarize the original movies with pointless characters with no story behind them. JJ Abrams is running StarWars into the ground on purpose and clearly has no real vision for it. I was sitting in the theater 1978 when StarWars first came out. I have the expanded universe and introduced StarWars to my 6 children who have adored and enjoyed George Lucas 6 Star Wars movies and read over 20 expanded universe books. We are all upset with JJ Abrams thoughtlessness with George Lucas legacy. Please Fire JJ Abrams and suit him the damage. Please let Gareth Edwards remake episode 7. The Force Awakens was horribly done.\\n\\n2.  In theories of how to turn lead into gold, Abrams successfully discovered how to reverse gold into lead. He was given the golden opportuntiy in film making, to be Star Wars Royalty... the only greatness in this film was the visuals and vantage points in filming such as the Xwings flying over the water in the horizon. however dialogue was bland and the plot was redundantly blunt. shamefully movies are only viewed as success based on grossed rev, it was the long awaited anticipation that made fans nostalgic to fill the seats, and a new millenial era curious to see what the SW universe was about... not the quality that the force awakens is or reviews that spurred interest. it left authentic fans with plot holes and many whaaaa, \\nnoooo, moments, sure this is to induce interest in the next film, but there was nothing satisfying in this film. there was no climactic justice.. instead more simple tedious moments as in.. how did finn smear blood in the opening scenes if laser blasts cauterize wombs? How did Elite Tie fighters miss rey and finn running in a straight path on sand.. why does captain phasma lower the shields when troopers where traditionally cloned to be subservient and have no emotions, just to follow orders, therefor she shouldnt fear death.. meanwhile, this movie was littered with to many just in the right moment, timed action scenes like when Han finds his Millenium Falcon, or. R2 boots up from dormancy... also pretending the maps course makes sense at all..... However with this stated, rogue 1 was much much greater and a fan pleaser because it filled in plot holes pre a new hope, Lets add some new creative input, maybe at least limit JJ's roles to visuals, and get captain phasma to lower the shields to foil his plans.",0,0

No matter how unpopular a decision Marvel or Lucasfilm makes is with fans, you always stand by the studio. Always with the attitude of Well, let's just see how it  turns out. \\n\\nBut once it turns out the way fans feared, it's already too late. Case in point: Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo. You all know that he looks and sounds nothing like Harrison Ford. You, as much any fan, have every right to be skeptical of Disney's decision to cast him as Solo. And yet you never once commented on the huge fan push to get Anthony Ingruber cast as Han, despite the fact that the man actually played a young Harrison Ford in Age of Adeline! \\n\\nAnd that's just one example. Time after time after time, you side with every controversial decision the studios make. Disney in particular.

4KAfi8-2tVg,"DO NOT WATCH ECLIPSES OR PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THEM!!!\\nmany people don't understand that the Sun and Jesus Christ are the same consciousness, this is why there are so many references to Jesus being the 'way, truth, and Light' in religious writing. Sadly, few understand that the 'moon' is the remnant of a destroyed planet that collided with either Earth or Venus around four and a half billion years ago. It's core and Earth's core are mixed together, this is why the core of the Earth is thicker/heavier than it should be for a planet this size. while the physical remnant of the collision is the moon, the remaining consciousness of this destroyed planet is actually the entity known as 'Satan' or 'the devil' and has been since the birth of our planet. Scientists have shown that gas giant planets can determine the order of orbit of smaller planets in a system with their gravitation....it can be deduced that the 'moon' or dead planet that used to orbit between Earth and Venus (this has been surmised by scientists for a long time because of the orbit of Earth being further away from Venus than it should be) has an evil consciousness of hate because it cannot forgive the forced that caused its collision and destruction. Therefore, this consciousness seeks to destroy every human life as revenge for itself having been destroyed as well. While it seems an innocuous astronomical event, the truth is that the covering of the Light of the Son/Sun of God by the evil force in the universe known as 'the devil', the moon is absolutely DEVASTATING to Jesus Christ, the Light of the world. It is as if he is watching millions of people revere and applaud the devil himself. This is why God allowed the monotheistic cults to take over mankind from the ancient traditions of polytheism, because humanity kept falling into moon worship; this is why there is a commandment in the bible not to 'worship any member of the heavenly host' (stars and planets). You can find depravity and sickness in every culture that had an aspect of moon worship, for instance the Incan fishermen that used to sacrifice living children to the 'moon God' by cracking open their chests and offering their beating hearts to this force of evil. Also much of the violence in fundamentalist Islam (including mutilation of children's genitalia) comes from moon worship as Islam is a cult of moon worship, which is why so many Islamic flags have the moon on them ( & also why every dignitary that travels to Saudia Arabia is asked to touch the moon orb, as Trump was pictured doing).",0,2

wGwsgf5CdxU,"First off, JJ Abrams did not write the Script for TFA ,he Directed the Script he was handed to shoot by Disney, so that initial premise is total BS .If these Fans have an issue with the Film, then it is with Disney and NOT with JJ Abrams. That alone negates any validity the Petition has ,now if it said the camera angles were bad, the lighting the character direction or development then fine that could in a sense be hung on JJ, or at least argued. And finally, this SJW butthurt start a petition and crucify / vilify  anyone you don't like  thing is totally out of hand  and ridiculous.,I am ashamed ANY Star Wars Fan has bought into that , THAT is what we as Star Wars Fans deserve better than . And as far as that ludicrous statement  Profit can't be the yardstick  or however it was stated - LMAO, oh YES it can ,and is.Film Studios are a business Virginia, and they are in business to make MONEY. ,so you can grow the hell up in that regard, a critically acclaimed Film that makes no money is worth ZERO to a Studio. In short ,the whole Petition is based on a series of false pretenses , is ridiculous and a waste of time and effort. ,and everyone of you who signed it need to turn in your Lightsabers and GTFO .",0,0

wGwsgf5CdxU,"I don't agree with a petition to replace JJ Abrams. I don't like The Force Awakens, but I can understand why some people do. I feel Episode 7 I was a missed opportunity to take the story into new ground and really explore the universe with original characters and locales. Hopefully, that happens with Episode 8 and Episode 9. However, I am not hopeful of that with Episode 9 for the same reasons that Kristian put forward. But as I said I don't agree with the petition to get someone fired as it really counterproductive. A Star Wars film is not worth getting someone fired over. Dislike for a particular film should be kept to forum discussions. What I would like to see is real and honest engagement between fans and Disney in terms of what fans want to see in Episode 9 and what they don't. That would allow the studio to see where they are currently with project and take it on board and that can really assist in determining what course they take. That doesn't necessarily mean they take onboard everything fans say.  I know you can't please everybody a hundred percent all of the time. However, what fans and DIsney should want is a film that sends the series out on a high note until we get the next three chapters somewhere down the line. \\n\\nI would like to George Lucas involved on set in some capacity - second unit director or something as a fittingly clever nod to the creator of the Star Wars universe. I would love to see Steven Spielberg direct one of the stand alone Star Wars films. The same goes for Ron Howard and John Favreau. You need to make it happen Disney as they would produce films that would absolutely crush their rivals at the box office.  On that note, if we get a stand alone Darth Vader film what director would one want to get the nod to direct? I was talking to someone recently regarding this and they said Guillermo del Toro.",0,0
wGwsgf5CdxU,"Okay well as a Star Wars fan- did Disney Promise or pinky swear not to screw up those IP's, no. But doesn't mean they are as good as the original stories.

wGwsgf5CdxU,"These comments on the petition site are comedy gold.  I love Star Wars, but the films do breed some of the most whiniest and unintelligent fans.  This is one of the worst (or best) one's I've read today:\\n\\n1.  I was disappointed and saddened by the way JJ Abrams destroyed the StarWars legacy that George Lucas put his heart and soul into. JJ Abrams clearly does not understand the Star Wars concept and is only interested in milking the already established good name of Star Wars (Thanks to George) to make money. JJ Abrams made the original characters (Han Luke and Leia) losers and completely changed the last 30 years of the star Wars universe basically giving the fans the middle finger. In addition to destroying the Skywalker storyline and everything that makes star wars worthy enough for Disney to want it badly enough to spend billions for the franchise, JJ Abrams did nothing more than plagiarize the original movies with pointless characters with no story behind them. JJ Abrams is running StarWars into the ground on purpose and clearly has no real vision for it. I was sitting in the theater 1978 when StarWars first came out. I have the expanded universe and introduced StarWars to my 6 children who have adored and enjoyed George Lucas 6 Star Wars movies and read over 20 expanded universe books. We are all upset with JJ Abrams thoughtlessness with George Lucas legacy. Please Fire JJ Abrams and suit him the damage. Please let Gareth Edwards remake episode 7. The Force Awakens was horribly done.\\n\\n2.  In theories of how to turn lead into gold, Abrams successfully discovered how to reverse gold into lead. He was given the golden opportuntiy in film making, to be Star Wars Royalty... the only greatness in this film was the visuals and vantage points in filming such as the Xwings flying over the water in the horizon. however dialogue was bland and the plot was redundantly blunt. shamefully movies are only viewed as success based on grossed rev, it was the long awaited anticipation that made fans nostalgic to fill the seats, and a new millenial era curious to see what the SW universe was about... not the quality that the force awakens is or reviews that spurred interest. it left authentic fans with plot holes and many whaaaa, \\nnoooo, moments, sure this is to induce interest in the next film, but there was nothing satisfying in this film. there was no climactic justice.. instead more simple tedious moments as in.. how did finn smear blood in the opening scenes if laser blasts cauterize wombs? How did Elite Tie fighters miss rey and finn running in a straight path on sand.. why does captain phasma lower the shields when troopers where traditionally cloned to be subservient and have no emotions, just to follow orders, therefor she shouldnt fear death.. meanwhile, this movie was littered with to many just in the right moment, timed action scenes like when Han finds his Millenium Falcon, or. R2 boots up from dormancy... also pretending the maps course makes sense at all..... However with this stated, rogue 1 was much much greater and a fan pleaser because it filled in plot holes pre a new hope, Lets add some new creative input, maybe at least limit JJ's roles to visuals, and get captain phasma to lower the shields to foil his plans.",0,0

wGwsgf5CdxU,"I have a serious question for the Collider News Team, particularly the individuals featured in this video: Why are you all such shills for the major studios? No matter how unpopular a decision Marvel or Lucasfilm makes is with fans, you always stand by the studio. Always with the attitude of Well, let's just see how it  turns out. \\n\\nBut once it turns out the way fans feared, it's already too late. Case in point: Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo. You all know that he looks and sounds nothing like Harrison Ford. You, as much any fan, have every right to be skeptical of Disney's decision to cast him as Solo. And yet you never once commented on the huge fan push to get Anthony Ingruber cast as Han, despite the fact that the man actually played a young Harrison Ford in Age of Adeline! \\n\\nAnd that's just one example. Time after time after time, you side with every controversial decision the studios make. Disney in particular. And just for once I would like to see one of you have the backbone to call them out on one of their seemingly boneheaded decisions, instead of going after the fans who feel marginalized.",0,0

She had been in numerous lesbian relationships and even messed around with her female friends once in a while, which I honestly had no problem with. She was also surprised that 'studs' or other lesbians didn't intimidate me, unlike her past male bf's. You see, my sister is a lesbian. She told me all about the lesbian tricks and weaknesses that most posses. One of the biggest weaknesses is what was mentioned in this video, about not having what a man has, which is one major reason lesbian couples are always fighting. I honestly felt bad for her because she seemed so confused. She would get extremely jealous when her female friends would spend time with their bf's.

I've been openly bisexual for 9? years now and it's the biggest part of my personality that gets questioned and dissected and scrutinized and judged. Gosh, I just love that you posted this video. Thanks Hannah. ❤",0,0

dpMFGr-wznc,I was bi before I realized it was people in a general sense that I liked. Now I'm pan. I couldn't care less about gender. That has nothing to do with love. My parents came up with the how do you know? junk. It's so silly.,0,0

dpMFGr-wznc,"Male fucking privilege, if woman wanted either a man or a woman, it would be more common for her to choose a man not because of a male privilege , it's because there are more straight men then lesbians. Don't act like it's men's fault that you couldn't get a girlfriend",0,0

But who cares?! I am what i am and i like what i like. Its not the gender you fall in love with, its the person. Whether this person is a man or a woman. period.",0,0
dpMFGr-wznc,"I don't usually comment, but I wanted to say some things that, as I see it, people don't think really about. The thing about not being able to be enough to bi people is kind of contradictory because just like guys have something that girls don't, girls also have something that guys don't, so it goes both ways (I'm saying cis people in this case bc that's the majority of people that use this argument). A bi person (generally) is gonna like both/all, so it's not what's in your pants that's going to define whether you satisfy them or not, they're not going to miss one or the other. I can't speak for everyone, but that's how it is for me, it makes no difference.",0,0
dpMFGr-wznc,"Hannah, thank you so much for this honest video. and thank you for showing that you had your own prejudices before you could learn and grow to overcome them. as a bisexual, hearing the support from a prominent figure of the community means a lot. keep being awesome, your kindness is, i think, a role model for everyone!",0,0

dpMFGr-wznc,"Much like Ella, I, when asked, claim bisexuality, but I use the term queer for myself bc of the internalized bi-phobia that I got in middle school (when I was eleven/twelve.)

dpMFGr-wznc,"Here's what I don't understand about the LGBT community. Why is it, that they seem to think that their issues are the most important issues?  Sex is less than one percent of who you are,  and what your life should be about.  Eben if you had no rights to sexual reproduction,  it's still only sex. Sex isn't that big of a deal. Like Jesus fuck,  there are way more important things to be worried about other than your own fucking sex.",0,0
dpMFGr-wznc,Is this the woman from American Horror Story?,0,0
dpMFGr-wznc,I think this is generally a great video but I find the use of we're all on a spectrum in this context to kind of contribute to the whole bi erasure thing. Saying anything along the lines of we're all a little bi just kind of invalidates the identity to a small extent. It's hard to put the feeling into words but it's almost like hearing your identity doesn't make you special because everyone is that way which is frustrating because that's not true and the bi label is valid ? Maybe that's just me but it kind of rubs me the wrong way a little and I guess its just something to think about. But I understand that of course the intentions were good.,0,0

I think bisexuals get bombarded from all sides by people who question and doubt “what team they are on”, if they really know, and even attack their loyalty, integrity, and morals.

dpMFGr-wznc,"as a male, would dating a bisexual woman mean she's open to me hiring a hooker for a threesome? I would assume that would depend on their mood and other factors, A better way to word that would probably be, would a bisexual woman be more open to a threesome than a straight woman?",0,0

dpMFGr-wznc,"Being bisexual is freakin hard man! You get judged obv but also it's hard finding a partner, most lesbian girls i know in my country think we're cheaters :/ and straight guys that are a bit close minded think we're crazy chicks or weird dudes that don't know what they want, but also some partners want us to have a threesome which offends me tbh. Being single now makes me feel better about my sexuality and focus on other stuff. And being 100% honest about what I want and my bisexuality has indeed reinforced it :) some girls choose to be bicurious just for the fear of later on having a same sex partner or being judged, but You gotta be honest with yourself and take time alone to figure out what You want.",1,0

I really get upset by those in the queer community who feel like they are gatekeepers of identities/labels - you know the type, they use phrases like '*real* lesbians' and try to tell people they 'aren't *insert random stereotype here* enough' to label themselves as something they identify as. It's just bizarre, and something I wouldn't expect from people who have likely been discriminated against based on their own sexuality! Anyway, I'm not usually one to leave comments like this, but it just makes me so sad that bisexuals (and I'm sure many other people who identify as something similar) are treated badly by people who should be among their biggest supporters.",0,1

4KAfi8-2tVg,"Luke 21:11: * And great earthquakes shall be in divers places, and famines, and pestilences; and fearful sights and great signs shall there be from heaven.*\\n\\nLuke 21:25:  *And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity; the sea and the waves roaring*\\n\\nBelieve what you want, but prophecies are coming true. United nations will declare year of peace and security on 21. september this year. Look what Bible says:\\n\\n1Thesselonians 5:3:  *For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.*\\n\\nThen on 23. september the constellation virgo will have 12 stars above her head, sun on her head, moon at her feet and JUPITER WILL EXIT HER WOMB after 9 MONTHS! Guess what Bible says?\\n\\nRevelation 12:1-2: *And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars: And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.*\\n\\nRepent till it's still time, brothers and sisters. Take it serious as it is and don't believe people or megachurches, chatolic churches, organisations, cults.. Believe only WORD OF GOD and STUDY IT! Accept Jesus as your saviour and REPENT! Stop sinning and walk with God! God bless you in Jesus name!",12,12

4KAfi8-2tVg,"DO NOT WATCH ECLIPSES OR PAY ANY ATTENTION TO THEM!!!\\nmany people don't understand that the Sun and Jesus Christ are the same consciousness, this is why there are so many references to Jesus being the 'way, truth, and Light' in religious writing. Sadly, few understand that the 'moon' is the remnant of a destroyed planet that collided with either Earth or Venus around four and a half billion years ago. It's core and Earth's core are mixed together, this is why the core of the Earth is thicker/heavier than it should be for a planet this size. while the physical remnant of the collision is the moon, the remaining consciousness of this destroyed planet is actually the entity known as 'Satan' or 'the devil' and has been since the birth of our planet. Scientists have shown that gas giant planets can determine the order of orbit of smaller planets in a system with their gravitation....it can be deduced that the 'moon' or dead planet that used to orbit between Earth and Venus (this has been surmised by scientists for a long time because of the orbit of Earth being further away from Venus than it should be) has an evil consciousness of hate because it cannot forgive the forced that caused its collision and destruction. Therefore, this consciousness seeks to destroy every human life as revenge for itself having been destroyed as well. While it seems an innocuous astronomical event, the truth is that the covering of the Light of the Son/Sun of God by the evil force in the universe known as 'the devil', the moon is absolutely DEVASTATING to Jesus Christ, the Light of the world. It is as if he is watching millions of people revere and applaud the devil himself. This is why God allowed the monotheistic cults to take over mankind from the ancient traditions of polytheism, because humanity kept falling into moon worship; this is why there is a commandment in the bible not to 'worship any member of the heavenly host' (stars and planets). You can find depravity and sickness in every culture that had an aspect of moon worship, for instance the Incan fishermen that used to sacrifice living children to the 'moon God' by cracking open their chests and offering their beating hearts to this force of evil. Also much of the violence in fundamentalist Islam (including mutilation of children's genitalia) comes from moon worship as Islam is a cult of moon worship, which is why so many Islamic flags have the moon on them ( & also why every dignitary that travels to Saudia Arabia is asked to touch the moon orb, as Trump was pictured doing).",0,2

It doesnt fucking matter what ethnicity or gender the characters are as long as it doesnt interfere with story and plot... And lets assume it matters, like it does to you guys and disney apparently. Looking at todays PC society it's actually a safer choice going with as much diversity (god i hate that term) as possible, so all the racist and sexist people that hyper-focus on these issues dont feel excluded. No one gives a shit that the main lead is female or that finn isnt caucasian. what people give a shit about is this hyper sensitivity and disney's obvious fear of excluding anyone in a sci-fi space opera, its pathetic.. just make a fucking good movie and cast good actors.",0,0
wGwsgf5CdxU,Cant follow you on the Mel Gibson thing. I mean Im sure you guys all watched the Mayweather McGregor fight.

The Roman Polanski thing sure I totally get but to gets someone removed for saying something however insensitive is....kind of a snowflake move. Plenty of celebrities say stuff I don't agree with but ill support their stuff bc the art is separate from the artist in many cases.,0,0
wGwsgf5CdxU,"First off, JJ Abrams did not write the Script for TFA ,he Directed the Script he was handed to shoot by Disney, so that initial premise is total BS .If these Fans have an issue with the Film, then it is with Disney and NOT with JJ Abrams. That alone negates any validity the Petition has ,now if it said the camera angles were bad, the lighting the character direction or development then fine that could in a sense be hung on JJ, or at least argued. And finally, this SJW butthurt start a petition and crucify / vilify  anyone you don't like  thing is totally out of hand  and ridiculous.,I am ashamed ANY Star Wars Fan has bought into that , THAT is what we as Star Wars Fans deserve better than . And as far as that ludicrous statement  Profit can't be the yardstick  or however it was stated - LMAO, oh YES it can ,and is.Film Studios are a business Virginia, and they are in business to make MONEY. ,so you can grow the hell up in that regard, a critically acclaimed Film that makes no money is worth ZERO to a Studio. In short ,the whole Petition is based on a series of false pretenses , is ridiculous and a waste of time and effort. ,and everyone of you who signed it need to turn in your Lightsabers and GTFO .",0,0

wGwsgf5CdxU,"I don't agree with a petition to replace JJ Abrams. I don't like The Force Awakens, but I can understand why some people do. I feel Episode 7 I was a missed opportunity to take the story into new ground and really explore the universe with original characters and locales. Hopefully, that happens with Episode 8 and Episode 9. However, I am not hopeful of that with Episode 9 for the same reasons that Kristian put forward. But as I said I don't agree with the petition to get someone fired as it really counterproductive. A Star Wars film is not worth getting someone fired over. Dislike for a particular film should be kept to forum discussions. What I would like to see is real and honest engagement between fans and Disney in terms of what fans want to see in Episode 9 and what they don't. That would allow the studio to see where they are currently with project and take it on board and that can really assist in determining what course they take. That doesn't necessarily mean they take onboard everything fans say.  I know you can't please everybody a hundred percent all of the time. However, what fans and DIsney should want is a film that sends the series out on a high note until we get the next three chapters somewhere down the line. \\n\\nI would like to George Lucas involved on set in some capacity - second unit director or something as a fittingly clever nod to the creator of the Star Wars universe. I would love to see Steven Spielberg direct one of the stand alone Star Wars films. The same goes for Ron Howard and John Favreau. You need to make it happen Disney as they would produce films that would absolutely crush their rivals at the box office.  On that note, if we get a stand alone Darth Vader film what director would one want to get the nod to direct? I was talking to someone recently regarding this and they said Guillermo del Toro.",0,0

wGwsgf5CdxU,"These comments on the petition site are comedy gold.  I love Star Wars, but the films do breed some of the most whiniest and unintelligent fans.  This is one of the worst (or best) one's I've read today:\\n\\n1.  I was disappointed and saddened by the way JJ Abrams destroyed the StarWars legacy that George Lucas put his heart and soul into. JJ Abrams clearly does not understand the Star Wars concept and is only interested in milking the already established good name of Star Wars (Thanks to George) to make money. JJ Abrams made the original characters (Han Luke and Leia) losers and completely changed the last 30 years of the star Wars universe basically giving the fans the middle finger. In addition to destroying the Skywalker storyline and everything that makes star wars worthy enough for Disney to want it badly enough to spend billions for the franchise, JJ Abrams did nothing more than plagiarize the original movies with pointless characters with no story behind them. JJ Abrams is running StarWars into the ground on purpose and clearly has no real vision for it. I was sitting in the theater 1978 when StarWars first came out. I have the expanded universe and introduced StarWars to my 6 children who have adored and enjoyed George Lucas 6 Star Wars movies and read over 20 expanded universe books. We are all upset with JJ Abrams thoughtlessness with George Lucas legacy. Please Fire JJ Abrams and suit him the damage. Please let Gareth Edwards remake episode 7. The Force Awakens was horribly done.\\n\\n2.  In theories of how to turn lead into gold, Abrams successfully discovered how to reverse gold into lead. He was given the golden opportuntiy in film making, to be Star Wars Royalty... the only greatness in this film was the visuals and vantage points in filming such as the Xwings flying over the water in the horizon. however dialogue was bland and the plot was redundantly blunt. shamefully movies are only viewed as success based on grossed rev, it was the long awaited anticipation that made fans nostalgic to fill the seats, and a new millenial era curious to see what the SW universe was about... not the quality that the force awakens is or reviews that spurred interest. it left authentic fans with plot holes and many whaaaa, \\nnoooo, moments, sure this is to induce interest in the next film, but there was nothing satisfying in this film. there was no climactic justice.. instead more simple tedious moments as in.. how did finn smear blood in the opening scenes if laser blasts cauterize wombs? How did Elite Tie fighters miss rey and finn running in a straight path on sand.. why does captain phasma lower the shields when troopers where traditionally cloned to be subservient and have no emotions, just to follow orders, therefor she shouldnt fear death.. meanwhile, this movie was littered with to many just in the right moment, timed action scenes like when Han finds his Millenium Falcon, or. R2 boots up from dormancy... also pretending the maps course makes sense at all..... However with this stated, rogue 1 was much much greater and a fan pleaser because it filled in plot holes pre a new hope, Lets add some new creative input, maybe at least limit JJ's roles to visuals, and get captain phasma to lower the shields to foil his plans.",0,0

No matter how unpopular a decision Marvel or Lucasfilm makes is with fans, you always stand by the studio. Always with the attitude of Well, let's just see how it  turns out. \\n\\nBut once it turns out the way fans feared, it's already too late. Case in point: Alden Ehrenreich as Han Solo. You all know that he looks and sounds nothing like Harrison Ford. You, as much any fan, have every right to be skeptical of Disney's decision to cast him as Solo. And yet you never once commented on the huge fan push to get Anthony Ingruber cast as Han, despite the fact that the man actually played a young Harrison Ford in Age of Adeline! \\n\\nAnd that's just one example. Time after time after time, you side with every controversial decision the studios make. Disney in particular. And just for once I would like to see one of you have the backbone to call them out on one of their seemingly boneheaded decisions, instead of going after the fans who feel marginalized.",0,0

mceaM2_zQd8,"This is closely connected to something I heard a few years ago about how high dimensional objects have most of their volume near their boundaries (whereas low dimensional objects we are used to have most of their volume near their centers). I claim that you should never buy a high dimensional orange because it is mostly full of rind. Consider a sphere of radius r in d dimensions. You'll have  a volume of c_d r^d where c_d is a constant. Now, imagine an orange has some fixed fraction of its outer radius is rind, say the inner 9/10s is edible. Then for a d dimensional orange, the inner edible volume has volume c_d (0.9 r)^d, and the total volume is c_d r^d. Now, look at their ratio, this is 0.9^d, so as the dimension increases, more and more orange. is proportionally inedible. So never buy a high dimensional orange. One way of thinking about what is going on here is that if one is near the center of a sphere in high dimensions one has many options of what direction to go in if one wanders off, so there's a lot of places to reach moving away from the center that are still close by.",0,0

dpMFGr-wznc,Being Bisexual suck sometimes. I am a Bisexual Single mum... but apparently now that I have a kid ( who shockingly came from me sleeping with a man) means that I can no longer date women and that women no longer want to have even remote interest in me because having a child makes me straight and I am lying to them also got told that a kid isn't wanted by lesbians so I should just give up and stick to me and also that the idea and constant reminder  (in form of a child ) that I had sex with men is too much to ask a lesbian to over look......... Sooo yeah pretty Shitty.,0,0
dpMFGr-wznc,You exist and you matter. (but you knew that already.),0,0
dpMFGr-wznc,"Not bisexual, but pansexual and thank you. Not just for admitting that sometimes we all have an internalized fear of rejection from our partner, but for learning that it shouldn't affect a relationship. Too often we (not linear sexualities such as heterosexual or homorsexual) get looked at as trying too hard to please, or just being promiscuous. As much as we try to keep our heads up, sometimes it can get hard, especially when the ridicule is coming from those we hold most dear.",0,0

dpMFGr-wznc,I consider myself a bisexual even though I have never been with a woman and I am constant combat with myself.

I've had crushes (and even fell for) my female friends but is that something all girls do? Am I just imagining I had feelings for them? It really sucks sometimes. But videos like this help.

dpMFGr-wznc,"This video was awesome, Hannah. Thank you for doing this. My last girlfriend wasn't confident in her sexuality and I think that made me feel like I had to prove that what we had was real to others. It wasn't until I started dating my current girlfriend who is also bi that I realized that that wasn't all of it. When I was first telling my dad about my girlfriend, he started getting defensive about her sexuality because he was bitter that my ex wouldn't come out or be honest about our relationship (it's a long story, but his opinion was valid for reasons - I understood his concern). But when I was trying to reassure him and explain the difference between the two situations, I caught myself saying no, she's like ACTUALLY bisexual. And I still can't stress how much of a wake up call that was for me. I was unintentionally totally invalidating and belittling both of their experiences. Thankfully my dad is the kind of guy who was open when I brought that topic back up to correct myself. It's something that has become a big pet peeve of mine now, but I'm not sure that wanting people's experiences to be respected and validated is really a pet peeve.

dpMFGr-wznc,Well my name is Joshua I'm straight I dated a bisexual girl and accepted and loved her regardless. Yes I had fears but never wanted to set a label or pressure her. Recently we broke because she can't handle the way she feels about anything I want to help because I love her regardless and she means the world to me but  I can't.  She is very I undisisive  about  beliefs morals personality love and her sexuality. I wish I could help her in whatever way I can i want her to be happy in whatever way she pleases. I guess what I'm trying to say and hopefully get a answer is I don't see a label as anyone we are all diffren t and we shouldn't categorise somebody by race but  sexuality or even nationality but is it ok to to be with a person who can't decide and is very complicated  in the sense of holding on to someone u cherish a year with then leaves in a week because things change.,0,1

dpMFGr-wznc,"The GOSPEL\\nThe most important question you'll ever answer is how can sinners get in right standing with a Holy God?  Since Adam and Eve disobeyed God in Genesis all of humanity has been separated from fellowship with God the Father and have a debt that must be repaid.  The bible states that the wages of sin is death, and that without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.  Since man committed sin only man can atone for sin.  In Romans 3 the word of God also states, there is no one righteous, no not one, and that, all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. God requires a perfect sacrifice in order to forgive our sin. Are you or do you know anyone who is perfect?  Since none of us are righteous or perfect there is nothing we can do or offer God that can appease His just and righteous wrath. \\n \\nHow do you plan on repaying Him for your debt?  The word states that the Lord has appointed a day where He will judge the world in righteousness.  If your sin debt has not been forgiven then you will be found guilty when you stand before Him.  So what do you plan on doing?  The harsh reality is there is nothing you can do.  That is the bad news, but we praise God that He gave us an escape from His wrath through His son Jesus Christ.  The word states, For our sake He made Him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God. \\n \\nChrist suffered God's WRATH that we deserve, so that we could have His forgiving GRACE!  How did Jesus do it?  Jesus took on flesh, came to earth, lived the perfect life, was crucified, died, and rose again on the third day.  In perfect subjection to the Father, Jesus died for the sins of those who would trust that He died for their sins.  ​The bible demands that we repent and believe the Gospel.  What will you do? \\n \\nWill you repent, turn from your sin and trust Christ for His righteousness?  Or will you face the Judge with your own righteousness?

dpMFGr-wznc,Hey Hannah thanks for making these videos and thanks even more for being unapologetically yourself. Sexuality is a confusing thing and videos like this just help people realize that they aren't alone in their confusion. When I first started questioning my sexuality in 9th grade I thought I was bi. Now (5 years later) I claim queer as my label--I like it because it's super unspecific and vague which leaves me room to change. There are a lot of comments here that are making me a little sad but there are just as many (if not more) supporting you and the LGBTQIA+ community and that makes me smile.\nSo hey thanks for the video and thanks for being yourself. \n- A confused queer kid :),0,0

dpMFGr-wznc,"My boy and i are both technically Bi. Spectrum wise I'm heteroflexible and he's homoflexible. I know we both feel threatened by other men due to both of our leanings being toward men. However we dont let that rule us or the friendships that we make. We both have several male friends of various sexualities as well as female friends of various sexualities. It all comes down to open honesty between the two (or more) of you in the relationship. (Cause you know, triads are a thing)",0,0
dpMFGr-wznc,"i labeled myself as bisexual in middle school and i remember being one of the few to have a same sex partner and was out. I remember a couple people telling me that so no so think's you're weird but I want you to know i'm not judging, a few friends thought i wanted to date them (despite being taken at the time), I was grounded several times, and i got detention. But once i hit high school my then gf and i got little to no hate, it was surprising considering i do live in the south. \\nI can't speak for any experiences into my adult life, though, because i've since learned I'm actually asexual. Regardless my sexuality and when i did question it does, oddly, help when i do speak against any sort of -phobic person.",0,0

Am I really bi or am I just pretending I am to make myself feel more interesting? How can I know for sure if I've never been with a lady? I've had crushes (and even fell for) my female friends but is that something all girls do? Am I just imagining I had feelings for them? It really sucks sometimes. But videos like this help.

dpMFGr-wznc,"I am so happy to be seeing this today--great timing! I identify as femme, and I've been with my girlfriend for 5 years, and I am constantly defending my sexuality. It's only recently that I've been comfortable admitting that my sexuality is more fluid, and that I find men attractive, because I've spent so much time trying to prove my gayness to others.

dpMFGr-wznc,"As someone who is bisexual one thing that drives me crazy to hear is well if you like both just go for the opposite gender to fit the societal norms. It drives me crazy, that's not how I approach getting in a relationship with someone. My sister told me Unless you're going to be in a committed relationship with a girl you shouldn't tell [our traditional] parents. It came from a place of love, but just seemed like an issue the family shouldn't have to deal with unless I end up with a girl. I just went through a breakup with my girlfriend a couple weeks ago and ended up telling my mom. She was very understanding about it all, but one of the things she told me that kind of irked me was because I didn't have a lot of experience dating I still needed to go out there and figure out what I wanted. I hate that my sexuality, which I am sure of, is constantly being questioned which in turn makes me question and feel wrong about something I know is right.",0,0
dpMFGr-wznc,"i recently dated a bisexual and for the past few weeks of our relationship, she wanted to be in a relationship of the opposite gender so she ended the relationship. idk how to feel abt it that she actually thought of getting together with a guy WHILE we're in a relationship or is it normal to feel something hatred, insecurity, etc.?",0,0

Not just for admitting that sometimes we all have an internalized fear of rejection from our partner, but for learning that it shouldn't affect a relationship. Too often we (not linear sexualities such as heterosexual or homorsexual) get looked at as trying too hard to please, or just being promiscuous. As much as we try to keep our heads up, sometimes it can get hard, especially when the ridicule is coming from those we hold most dear.",0,0

dpMFGr-wznc,"This video was awesome, Hannah. Thank you for doing this. My last girlfriend wasn't confident in her sexuality and I think that made me feel like I had to prove that what we had was real to others. It wasn't until I started dating my current girlfriend who is also bi that I realized that that wasn't all of it. When I was first telling my dad about my girlfriend, he started getting defensive about her sexuality because he was bitter that my ex wouldn't come out or be honest about our relationship (it's a long story, but his opinion was valid for reasons - I understood his concern). But when I was trying to reassure him and explain the difference between the two situations, I caught myself saying no, she's like ACTUALLY bisexual. And I still can't stress how much of a wake up call that was for me. I was unintentionally totally invalidating and belittling both of their experiences. Thankfully my dad is the kind of guy who was open when I brought that topic back up to correct myself. It's something that has become a big pet peeve of mine now, but I'm not sure that wanting people's experiences to be respected and validated is really a pet peeve. Anyway, I'm rambling now but I just wanted to say thank you. 💙",0,0

Recently we broke because she can't handle the way she feels about anything I want to help because I love her regardless and she means the world to me but  I can't.  She is very I undisisive  about  beliefs morals personality love and her sexuality. I wish I could help her in whatever way I can i want her to be happy in whatever way she pleases. I guess what I'm trying to say and hopefully get a answer is I don't see a label as anyone we are all diffren t and we shouldn't categorise somebody by race but  sexuality or even nationality but is it ok to to be with a person who can't decide and is very complicated  in the sense of holding on to someone u cherish a year with then leaves in a week because things change.,0,1

dpMFGr-wznc,"As a bisexual female I would just like to point out that this video was amazing to watch. I've always felt super weird knowing that people question my sexuality in the sense that they think that it is less valid, and I happen to be dating a trans person, so people have now told me I am pan, but I identify as bi, so that's a thing. My point here is that the person that I am dating and I are both in interesting positions on the spectrum, and as Hannah said, I think everyone is. I personally think whatever term a person chooses to use for how they feel they fall on the spectrum is appropriate despite how another person may define the others sexuality. So thank you Hannah for this video it was really amazing to watch and I really needed it. There's so much hate in the world, and the more love there is the better🌈❤️",0,0

dpMFGr-wznc,Hey Hannah thanks for making these videos and thanks even more for being unapologetically yourself. Sexuality is a confusing thing and videos like this just help people realize that they aren't alone in their confusion. When I first started questioning my sexuality in 9th grade I thought I was bi. Now (5 years later) I claim queer as my label--I like it because it's super unspecific and vague which leaves me room to change. There are a lot of comments here that are making me a little sad but there are just as many (if not more) supporting you and the LGBTQIA+ community and that makes me smile.\nSo hey thanks for the video and thanks for being yourself. \n- A confused queer kid :),0,0

But once i hit high school my then gf and i got little to no hate, it was surprising considering i do live in the south. \\nI can't speak for any experiences into my adult life, though, because i've since learned I'm actually asexual.

dpMFGr-wznc,"As someone who is bisexual one thing that drives me crazy to hear is well if you like both just go for the opposite gender to fit the societal norms. It drives me crazy, that's not how I approach getting in a relationship with someone. My sister told me Unless you're going to be in a committed relationship with a girl you shouldn't tell [our traditional] parents. It came from a place of love, but just seemed like an issue the family shouldn't have to deal with unless I end up with a girl. I just went through a breakup with my girlfriend a couple weeks ago and ended up telling my mom. She was very understanding about it all, but one of the things she told me that kind of irked me was because I didn't have a lot of experience dating I still needed to go out there and figure out what I wanted. I hate that my sexuality, which I am sure of, is constantly being questioned which in turn makes me question and feel wrong about something I know is right.",0,0

dpMFGr-wznc,Well my name is Joshua I'm straight I dated a bisexual girl and accepted and loved her regardless. Yes I had fears but never wanted to set a label or pressure her. Recently we broke because she can't handle the way she feels about anything I want to help because I love her regardless and she means the world to me but  I can't.  She is very I undisisive  about  beliefs morals personality love and her sexuality. I wish I could help her in whatever way I can i want her to be happy in whatever way she pleases. I guess what I'm trying to say and hopefully get a answer is I don't see a label as anyone we are all diffren t and we shouldn't categorise somebody by race but  sexuality or even nationality but is it ok to to be with a person who can't decide and is very complicated  in the sense of holding on to someone u cherish a year with then leaves in a week because things change.,0,1

Also considering this guy is sponsored and is making money from the footage, it is considered commercial.   Then close proximity flying to commercial transport is illegal without prior authorisation and safety analysis, which would have deemed this as unsafe on many levels.   This guy is simply reckless in promoting his own skills in this way, and paints a bad picture to the whole UAV community who are trying very hard to promote safe and responsible flight.",0,1

vo391vKvD4s,"AHHHHHH! I am so happy for you! I have been looking for these items and they are finally in the market, a month before my wedding day in November! I've been thinking about what to do about my lashes because usual lashes are too heavy and overpowering for my eyes. I do like dramatic make up at times but drama for people with bigger facial features is NOT the same as drama for me, a small faced Vietnamese girl. I really like the Empower (as I see it to be my goal and passion in life) and Fearless (bc this is what I hope to be haha) pairs! I've also been looking for an eyelash curler bc most standard curlers hit the outer corners of my eyes and it hurts! It's so exciting to see you come up with these new items!\\n\\nIn terms of beauty products I'm looking for, I would love to have more face palettes that cater to medium- tan skin tone. When I buy face palettes, I hate that only one color works on my skin while others are way too light and ashy or too deep. The Chrissy Teigen x Becca palette did well with catering to my skin tone. Maybe it would be nice to create four different face palettes for four different depths of skin tones. Brushes that are well made and fit well on small lid spaces would be great  too. I have trouble figuring out what would be too big and which is too small. Having a collection of brushes that  I KNOW will all work for people with small lid space would be great! I also have trouble with one dark sun spot. Asians often struggle with this skin issue and I wonder if you could create a product that is high coverage enough and cancels out the color of a dark sun spot. Sometimes when I use stuff it just creates a dark shadow like look under my eye where the sun spot is (not so cute haha).   \\n\\nI will comment more if I can think of any products to help you expand your brand. Thank you for creating items that many of us were looking for! And thank you for this giveaway! Best of luck on your cosmetics brand, Chi Tina!",0,0

dpMFGr-wznc,Thank you Hannah! Thank you thank you thank you! I have been with my wife for 10 years now and I identify as bi. I've been told that makes me a lesbian by so many people and sometimes I almost agree but just can't bring myself to do it. I know who I am! Bisexuals are so marginalized especially in the lgbtq community it's ridiculous. I feel like nobody understands! Or I did anyways. So thank you for bringing attention to the subject. I love you. You are awesome.,0,0
dpMFGr-wznc,"It makes me sad because my girlfriend constantly gets biphobic comments from friends who think they're not being biphobic. Since being with her I've noticed the biphobia around me a lot more and that it really hasn't gone away, same with homophobia too.",0,0
dpMFGr-wznc,"I'd consider myself bisexbian. It's a word I made up because I feel like I'm sexually attracted to females. I love women and they turn me on. But as for men, I don't have the same attraction. For men, I become attracted to their personalities, common interests, how they dress, how they hold themselves, etc. They become sexy in that way. And the sexual attraction comes with time. Hard to explain really. I've been with women 5 years solely and now often date men because its hard finding a lesbian that's willing to trust ya to be monogamous. I've been with the same guy for 3 years now, and there's still insecurities on his end because of it. Oh and I feel like finding a girl that is open in her sexuality (being freaky in bed) seems impossible.",0,0
dpMFGr-wznc,THANK YOU. More people need to understand this message. I am bisexual and I recently argued with my lesbian friend because she has some prejudices against bi women and was saying that she would never date one because we are more likely to cheat than lesbians...like what the actual fuck. I wish more people were accepting of ALL sexualities. We are all part of the LGBT family and we should all treat each other with the same respect we would like from others. Thank you for this beautiful message and for spreading the love! ♡,0,0
dpMFGr-wznc,It's so refreshing to hear a gay woman speak up on this. As a bisexual 21 year old I've faced a lot of stigma. I get slut shamed for it all the time and get told I'm greedy and I should just make up my mind. And all the women I've dated have always hated the fact I'm bi and have been paranoid about it. Why do people automatically assume bisexuals are sluts?! It's infuriating!,0,0

My sexuality doesn't change based on the gender of the person I'm with.",0,0

dpMFGr-wznc,I’m bi and I struggled with my sexuality for about a year. Because it’s super confusing to figure out that your sexuality isn’t what you thought it was. But I’ve received no backlash or questions from anyone. Once I figured it out it was all great.,0,0
dpMFGr-wznc,"As a bisexual woman and my experience: I finally acknowledged to myself that I was in fact Bi while I was dating a man in college. I know that putting a label on everything is pretty tiring and often times exhausting trying to keep everything straight (pun intended), but labeling myself, figuring out another aspect of who I am, helped me. I had a friend in college who was in a relationship with a woman and told me to just choose. In all honesty that was hurtful. That's like telling a person to choose one type of sandwich for the rest of their lives and that's what they have to continuously eat. I've had people ask me what percentage am I or am I sure it's not a phase. I've been approached for a threesome (to each their own I don't kink shame) which is not my cup of tea. Each person is unique and feels different things. It is honestly great to hear the perspective of someone who willingly acknowledges that they thought a certain way and, as they matured, came to some sort of realization. I love me. And I am a single monogamous bisexual bipolar biped. ;P",0,0
dpMFGr-wznc,"My girlfriend, when asked to put a label on herself, uses the label Pansexual. This means she can find attraction in anyone regardless of gender, non-gender or label. Some people have asked me, Doesn't that makes every person you both walk by feel like a threat?. And the answer is no! I think about it like this: she could haven chosen to be with anyone in the whole wide world... and she chose to be with me. So i think that makes our relationship really special :)",0,0

dpMFGr-wznc,"As a bisexual female I would just like to point out that this video was amazing to watch. I've always felt super weird knowing that people question my sexuality in the sense that they think that it is less valid, and I happen to be dating a trans person, so people have now told me I am pan, but I identify as bi, so that's a thing. My point here is that the person that I am dating and I are both in interesting positions on the spectrum, and as Hannah said, I think everyone is. I personally think whatever term a person chooses to use for how they feel they fall on the spectrum is appropriate despite how another person may define the others sexuality. So thank you Hannah for this video it was really amazing to watch and I really needed it. There's so much hate in the world, and the more love there is the better🌈❤️",1,0

dpMFGr-wznc,Hey Hannah thanks for making these videos and thanks even more for being unapologetically yourself. Sexuality is a confusing thing and videos like this just help people realize that they aren't alone in their confusion. When I first started questioning my sexuality in 9th grade I thought I was bi. Now (5 years later) I claim queer as my label--I like it because it's super unspecific and vague which leaves me room to change. There are a lot of comments here that are making me a little sad but there are just as many (if not more) supporting you and the LGBTQIA+ community and that makes me smile.\nSo hey thanks for the video and thanks for being yourself. \n- A confused queer kid :),0,0

However we dont let that rule us or the friendships that we make. We both have several male friends of various sexualities as well as female friends of various sexualities.

But once i hit high school my then gf and i got little to no hate, it was surprising considering i do live in the south. \\nI can't speak for any experiences into my adult life, though, because i've since learned I'm actually asexual.

My sister told me Unless you're going to be in a committed relationship with a girl you shouldn't tell [our traditional] parents. It came from a place of love, but just seemed like an issue the family shouldn't have to deal with unless I end up with a girl. I just went through a breakup with my girlfriend a couple weeks ago and ended up telling my mom. She was very understanding about it all, but one of the things she told me that kind of irked me was because I didn't have a lot of experience dating I still needed to go out there and figure out what I wanted.

She is very I undisisive  about  beliefs morals personality love and her sexuality. I wish I could help her in whatever way I can i want her to be happy in whatever way she pleases. I guess what I'm trying to say and hopefully get a answer is I don't see a label as anyone we are all diffren t and we shouldn't categorise somebody by race but  sexuality or even nationality but is it ok to to be with a person who can't decide and is very complicated  in the sense of holding on to someone u cherish a year with then leaves in a week because things change.,0,1

Absolutely. Unfortunately, there are a lot of people (like SJWs) whose response to anything that makes them uncomfortable is: There ought to be a (new) law!

I have watched this more than once....it is as entertaining as any drone video could be  and really it is unique in that I don't remember seeing anything like this before and dude , the music truly enhanced it.....laid back and we did not have to endure acrobatics so much, all that flipping gets a bit monotonous but, a flight that was entertaining to say the least. my fave parts.....the stupid union worker slammin his window, if that had been me I would have been hanging out the window and grooving on it...he probably had his penis in his hand, the small dive back down into the bridge structure was sweet and the move under the moving train was well let's say, something all drone flyers would love to do.  you may want to pull the plug now cuz topping this ? maybe a sweet babe in a bikini layin on top of the train willing to submit to the buzz of the drone but, with that you may be accused of photo shopping....I suggest you keep the chick to yourself and make it a real special day.

Who, lying on their death bed would worry over their 30-year-old body, or their 50-year-old hair? You regret that you did not try things, that you were no loving elnough. Be a wonderer, a lover of life. Be kind to others. Help those you can.

1yYV9-KoSUM,"HAPPY PRIDE, LOVE NEEDS NO CURE, PSYCHIATRIST STILL COVERTLY TREATS LGBTQ PEOPLE LIKE THEY ARE SICK, DON'T FALL FOR THEIR LIES AND PSYCH MEDS THAT KEEP YOU FROM GETTING HARD. Gay Pride was born out of a need to celebrate our right to exist without persecution.\\n \\nHISTORY of how Christians and doctors made gay a mental illness then and now. Until the nineteenth century, same-sex sexual activity unnatural acts, were crimes against nature, called sodomy, or buggery. Sodomy, derived from the biblical tale of Sodom (Genesis 19:1-8). In Europe and America Christians condemn homosexual because of Bible Old Testament law that assigned the death penalty for a man who lies with a male as with a woman. It was against the law. In 1857 Doctor Tardieu said that homosexuals have a form of insanity. German physician Karl Westphal in 1869 published an article saying homosexuality should come under psychiatric care rather than legal prosecution.\\n \\nPsychiatrist made homosexuality a mental illness. Psychiatrist say they do not treat homosexuality as a mental disorder today but they do. Psychiatrist say they do not treat gays as homosexuals and they make up different names of things that really mean they are treating them as being mentally ill for being gay or LGBTQ. Being gay is still against the law in many places and law enforcement still arrest and convict gay people for being gay. Most people in America are Christians and a large number of them are still anti-gay Christians who are also psychiatrist and psychotherapist who still think LGBTQ people are mentally ill and treat them that way. Psychiatrist give psychotropic drugs to LGBTQ people to make them straight and kill their sex urges. Don’t be fooled LGBTQ people they are trying to trick you and harm you. Don’t trust them, doctors lie and make money off of your suffering. LOVE NEEDS NO CURE",0,0

I had already been diagnosed with GERD when I was 20 and was on Prilosec. Ended up going to see another gastroenterologist who did a endoscope. I had severe gastritis and five stomach ulcers. Doctor was shocked at the severity, stating usually elderly people had what I was suffering from. They tested it to see if it was the bacteria causing it but it came back negative. I also didn’t take pain killers because I constantly worried about stomach ulcers. My treatment was a stronger antacid, a huge bottle of pills to take 3 times a day for 6 months, and another type of antacid in liquid form to take if pain persisted.  Too this day I still get scared whenever I get a stomach ache. I’m always nervous I’ll have another bout.",0,2

V_U6czbDHLE,"Tbh it is the HCl that damages the mucosa of the stomach, leading to the ulcer. H pylori just messes with the stomach's pH detection so gastric juice secretions aren't turned off. That's why you prescribe triple therapy: two antibiotics and a proton pump inhibitor to inhibit gastric juice secretion.\\n\\nAlso, H pylori is a common cause of *duodenal* ulcers (firstmost section of the small intestine). Gastric ulcers are less likely to be caused by H pylori alone; it is usually a combination of H pylori infection AND overuse of a class of painkiller called non-steroidal antiflammatories, such as aspirin and ibuprofen. With gastric ulcers, the infection needs to be all over the stomach but for duodenal ulcers only in the bottom-most region, closest to the duodenum (called the pylorus). The stomach-wide infection combined with inflammation (exacerbated by NSAID overuse, which inhibits prostaglandin as mentioned as a protective mechanism in the video) leads to gastric ulcers. Interestingly, if you have a duodenal ulcer, you are protected from gastric cancer, but more likely to get oesophageal cancer after treatment. Gastric ulcers can lead to gastric cancer and need to be closely monitored.",1,0

lSsTCiC93WI,"awesome review critic. I have an idea for what to review next. By next year there is going to be a Teen Titans GO! movie. As we all know, it's gonna suck to quote you Fantastic Four review. Since Teen Titans was originally DC, can you do something to discuss this on your channel? please? old-ish vs new-ish like that haunted review with Catherine Zita Jones? an editorial maybe?",0,0

lSsTCiC93WI,"I will always and forever believe none of those early Ryan Reynolds movies were his fault. I don't think most actors get the kind of pull to decide and tell a director to not sew someone's mouth shut, or make a suit CGI or the villain of a movie a  cloud. I actually thought RR made a half-ways decent Hal Jordan. Blade Trinity definitely was not Reynold's fault. And you never make the bad guy of a movie a fucking cloud like GL did. So like I said, none of these movies, IMO, was his fault",0,0

V_U6czbDHLE,The link between stress and stomach ulcer/acid reflux could be because of reduced Melatonin. There are a number of recent studies showing lowered Melatonin in patients with stomach ulcer and acid reflux. Melatonin has regenerative and protective qualities in Gastrointestinal mucosa in addition to regulating sleep patterns.

I have been suffering from IBS-C for last 10 years and at every point of my life it reminds me that I am badly sick. Stress is definitely one of the causes of developing these problems and the issue is that when you have IBS it brings stress with it even if you're doing well in your life it keeps you stressed hence it aggravates the symptoms and this cycle continues. IBS causes stress and stress causes IBS. The worse thing is that there is no cure for IBS in the medical world in 21st century.,0,0

I have been suffering from IBS-C for last 10 years and at every point of my life it reminds me that I am badly sick.

IBS causes stress and stress causes IBS. The worse thing is that there is no cure for IBS in the medical world in 21st century.,0,0

lSsTCiC93WI,"i  know you dont do tv series, but if you do, please sin ghost whisperer. and just to make it easier i have listed 5 things i hate about the series.\\n \\n1- the main character (melinda). the biggest cry baby, for a tough character she sure cries alot. i swear if i had a dollar for every episodes she cried i'd be a millionaire by now. i mean she meets dead people all the time she should get used to it by now. she is always the center of attention, her ghosts are more important than anyone else, yes that bothers me to no end. and call me a feminist or whatever, but having her showing her cleavage in EVERY.SINGLE.EPISODE. can get very distracting, very annoying very fast. i mean if that's what it takes to get ratings then that is just pathetic. i swear most of the time she goes to work in her night gown i can see her cleavage. what also annoys me is that she keeps talking in that whispering-about to faint voice. speaking of fainting, she does that alot, just asking for more attention.\\n\\n2-  (jim) the husband. i feel like the show made up a fantasy fictional husband that just wont work in real life. that's jim. he cooks, he cleans and melinda on the other hand wakes up at 3 am night to go search for her ghosts in the streets while leaving her husband to worry. she does that like more than once. there is an episode where she gets stuck inside a cave and jim has to look for her and when he finds her she bursts out crying like a fucking baby that she is and he just calms her down. now if that was in real life he'd be yelling at her not to run off in the middle of the night like a lunatic. or he could just divorce her on the spot. he told her many times that these ghost business should wait because he wants to spend more time with her but she is like nope, the ghosts are no.1. accept me for who i am. fucking selfish hoebag. i never saw this woman do any wife duties. i never saw her cook or clean, its always the husband. and before anyone jumps in again and says i am sexist, jim works in the paramedic and was a firefighter before. he runs around saving people. both his jobs puts huge muscle strain on him. yet we see him at home cooking like he wasnt even tired at all. in real life husbands would just remove their shoes and fall on the couch sleeping. all melinda does is stand in one spot selling or running off leaving the work to someone else while she chases her ghosts or drinks coffee. there are many times he rings her to see if she is ok and she is like sorry jim then hangs up. one time her husband told her off becasue it got too dangerous but she yelled at him saying stuff like don't tell me what to do i've got to save those ghosts!. and when he wanted to become a doctor and study outside of grandview (he was also trying to get her to stay away from danger), but she snapped at him saying what about me and my life and my store. she is fucking selfish. she is a bad wife. period.\\n\\n3- all fathers are bad, all mothers are saints. there are many times were some ghost fathers who did wrong but they arent bad themselves, but melinda treats them like criminals because she keeps seeing her father in them. for a gift like that she sure knows how to abuse it and the ghosts. there is even one episode in christmas, where the a father was talking to his ex-wife about her affair with another man and the son might not be his, the wife snapped at him saying i cant believe you'd actually do a paternity test!. well, it's HIS FUCKING RIGHT TO KNOW IF HIS SON IS HIS OR NOT. fucking whore. and i swear to god, i knew i saw it coming, he receives the test results by mail and melinda ACTUALLY convinces him to accept his child even if it's not his because it christmas the season of forgiving. and he tears the letter! i literally screamed at the tv and hit my fist so hard it hurt. in what justice do you treat your husband like that? the wife goes fucking around and then carries a bastard that has a huge risk its not the father and the father has to forgive the wife??!! NO FUCK THAT YOU FUCKING WHORE. FUCK YOU MELINDA. and also the episode where the college teacher payne knew his ghost wife was cheating with someone else and melinda AGAIN asks him to forgive his wife just so she could go to the light but he refuses (having every right to do so) but the ghost just backfires at him. \\n\\n4- everyone in grandview is rude. i dont know why they do that. is it to scare me not to visit grandview or just to make melinda look more like an angel? but i have seen this more than once. every one she meets and their first words to her are who are you? what do you want? excuse me? they all look at her antagonizingly. there is even one episode where she wants to sells some stuff and the receptionist looks at her from bottom to top with the biggest attitude i've ever seen. and its not like she meets her again, no, this is like a one time encounter in the whole freakin series. it makes no sense and it makes me NOT want to live in grandview.\\n\\n5- there is no judgment, everyone goes to the light. yes including killers, rapists, wrongdoers, whores, liars, thieves, criminals, kidnappers, Sociopaths etc.\\n\\ni'd rather watch supernatural than this crap",0,0

V_U6czbDHLE,The link between stress and stomach ulcer/acid reflux could be because of reduced Melatonin. There are a number of recent studies showing lowered Melatonin in patients with stomach ulcer and acid reflux.

That could also explain lack of sleep accompanied by these symptoms when stress levels are high. A clear mind allows the body to heal.,1,0

I have been suffering from IBS-C for last 10 years and at every point of my life it reminds me that I am badly sick. Stress is definitely one of the causes of developing these problems and the issue is that when you have IBS it brings stress with it even if you're doing well in your life it keeps you stressed hence it aggravates the symptoms and this cycle continues. IBS causes stress and stress causes IBS. The worse thing is that there is no cure for IBS in the medical world in 21st century.,0,0

lSsTCiC93WI,"i  know you dont do tv series, but if you do, please sin ghost whisperer. and just to make it easier i have listed 5 things i hate about the series.\\n \\n1- the main character (melinda). the biggest cry baby, for a tough character she sure cries alot. i swear if i had a dollar for every episodes she cried i'd be a millionaire by now. i mean she meets dead people all the time she should get used to it by now. she is always the center of attention, her ghosts are more important than anyone else, yes that bothers me to no end. and call me a feminist or whatever, but having her showing her cleavage in EVERY.SINGLE.EPISODE. can get very distracting, very annoying very fast. i mean if that's what it takes to get ratings then that is just pathetic. i swear most of the time she goes to work in her night gown i can see her cleavage. what also annoys me is that she keeps talking in that whispering-about to faint voice. speaking of fainting, she does that alot, just asking for more attention.\\n\\n2-  (jim) the husband. i feel like the show made up a fantasy fictional husband that just wont work in real life. that's jim. he cooks, he cleans and melinda on the other hand wakes up at 3 am night to go search for her ghosts in the streets while leaving her husband to worry. she does that like more than once. there is an episode where she gets stuck inside a cave and jim has to look for her and when he finds her she bursts out crying like a fucking baby that she is and he just calms her down. now if that was in real life he'd be yelling at her not to run off in the middle of the night like a lunatic. or he could just divorce her on the spot. he told her many times that these ghost business should wait because he wants to spend more time with her but she is like nope, the ghosts are no.1. accept me for who i am. fucking selfish hoebag. i never saw this woman do any wife duties. i never saw her cook or clean, its always the husband. and before anyone jumps in again and says i am sexist, jim works in the paramedic and was a firefighter before. he runs around saving people. both his jobs puts huge muscle strain on him. yet we see him at home cooking like he wasnt even tired at all. in real life husbands would just remove their shoes and fall on the couch sleeping. all melinda does is stand in one spot selling or running off leaving the work to someone else while she chases her ghosts or drinks coffee. there are many times he rings her to see if she is ok and she is like sorry jim then hangs up. one time her husband told her off becasue it got too dangerous but she yelled at him saying stuff like don't tell me what to do i've got to save those ghosts!. and when he wanted to become a doctor and study outside of grandview (he was also trying to get her to stay away from danger), but she snapped at him saying what about me and my life and my store. she is fucking selfish. she is a bad wife. period.\\n\\n3- all fathers are bad, all mothers are saints. there are many times were some ghost fathers who did wrong but they arent bad themselves, but melinda treats them like criminals because she keeps seeing her father in them. for a gift like that she sure knows how to abuse it and the ghosts. there is even one episode in christmas, where the a father was talking to his ex-wife about her affair with another man and the son might not be his, the wife snapped at him saying i cant believe you'd actually do a paternity test!. well, it's HIS FUCKING RIGHT TO KNOW IF HIS SON IS HIS OR NOT. fucking whore. and i swear to god, i knew i saw it coming, he receives the test results by mail and melinda ACTUALLY convinces him to accept his child even if it's not his because it christmas the season of forgiving. and he tears the letter! i literally screamed at the tv and hit my fist so hard it hurt. in what justice do you treat your husband like that? the wife goes fucking around and then carries a bastard that has a huge risk its not the father and the father has to forgive the wife??!! NO FUCK THAT YOU FUCKING WHORE. FUCK YOU MELINDA. and also the episode where the college teacher payne knew his ghost wife was cheating with someone else and melinda AGAIN asks him to forgive his wife just so she could go to the light but he refuses (having every right to do so) but the ghost just backfires at him. \\n\\n4- everyone in grandview is rude. i dont know why they do that. is it to scare me not to visit grandview or just to make melinda look more like an angel? but i have seen this more than once. every one she meets and their first words to her are who are you? what do you want? excuse me? they all look at her antagonizingly. there is even one episode where she wants to sells some stuff and the receptionist looks at her from bottom to top with the biggest attitude i've ever seen. and its not like she meets her again, no, this is like a one time encounter in the whole freakin series. it makes no sense and it makes me NOT want to live in grandview.\\n\\n5- there is no judgment, everyone goes to the light. yes including killers, rapists, wrongdoers, whores, liars, thieves, criminals, kidnappers, Sociopaths etc.\\n\\ni'd rather watch supernatural than this crap",0,0
lSsTCiC93WI,"20:19 - 21:06\\n\\nYou know what's even worse about Parallax's effects, is that THE F***ING TOY THAT PROMOTED THE MOVIE based on him looks more realistic!\\n\\nNo seriously, he's was creepy, he looked more true to the comics while still looking new, AND like the comics he looked like a living radioactive explosion!\\nhttps://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71oyPBOYj8L._SL1300_.jpg\\n\\nIt's pretty bad when you realize the toy company could've made a more accurate Green Lantern movie than this.",0,0

lSsTCiC93WI,"Unpopular opinion; Green Lantern's special effects don't actually look that bad, I actually liked the colour work of the film and a lot of the shot composition, I thought Reynolds was halfway entertaining to watch despite the uninspired plot and Mark Strong was a pretty great Sinestro. People act like this movie was Catwoman or Elektra or any Batman movie before the Nolan Trilogy but it's problem isn't that the CG was bad (it really, really isn't), it's just that it's a 6/10 movie. I mean, Green Lantern was at least more memorable than Thor 2, every Hulk movie, any superhero film with a female lead before Wonder Woman (I've heard Tank Girl is good but I haven't watched it myself). Honestly Critic's over the top hate for the film annoyed me more than anything else, since he usually comes off as the voice of reason in the sea of cynical shit that is the internet.",0,0

lSsTCiC93WI,I remember being so hyped for this movie but in the end it was a turd. I remember this came out two weeks after X-Men: First Class. I wasn't especially excited for that movie because the last X-Men prequel was also a turd though First Class was directed by the same bloke who made Kick-Ass so I was a little hopeful and it turned out to be really good and the best superhero flick of 2011 along with Thor and Captain America: The First Avenger.,0,0

8hP6WROycAU,"Whenever I had felt depressed, lonely, neglected, sad, hopeless, guilty, I used to lie over my bed and then I started playing Chester's song and within the touch of his voice, I used to feel hopeful and happy. His songs had not only showed me how to break habits, how to resist myself from drug abuse or drinking alcohol, But His songs showed me the way of light. How to overcome, How to achieve anything, How to feel happy.\\n\\nYeh. I could not make friends at my school or coachings. Every one used to make fun of me. Within these 10 years I had lost many of my beloved people. 3 years ago, I lost my beloved cousin whom I used to recall as my sister. 4 Years ago, I lost Both of my Grandfathers. Not to mention, My favorite TV celebrities. But Chester's voice and his tremendous meaningful lyrics used to act like magical remedies for those scarces. \\nI will never know myself until I do this on my own\\nAnd I will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed\\nI will never be anything 'til I break away from me\\nI will break away, I'll find myself today\\n\\nThis song used to fill the gap of my loneliness and whenever I used listen to this song, I would find my cheek wet. Chester was like a member of my family. I had a plan to meet him one day. But that day had converted to a fairy tale. I lost him forever. Perhaps, From Outside everyone is thinking that I am happy and ok. But from inside, I am virtually empty now. Perhaps, No one will be able occupy his place, No one will be able to make comparision between themselves and Him. And while writting this post, I was crying like that 7 years old Saiful. 😭💔Why Chester Why? You could live for us. Millions of people like me loves you. \\nYour life was priceless to us. \\nYou gave me the light\\nYou touched my life, \\nYour legacy will be immortalized.\\nRip Chester. \\nSee You Again.",0,0

f3uF3EpSZMw,"Hey Martina. I found your channel like 3-4 yrs ago? And i admired your overpoweringly infectious positive attitude and wished i had just 5% of that energy and high spirits. I havnt been seeing your channel for maybe the past yr or more (before it was religiously) and as i came to see the couple episodes in the past yrs, this one struck me to write. As u know the difference of building ur ladder, im proud of u yet not suprised. Uve always been so strong minded, not letting urself powerless. So heres my advice, when you lay down, feeling like u need the rest or not feeling good, read self-help books and i highly recommend Presence by Amy Cuddy (can find on Amazon). It explains how to feel more powerful in a psychological viewpoint of rather simple ways with great results. Even explains how u can acheive it when you lay paralyzed. Its small nudges that will fortify in time. Im not a big book reader, but this book kept me engaged the whole time and i can see how it can help u when applied. Too detailed for me to explain shortly. Ill prah for you right now, Dear God, we thank you always for the many blessings u have given to Martina. I know your purpose is greater and will not be meaningless. I know ur making it very hard, but we know her reward is far greater than she knows. Not just for her benefit directly, but how it is affecting others positively. Which is what makes Martina happy too. Of course she would rather rid the pain for good, but one thing i can say is i thank u God for showing so many people Martinas strength and heart through the breakdown she goes through. U picked the strongest candidate to help more lives who couldnt do it. And i know u will give Martina more strength, wisdom, and influence to others, with a golden house for her in heaven. Amen.",0,0

f3uF3EpSZMw,"From my very own Experience the only thing I can tell you is  that when you can't withstand against illness or pain or any hardship in this life, if you seek God with all your heart and despair believing even if you never believed before, he responds with real facts, not very much people can believe in this. but I can tell you, that when I lost everything, ( my job, my Family, my house, and all my dignity as human being  ) and I was totally abandoned with big health problems ( chronic heart arrhythmia and insomnia) I prayed to god and regret myself of all my old ways and ask him for Help and rescue, he answered me, 4 years ago, God gave me a new life with a wonderful wife and new family,  healed my body,  also he put me in the best job I ever had in my whole life and now I don't even remember those freakin' bad days where I suffered so much! And I'm still todat thanking him for all this wonderful new life through this message.  Martina, Simon, I've been seeking your videos since 2013 you're a wonderful couple and I wish you the best life you can get. Martina I will also pray to God for your health. but this is all I can tell you as an advice if you knock his door he will open it and he will heal you, just some faith can change all!  A big hug from Chile Thanks for entertaining me so much!!",0,0

f3uF3EpSZMw,"I can't relate to anything you've been through, but I've had some knee pain going on for a little over year. It's started last year after I banged it really hard on some rocks when I went caving and white water rafting; caving was on a Tuesday and rafting was on a Thursday. I went to the doctor and she thought I tore my meniscus. Went to sleep away camp, and messed it up by climbing a really steep hill like 5 times that week. Went again and she thought I had a bruise underneath my kneecap. \\n\\nFast forward a few months, I started to play soccer and running on an already messed up knee doesn't mix. \\n\\nFast forward to July of this year, I started to notice my knee hurting, but it wasn't too bad. Just like a small muscle spasm here and there. 2 weeks later, I notice on how bad my knee started to hurt. I was at sleep away camp for that week, mid July, and the following week so I couldn't really do much. At this camp, we walk everywhere and it's in the mountains of VA. The camp has a few golf carts to transport things for point a to point b and some people if they're hurt for some context. \\n\\nBy the end of the first week of the two weeks at camp (last week in July to first week in August), I was in so much pain. I had the knee pain and for some odd reason, I have this weird rib pain where it feels like someone is stabbing me in the ribs. The following week, I went rock climbing and that was a big mistake. I went all day, until about half past 2 pm and I went to a camp site. Later that night, I twisted my right ankle and I think it's still messed up to this day… \\n\\nFast forward to last night where I was in so much knee pain. I was so close to becoming insane from the pain in my knee, but my best friend kept my composure and made sure I didn't go insane. She did the same thing tonight and fun fact, we call each other love cause we both love each other so much. (Yes we're friends, no we aren't dating) \\n\\nI totally agree with what you said Martina about pain altering your mind. I was so f**king miserable last night and tonight from my knee killing me. Anyway, my rant about my annoying life is done. \\n\\n(Shameless self promo, if you love inspirational quotes, follow me on Instagram! @natalie_b_photography\\nI post around every day, usually with a quote)",0,0

Thank you for making videos like this being so open about your struggles, it brings attention to something so important.  \\n I was able to get an ESA that has greatly helped my depression caused by not being able to do things most people my age can.

f3uF3EpSZMw,"This also makes me think about how what Martina is suffering limits how many types of jobs she can do. I honestly feel that today's working environments aren't very accommodating for people's individual physiques and physical limitations. I imagine that having a good job is a great and very welcome distraction for this sort of pain. Just keeping busy with something productive can be great.\\n\\nOn the the plus side, if it wasn't for this and Martina did have more work options then Martina may not have been quite as compelled to become this youtube superstar in the most awesome youtube superstar couple of today. And that's saying a lot because there's a lot of amazing youtube couples out there.\\n\\nWeather is something else to take into consideration for a person's mental well-being. My neighbour drives trains for the ttc and he said that the deeper in winter it gets the more people who will commit suicide. In the dead of winter when nobody would dare go outside I force myself to put on many many layers and get out of the house because cabin fever sucks and I know it will cheer me up. A lady once thought I was homeless and refused to believe that I'm not homeless because I was out for a walk in the middle of winter.\\n\\nSo yeah, what I do is just get out of the house, even when the weather doesn't want me to. My wife used to think I'm nuts for going out smack in the middle of winter, but then she'd thank me for forcing her to get out of the house with me. Going to places that have more of an outdoors and social lifestyle. Finding ways to do the sort of work I really enjoy doing as a way to make a living. I've met so many people in my life who are unhappy just because of their work.\\n\\nSharing your bad days isn't what's important. What's important is you sharing how you deal with bad days.",0,0
f3uF3EpSZMw,"My ladder has been a very difficult process. I also have EDS, along several other disabilities. On top of this, I have severe depression, GAD, OCD, and PTSD. The worst of all of that, comes from rape PTSD. It's taken moving out of the area that my abuser lives in, burning the bed in happened in, among other things, to feel like I can get out of bed in the morning, without panicking all day that he'll come for me(justice system did nothing about what happened). Now I'm having to go back to that area, to finalize the move stuff(pack what's left, hire movers), and my anxiety and panic feel like they've never been higher. I'm on my way down there as I type this, and I am horrified. The logic and panic sides of my brain are odds with each other, and I'm having a very hard time finding those first rungs. I'm trying, I'm doing my best. But all the panic, anxiety, stress; It's all making my physical stuff way worse, and I can't sleep well because of nightmares. I wake up sick and in severe pain, and I go to bed, sick, and in severe pain. So I am focusing on making the those rungs, be the ladder that gets me back home, and far away from him.",0,0

5IP8jQNXDOo,"Prayers for all affected.\\n\\nThe Lord Jesus Christ is coming, friends. \\n\\nThere is so much pain in this world, and things are going to get a lot worse. \\n\\nJesus died so that we may live. \\n\\nIn this world, even as a Christian, we are going to suffer pain and tribulation, BUT Jesus promised us that we will dwell with Him someday in a new place, a new heaven and a new earth. There will be no more pain or suffering. In fact, God Himself will wipe all tears from our eyes. \\n\\nSo please, if you don't know Jesus, call upon Him today. Repent of your sins and put your faith in Jesus Christ. He loves you, my friends. He is not angry at you, although the devil will have you to believe that He is. This is not true, because Jesus is waiting on you to call upon Him in Truth. \\n\\nHe is not a God who forces Himself on you, He is a God that respects your decision, but He has shown us that each decision we make has consequences. \\n\\nSo make the greatest decision of your life and make Jesus your Lord and Savior. You will be forgiven, you will be delivered, you will be set free. \\n\\nTrust in His Love. \\n\\nI pray you consider calling out to Jesus, because to die without The Lord is a very dangerous thing - there is a major consequence to it. \\n\\nShalom, friends.",0,0

Not everything needs to be an advertisement (watch this because..., we're so funny I have a unique personality) In addition, they talked about a terrible event and communities in turmoil without getting political and framing statements to sway the audience. Just a group of people mourning and communicating just because they still can. I hope all of you have a wonderful and safe day!

8hP6WROycAU,"It's so hard to believe that in one moment it could all end. I grew up with 5 older siblings, all whom were teens during the early 2000's-2010. During this time is when rock music was at its height and everyone knew Linkin Park, Green Day and more. I grew up listening to these bands and songs and honestly, I thank my siblings for that. I always joke around and say that I was destined to be emo because at the age of 8 I knew all the lyrics to Green Day's Boulevard of Broken Dreams, and honestly I'm proud of that. Now, I'm 13 and all my siblings are now adults and I thank them so much for non-stop playing 2000's songs in the car and at home when I was younger and introducing me to some of the greatest music there is out there. Now, I listen to the same bands my siblings did when they where my age and more (MCR, P!ATD, FOB), although I can say they never dug as deep as I did and didn't become obsessed with bands like My Chemical Romance. Being the youngest of 6 of course I was destined to be the odd one and be full on emo as you might say. Of course they think I'm odd for listening to music that's older than me by several years, or to music that screams a lot, but honestly I'm proud of it. In the car when one of these old song comes on I know it and my siblings and I jam out to it together. So once again thanks to my older siblings for showing me the good music.",0,0

pRnbzkMsgmM,A bump stock is not necessary to make a semi-automatic AR-15 or AK-47 fire as a full automatic.  By pushing forward on the handguard while holding the rifle loosely and keeping your finger on the trigger without using the grip when the rifle recoils while being pushed forward it will bump the trigger finger repeatedly and keep firing.

When I have another day when my mind is trying to prevent me from leaving my bed, I think I will watch this video again.\\nAlso, you've inspired me to leave my house for the first time today, to go to the gym no less!!",0,0

f3uF3EpSZMw,"I have dysautonomia. On most days I'm perfectly fine like any average person but with an extreme heat sensitivity. On days when its bad I have chronic pain, dizziness, bouts of fainting and collapsing, my knees give out, I have a constant fog on my mind making it hard to work, and it aggrivates my depression and anxiety. It makes it hard to get out of bed because I fear fainting, but what kills me most is that it is so hard to do basic tasks and makes me feel useless. This video made me feel warm inside. I recently was in a hospital because I collapsed on bricks and had to be given fluids to build up my blood volume. You inspire me. Thank you so much",0,0

My gynecologist after surgery had the nerve to say to me So it wasn't in your head after all.   I can understand your pain when trying to get out of bed in the morning though.

f3uF3EpSZMw,I hope this doesn't offend you guys but have you tried marijuana to help with the pain? I know the leaves and flowers are illegal in japan but cbd should be allowed.

f3uF3EpSZMw,Sorry for your pain .. hope it will get better soon .. you're so strong.. I had an accident in the gym 2 years ago and hurt my knee since then I stopped going there and gain 10 kgs and just lost hope as every time I pull myself to the gym my knee hurts and burning even the physio therapy I stopped it after 2 months as it hurts and nothing changed .. I'm well aware that I will lose myself this way but it's so hard to go to the doctor and do the therapy again with all that pain and sleepless nights it needs a lot of strength.. I'm trying to get back and start the treatment again but I'm still in tye avoiding phase,0,0

f3uF3EpSZMw,"I just wanted to let you guys know that your videos helped me get through a hella tough time in my life. My father was suddenly diagnosed with brain cancer over 5 years ago now, and after a truly terrible 14 months of him transforming into a person that I did not nor cared to know, and suffering from something that took away his ability to live life, he passed away and I was momentarily relieved. Then 6 months later I became so depressed that I rarely went to school and my GPA dropped from a 3.9 to 2.8 by the end of the year. If it had not been for your videos and the people I still had around me, I honestly don't think I would still be here. I had some scary thoughts that to this day occasionally come back to haunt me as I have struggled to transition into adulthood and face my issues head-on. When I get depressed, I watch your videos and you guys never fail to make me laugh. I can't tell you how thankful I am to be able to watch the content you produce despite the issues you have had to face in your own lives. Thank you so, so much guys.

I have chronic full body pain, which might be vitamin deficiencies but might be something more serious that we need to address next, no one is sure yet. There are so many days when making it to the couch is the great accomplishment of my day. \\n\\nThis is the first time I've seen the idea of building a ladder laid out like this. Sure, psychologists have talked about small steps, but it never seemed useful. What good is making it out of the house when all I'm doing it hurting? By showing this, you've inspired me to take those steps. It means more coming from someone who knows the pit personally, you know?

f3uF3EpSZMw,"Thank you so much for sharing this. Really, I'm in tears. Not necessarily because I'm sad, I think I'm feeling good?\\nI struggle too (most people do in some way or another right?) with chronic pain, mental health and more. Today, even tho I'm not in much pain as the meds are working, is a relax day. I was out a lot yesterday, I had a very productive day. Today my only chore was doing the laundry, and it was tiring enough. Tomorrow I'm going out again to exercise my knee because it's bad, also I'll be getting groceries. Friday, dentist. Weekend? Relaxing. I can't do a lot within a short time and I need a lot of breaks. Because of this I tend to be jealous of other that seem to have it much better (I know that may not be the truth, but it feels like that) and end up in a dark place and not getting out of bed until 4pm. I did not know of this #buildalatter but I'm very glad I found it and this video. I will remember what you said and tomorrow when I go out, after exercising I'm walking to a cafe with a smile on my face, get myself a latte and enjoy myself. That's the plan I hope to achieve. It's tough but I will get through it. Small steps for some, big steps for one. Thank you again for sharing this, it means a lot to me.

f3uF3EpSZMw,"My little things, besides of course relaxing & reading/tv/phone are: writing - journals, research, etc.\\nMy love for Ghibli movies has allowed me to walk around with an imagination and appreciation for taking in my surroundings.\\nTalking about ideas, supernatural, God, life- the extra-ordinary.\\nMusic such as Foster the People, Phoenix, Kendrick Lamar, and many more.\\nThe atmosphere- candles & scents, and if I can get myself to clean really good, enjoying that.\\nSitting outside with my doggy and some coffee.\\nPlaying guitar.\\nI hope to actually enjoy art again someday or work on story ideas, I am just so critical of myself!! But I wont force myself to do something for fun if it isn't!\\nIf I have money- movies, bakery, eating out, zoo, Shop Kawaii, Pet stores, conventions of any sort, road trip.\\nDoing small things to care for other people or animals (like feeding the fish we breed an extra meal or bringing snakes new water, or going out to pick up some litter!)\\n\\nIt means a lot getting your advice because of what you overcome. I don't have physical pain anywhere close to what you or others must deal with, so I am glad you did this video to give me more insight into others who do. Mental and emotional pain can definitely contribute to a) lack of exercise b) lack of self care & c) stress causes physical issues of course. So to see you using the ladder concept to overcome such an obstacle actually makes me believe that the small things WILL help everything! ♡ Also Simon reminds me to appreciate my husband, he is a very patient person where I know many people would lash out at me for my mental and emotional struggles. I try to be there for other people when they are down too. Everyone has their own story and with our own personalities, we all cope differently but should all be taken seriously.\\nI will never just 100% give up, I am here for the ride of life so I may as well stay hopeful and be kind to others even if some dont think kindly of me.",0,0

f3uF3EpSZMw,"Sorry to hear you have chronic pain - know the feeling. I have trigeminal neuralgia (also called the suicide disease - no cure & treatments for pain are hit or miss. Called so bc its one of the worst pain conditions known & the suicide rates for those with it historically have been over 20%). A popular story among communities is the spoon theory bc a woman described chronic pain to a friend as having a certain amount of spoons in a day & spending them on everyday tasks. Some days better than others, but once youre out of spoons you dont get them back & have to choose what you use them on wisely. It communicates how drastically chronic pain can kinda take over your life & influence every decision you make (ie: bad day & already used half the spoons just getting up & ready for the day = its not going to be a very productive day & you have to accept that limitation). Similar to building a ladder i guess. Do what you can & make peace with what you cant on any given day. A lot of people without chronic pain dont understand it, though, so i think bringing awareness to the experience of it - not just the clinical understanding of the words - is important.

It can be very challenging and I often find myself getting lost in dark places within myself with no place to go and voices that sometimes do not stop with their negative inputs and with family that spew negative words of it as well and such. I have found that the things you are saying to help with these and actually and seriously are true. Your videos help get me through so many things and there's no need to hide or be ashamed of the less positive side of you. Not at all. It shows that you are human, much like the rest of us and those emotions are something you feel comfortable sharing with your internet followers and family.  I envy you so much for taking what you're feeling and trying your best to overcome it. I really appreciate that you uploaded this video to express to us how much you actually trust us to expose yourself in your worst times and to let us know that you trust us to understand.

f3uF3EpSZMw,I am going through a lot of stuff right now with my own chronic diseases and seeing this video has really made it less lonely. I think at times chronic diseases can feel very isolating but the advice to build a ladder and get out to live life to connect with other things as best you can is such good advice. I think there is pressure to either stay home and act like a sick person or pretend it isn't happening and force yourself to do everything you normally would even if it is too much. For the most part the issues many of us deal with are not visible so they are hard to understand when we can't function at the level we are expected to. I had to reconcile that with myself that they way I live is going to be different and I can't get mad at myself for not being able to do things like a normal person because sometimes getting out of bed or the house is what you can do. I still struggle with the fact that I can't always do everything I expect of myself and that I should celebrate what I did get done. Sometimes the small feats are the biggest ones. \n\nSending good health vibes to everyone out there!,0,0

Yet white people have  decided to attack  a black man Cam Newton over complete and other nonsense. So white Americans care  more about a fucking whore getting her feelings hurt 😭. Then the victims of a   white terrorist murderer who committed one of the worst terrorist acts in the history of America. My dad told me those white devils was going to change the subject about what happened in Las Vegas. And instead attack any black man they could get their hands on . Cam Newton was a easy  target because he defeated Tom Brady in New England which pissed that  racist white trash off.,1,0

I don't own a gun and am not particularly invested in the second amendment but I don't want Congress to waist time on worthless feel good legislation that will have zero impact when there are laws that can be passed that will make a real diffrence. \\n\\nFor starters can we get off the background check band wagon. Every mass shooter in the past two decades would have passed a background check easily. Such a law would have zero impact on mass shootings. You know what we should do instead?

lCZCWjzQUM8,"There are 30,000 gun related deaths per year by firearms, and this number is not disputed. U.S. population 324,059,091 as of Wednesday, June 22, 2016. Do the math: 0.000000925% of the population dies from gun related actions each year. Statistically speaking, this is insignificant! What is never told, however, is a breakdown of those 30,000 deaths, to put them in perspective as compared to other causes of death:\\n\\n• 65% of those deaths are by suicide which would never be prevented by gun laws\\n• 15% are by law enforcement in the line of duty and justified\\n• 17% are through criminal activity, gang and drug related or mentally ill persons – gun violence\\n• 3% are accidental discharge deaths\\n\\nSo technically, gun violence is not 30,000 annually, but drops to 5,100. Still too many? Well, first, how are those deaths spanned across the nation?\\n• 480 homicides (9.4%) were in Chicago\\n• 344 homicides (6.7%) were in Baltimore\\n• 333 homicides (6.5%) were in Detroit\\n• 119 homicides (2.3%) were in Washington D.C. (a 54% increase over prior years)\\n\\nSo basically, 25% of all gun crime happens in just 4 cities. All 4 of those cities have strict gun laws, so it is not the lack of law that is the root cause.\\n\\nThis basically leaves 3,825 for the entire rest of the nation, or about 75 deaths per state. That is an average because some States have much higher rates than others. For example, California had 1,169 and Alabama had 1.\\n\\nNow, who has the strictest gun laws by far? California, of course, but understand, so it is not guns causing this. It is a crime rate spawned by the number of criminal persons residing in those cities and states. So if all cities and states are not created equally, then there must be something other than the tool causing the gun deaths.\\n\\nAre 5,100 deaths per year horrific? How about in comparison to other deaths? All death is sad and especially so when it is in the commission of a crime but that is the nature of crime. Robbery, death, rape, assault all is done by criminals and thinking that criminals will obey laws is ludicrous. That's why they are criminals.\\n\\nBut what about other deaths each year?\\n• 40,000+ die from a drug overdose–THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR THAT!\\n• 36,000 people die per year from the flu, far exceeding the criminal gun deaths\\n• 34,000 people die per year in traffic fatalities(exceeding gun deaths even if you include suicide) \\n\\nNow it gets good:\\n• 200,000+ people die each year (and growing) from preventable medical errors. You are safer in Chicago than when you are in a hospital!\\n\\n• 710,000 people die per year from heart disease. It’s time to stop the double cheeseburgers! So what is the point? If Obama and the anti-gun movement focused their attention on heart disease, even a 10% decrease in cardiac deaths would save twice the number of lives annually of all gun-related deaths (including suicide, law enforcement, etc.). A 10% reduction in medical errors would be 66% of the total gun deaths or 4 times the number of criminal homicides......Simple, easily preventable 10% reductions!\\n\\nSo you have to ask yourself, in the grand scheme of things, why the focus on guns? It's pretty simple.:\\nTaking away guns gives control to governments.\\n\\nThe founders of this nation knew that regardless of the form of government, those in power may become corrupt and seek to rule as the British did by trying to disarm the populace of the colonies. It is not difficult to understand that a disarmed populace is a controlled populace.\\n\\nThus, the second amendment was proudly and boldly included in the U.S. Constitution. It must be preserved at all costs. \\n\\nSo the next time someone tries to tell you that gun control is about saving lives, look at these facts and remember these words from Noah Webster: Before a standing army can rule, the people must be disarmed, as they are in almost every kingdom in Europe. The supreme power in America cannot enforce unjust laws by the sword, because the whole body of the people are armed and constitute a force superior to any band of regular troops that can be, on any pretense, raised in the United States. A military force at the command of Congress can execute no laws, but such as the people perceive to be just and constitutional; for they will possess the power.\\n\\nRemember, when it comes to gun control, the important word is “control, not “gun.",0,0

Not all automatic weapons are the same.\\n0:46 This is statistical abuse. While muzzle loaders have been around for *most* of The US's 241 years, semi-automatics have made up the vast majority of firearms since post WW1. Semi-automatics also include handguns, most shotguns, and most/many long rifles.\\n1:00 10 round magazines have only been normal for a few years now. 30 round magazines have been standard for decades. \\n1:26 The 2nd amendment does not imply use for hunting or home defense. The 2nd amendment is explicitly for the application of citizen militias and an armed population in response to the confiscation of weapons by the British government. \\n\\n\\nAll and all the fault of this video (aside from incorrect facts and lack of citation) is in not understanding what differentiates a semi-automatic assault rifle from any other style of firearm. Any metric you mentioned in this video could also be applied to handguns, non-assualt rifles, long rifles, and shotguns. In fact, handguns often have higher rates of fire, with higher caliber ammunition, with larger available magazines, and account for hundreds of times more shootings than what you're mistakenly referring to as semi-automatic rifles rather than assault-rifles.",0,0

Yet white people have  decided to attack  a black man Cam Newton over complete and other nonsense. So white Americans care  more about a fucking whore getting her feelings hurt 😭. Then the victims of a   white terrorist murderer who committed one of the worst terrorist acts in the history of America. My dad told me those white devils was going to change the subject about what happened in Las Vegas. And instead attack any black man they could get their hands on . Cam Newton was a easy  target because he defeated Tom Brady in New England which pissed that  racist white trash off.,1,0

Yet white people have  decided to attack  a black man Cam Newton over complete and other nonsense. So white Americans care  more about a fucking whore getting her feelings hurt 😭. Then the victims of a   white terrorist murderer who committed one of the worst terrorist acts in the history of America. My dad told me those white devils was going to change the subject about what happened in Las Vegas. And instead attack any black man they could get their hands on . Cam Newton was a easy  target because he defeated Tom Brady in New England which pissed that  racist white trash off.,1,0

1y7giHbrvcc,It kinda reminds me of up2u which is the song that made me fall in love with walk the moon so ya know I really like it,3,1
1y7giHbrvcc,"I can't understand any of the negative comments, seriously. Yes it's different to One Foot and the usual music we're used to from Walk The Moon, but that isn't a bad thing. It reminds me somewhat of Jenny, my favourite from this band- actually it might've just been knocked to second place by Headphones. I like the rock vibes.\\nI just wanted to say that just because it isn't what you're used to doesn't mean it's bad, and maybe you should give it a couple more listens before you decide you dislike it.",8,2

Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh, Arizona, Seattle, Dallas, Miami, etc etc all Liberal ran cesspools. Oh and don't forget how Dems just love celebrity's ( Witch accounts for most of thier funding)  Crying Chuck Shumer was a BIG Harvey Weinstein Supporter. You people won't stop until America and Europe is Destroyed, then what will you have? Nothing, except Illegals and Refugees who already hate you. One of my favorite quotes from the Legendary Winston Churchill. if your not a Liberal when your young, then you have no heart, if your not a Conservative when your old then you have no brain. Which means you should be getting smarter and wiser as you get older, not basing your opinions on emotions.

That's ok though, I think it's cool that they are releasing songs that are so different from one another. Headphones is nothing like one foot and it'll add variety to the album.

1y7giHbrvcc,Played it twice so far . Pretty good music but chorus not as catchy as all the rest of their songs and I own both albums . I'll check the new album on Spotify first when it comes out and if I like it a lot I'll buy the cd but I might have to listen to the album a number of times first to see if it grows on me and then maybe buy the cd .,0,1

Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh, Arizona, Seattle, Dallas, Miami, etc etc all Liberal ran cesspools. Oh and don't forget how Dems just love celebrity's ( Witch accounts for most of thier funding)  Crying Chuck Shumer was a BIG Harvey Weinstein Supporter. You people won't stop until America and Europe is Destroyed, then what will you have? Nothing, except Illegals and Refugees who already hate you. One of my favorite quotes from the Legendary Winston Churchill. if your not a Liberal when your young, then you have no heart, if your not a Conservative when your old then you have no brain. Which means you should be getting smarter and wiser as you get older, not basing your opinions on emotions.

YOU'RE IN LUCK. Check this out: this is the Black Panther orchestral theme!!!!!\\nand it's freaking fantastic! It's Epic sounding, just like it'd hoped, and it's not too contemporary, and makes very judicious and tasteful use of drums throughout! YES!!!! my concerns are completely alleviated!\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0PD8B_tSwQ&t=74s\\nlisten and just bathe in it's auditory glory.\\n(I still like the MoS score more, but I think this one will really stick with people and not just sound like every other Sylvestris theme).\\n*edit: upon second and focused hearing it reminds me very much of a modern drum-infused version of the Rambo theme from the 80s once the horns really kick in half way through. It's not quite as orchestral and big as I'd like, but it's still got the right feel. I look forward to seeing how the overall score fits.",0,0

kKJZqKxpZoE,"Blade Runner 2049 proves definitively that Marvel Is overrated. Hear me out. Objectively they are equal in quality, but the timing is why one is succeeding and one is failing. After 9/11 we were so perturbed still now that the villains won. To differentiate who are villains = hurt everyone indiscriminately so very few are true villains, but I digress back to why Marvel heroics and lack of villainship is very welcome to all no matter how mediocre/safe the movies are which In my opinion has been anything after Phase 1(good) til now. Blade Runner's dystopian means and ends are just too painful since 9/11. Believe me you can cite many examples of trends that have been overrated and underrated because of the times they are playing. That is why we have classics who prove they can transcend it. Think of the trends that were so popular in their day, but no one remembers 100 years from now. That is why the original Bladerunner Theatrical cut with narration is the ONLY classic mentioned in this post. The Ones that last have more well rounded vision plus quality and which more support, remember and commemorate them that make them last for generations. That is why the Good, Bad and the Ugly transcends while the other Spaghetti Westerns are thrown out only to be saved by Eastwood who is transcendent. Now if Marvel is greedy they will make Thanos, Killmonger and Hella non-factors as usual. If they want to be transcendent they will give them A LIFE and see their reign end.",0,0

kKJZqKxpZoE,"Hi\\nJust watched the Black Panther trailer 2, loved it, but I can’t help but think the music, to me, doesn’t represent what Black Panther embodies. We get the great cultural original clothing, we get the futuristic African society which also embraces tradition, yet when it comes to music I get more of a sense of western hip hop. \\nI understand you want the film to appeal to an American audience when it comes to advertising and marketing, and that when we finally see the film it will do a great job of bringing a worthy soundtrack that will give the impression of a technologically advanced nation, whose music is also of a traditional source with added symbolism and blended to include their uniquely innovative diverse African culture.\\nHopefully we can hear some of this in the next trailer to allay my apprehensions.\\nThanks, What do you think?",0,0

kKJZqKxpZoE,"Blade Runner 2049 proves definitively that Marvel Is overrated. Hear me out. Objectively they are equal in quality, but the timing is why one is succeeding and one is failing. After 9/11 we were so perturbed still now that the villains won. To differentiate who are villains = hurt everyone indiscriminately so very few are true villains, but I digress back to why Marvel heroics and lack of villainship is very welcome to all no matter how mediocre/safe the movies are which In my opinion has been anything after Phase 1(good) til now. Blade Runner's dystopian means and ends are just too painful since 9/11. Believe me you can cite many examples of trends that have been overrated and underrated because of the times they are playing. That is why we have classics who prove they can transcend it. Think of the trends that were so popular in their day, but no one remembers 100 years from now. That is why the original Bladerunner Theatrical cut with narration is the ONLY classic mentioned in this post. The Ones that last have more well rounded vision plus quality and which more support, remember and commemorate them that make them last for generations. That is why the Good, Bad and the Ugly transcends while the other Spaghetti Westerns are thrown out only to be saved by Eastwood who is transcendent. Now if Marvel is greedy they will make Thanos, Killmonger and Hella non-factors as usual. If they want to be transcendent they will give them A LIFE and see their reign end.",0,0

kKJZqKxpZoE,"Hi\\nJust watched the Black Panther trailer 2, loved it, but I can’t help but think the music, to me, doesn’t represent what Black Panther embodies. We get the great cultural original clothing, we get the futuristic African society which also embraces tradition, yet when it comes to music I get more of a sense of western hip hop. \\nI understand you want the film to appeal to an American audience when it comes to advertising and marketing, and that when we finally see the film it will do a great job of bringing a worthy soundtrack that will give the impression of a technologically advanced nation, whose music is also of a traditional source with added symbolism and blended to include their uniquely innovative diverse African culture.\\nHopefully we can hear some of this in the next trailer to allay my apprehensions.\\nThanks, What do you think?",0,0

It's Epic sounding, just like it'd hoped, and it's not too contemporary, and makes very judicious and tasteful use of drums throughout! YES!!!! my concerns are completely alleviated!\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0PD8B_tSwQ&t=74s\\nlisten and just bathe in it's auditory glory.\\n(I still like the MoS score more, but I think this one will really stick with people and not just sound like every other Sylvestris theme).\\n*edit: upon second and focused hearing it reminds me very much of a modern drum-infused version of the Rambo theme from the 80s once the horns really kick in half way through. It's not quite as orchestral and big as I'd like, but it's still got the right feel. I look forward to seeing how the overall score fits.",0,0

It's Epic sounding, just like it'd hoped, and it's not too contemporary, and makes very judicious and tasteful use of drums throughout!

kKJZqKxpZoE,"Blade Runner 2049 proves definitively that Marvel Is overrated. Hear me out. Objectively they are equal in quality, but the timing is why one is succeeding and one is failing. After 9/11 we were so perturbed still now that the villains won. To differentiate who are villains = hurt everyone indiscriminately so very few are true villains, but I digress back to why Marvel heroics and lack of villainship is very welcome to all no matter how mediocre/safe the movies are which In my opinion has been anything after Phase 1(good) til now. Blade Runner's dystopian means and ends are just too painful since 9/11. Believe me you can cite many examples of trends that have been overrated and underrated because of the times they are playing. That is why we have classics who prove they can transcend it. Think of the trends that were so popular in their day, but no one remembers 100 years from now. That is why the original Bladerunner Theatrical cut with narration is the ONLY classic mentioned in this post. The Ones that last have more well rounded vision plus quality and which more support, remember and commemorate them that make them last for generations. That is why the Good, Bad and the Ugly transcends while the other Spaghetti Westerns are thrown out only to be saved by Eastwood who is transcendent. Now if Marvel is greedy they will make Thanos, Killmonger and Hella non-factors as usual. If they want to be transcendent they will give them A LIFE and see their reign end.",0,0

kKJZqKxpZoE,"Hi\\nJust watched the Black Panther trailer 2, loved it, but I can’t help but think the music, to me, doesn’t represent what Black Panther embodies. We get the great cultural original clothing, we get the futuristic African society which also embraces tradition, yet when it comes to music I get more of a sense of western hip hop. \\nI understand you want the film to appeal to an American audience when it comes to advertising and marketing, and that when we finally see the film it will do a great job of bringing a worthy soundtrack that will give the impression of a technologically advanced nation, whose music is also of a traditional source with added symbolism and blended to include their uniquely innovative diverse African culture.\\nHopefully we can hear some of this in the next trailer to allay my apprehensions.\\nThanks, What do you think?",0,0

JdqUUKEATiw,"Przez ponad 6 lat miałam potworny trądzik, który spowodował tyle problemów z moją psychiką, że aż się wierzyć nie chce, że tylko pryszcze są w stanie wywołać tyle zamieszania. Najgorszy był okres gimnazjum, pamiętam jak jedna nauczycielka powiedziała mi, że muszę spróbować coś z tym zrobić, bo jest to naprawdę obrzydliwe. Szkoda, że nie wiedziała, że jestem już na dziesiątej terapii. Nie wiem dlaczego społeczeństwo dalej nie rozumie, że to jest choroba. Gdy widzieli mnie jak jem coś czekoladowego - mówili, że to przez to. Gdy widzieli mnie bez makijażu mówili, że powinnam chociaż trochę to ukryć podkładem. Gdy miałam podkład to mówili, że to jest obrzydliwe, że zakrywam moją prawdziwą twarz. Słyszałam wszystko - że się nie myje  i że mam grzyba na twarzy. Apogeum mojej nienawiści do siebie było w momencie gdy wchodząc do któregoś z kolei dermatolog pierwsze co usłyszałam to Pani nie wstyd z taką twarzą się pokazywać?. To słowa lekarza. LEKARZA.\\n\\nDzisiaj już nie mam trądziku, chociaż jak Ty boję się że on wróci. Ale do wszystkich osób, które też płaczą i wyją z powodu tej choroby chciałam tylko powiedzieć, żebyście nie przejmowali się tymi ignorantami, którzy rzucają w Waszą stronę obelgi i hejty.

JdqUUKEATiw,"Dziękuje za ten film! Ludziom wydaje się, że trądzik to tylko problem natury kosmetycznej. Tak naprawdę największe zmiany są nie do zauważenia przez osoby z zewnątrz gdyż zachodzą w psychice. U mnie trądzik zawładnął całym moim życiem. Stało się to wręcz obsesją-ciagle myśle co mogę zrobić, czego nowego użyć żeby się tego pozbyć, może kolejna wizyta u innego dermatologa, albo kolejna dawka izoteku. Ciągle jakaś nadzieja, że „to na pewno pomoże” jednak okazuje się, że niestety nie. Zamknąłem się w sobie, mało co wychodzę z domu, nie mam najmniejszej ochoty żeby się gdziekolwiek pokazywać, a czasem nawet odechciewa mi się żyć. Ciągła presja wywierana przez media typu telewizja czy instagram gdzie wszystko jest idealne tylko pogłębia depresje. Gdy już muszę wyjść z domu to czuje na sobie spojrzenia ludzi. Podświadomie wiem, że są to zwyczajne spojrzenia, ale w mojej głowie przedstawia się to tak, jakby Ci ludzie patrzyli na mój problem i czuje się przez nich osaczony. To całkowicie zrujnowało moją pewność siebie a co najgorsze również w pewnym sensie zdrowie-czekoladę jadłem ostatni raz chyba 6 lat temu, bo jak zjem to może to pogorszy sytuacje itp. Urwałem przez to kontakty ze znajomymi i można powiedzieć, że na własne życzenie zostałem sam z problemem, który męczy mnie już 8 lat... I w taki oto sposób ja, jako osoba umarłem a żyje we mnie trądzik, czyli jakby druga osoba która przywłaszczyła sobie moje życie.",4,0
JdqUUKEATiw,"Nigdy nie miałam trądziku, ale miałam cerę w tragicznym stanie. Mimo dbania o nią, makijaż nie utrzymywał się dłużej niż godzinę. Makijaż wyglądał tak, jakby ktoś przejechał po twarzy mokrą ściereczką i mocno pocierał. Wstydziłam się, gdy ktoś na mnie patrzył. Na szczęście zaczęłam brać leki, kupiłam kosmetyki z wyższej półki, regularnie chodzę do kosmetyczki i w końcu moja twarz wygląda w miarę normalnie, wiem, jakie to ciężkie, gdy wstydzisz się patrzeć na siebie w lustrze.",4,0

JdqUUKEATiw,"Kilka miesięcy temu, pod filmem o izoteku pisałam, że zaczynam walczyć z problemem. Było tylko gorzej. Było strasznie. Kaszka przestała być kaszką... obecnie jestem po 8 miesiącach izoteku. Moja buzia jest piękna, odpukać. Ale to co przeżyłam... koszmar. Dziękuję za ten film. Niewiarygodne jak choroba działa na psychikę.. Bywało, że budziłam się co noc .. tak koło 3ciej i biegłam do lustra, by zobaczyć czy choć jeden zszedł... Wchodząc do tramwaju ukrywałam się za szalem licząc, że nikt na mnie nie patrzy.. mało tego. Oceniałam wszystkich siedzących obok, czy oni też mają problem czy nie... chyba czułam się SAMA z tym problemem, dlatego. Odwracałam twarz od ukochanego, by tylko na mnie nie patrzył - to bolało najbardziej.. i jego i mnie. Apogeum było w święta Bożego Narodzenia (2016). Każdy, na Boga, każdy przy wigilijnym stole życzył mi  i żeby Ci to zeszło z twarzy. Pierwszy raz usłyszałam tak bolesne życzenia.

JdqUUKEATiw,"Najgorzej jest odkryć trądzik przed ludźmi. Zawsze zakrywałam swój problem, zamiast go zwalczać. Dopiero gdy Pani dermatolog definitywnie zakazała mi nakładania makijażu, tak naprawdę rozpoczął się mój prawdziwy problem. Moje życie przewróciło się do góry nogami. Zakrywałam twarz włosami, chodziłam ze spuszczoną głową, nikomu nie patrzyłam w oczy, odizolowałam się od ludzi. Był to mój największy kompleks. Do tej pory, codziennie dbałam o to, aby przed wyjściem rano z domu wyglądać perfekcyjnie. A tu nagle ja i obrzydliwe, czerwone krosty na twarzy, widoczne z końca ulicy? Nie obyło się bez dnia bez płaczu, braku chęci do wstania z łóżka. Miałam nawet w planach odsunąć od siebie najbliższych, bo nie chciałam, by musieli patrzyć na moją odpychającą twarz i wstydzić się za takie straszydło. Dobrze jednak, że wybili mi to z głowy i przez całą, długą walkę, wełną wzlotów i upadków, wspierali. Z całego serca jestem im wdzięczna. Teraz pozostały tylko blizny, także najgorsze za mną.\\nMasz rację. Ten, kto nigdy nie miał poważnego problemu z cerą, NIGDY tego nie zrozumie. Może gdy raz rano namaluje sobie na całej twarzy czerwone kropki i będzie tak chodził cały dzień, chociaż odrobinę pojmie ten ból. Wzrok wszystkich na Ciebie i dociekanie pewnie myśli o mnie, jaka jestem ohydna. Nawet człowiek o mocnych nerwach, jak ja, wymięka.\\nŻyczę powodzenia wszystkim, którzy walczą!

JdqUUKEATiw,"Jejku, nareszcie czuję, że ktoś to rozumie :') Mam trądzik od około 4kl podstawówki, a pamiętam, że już wcześniej pojawiły się często na mojej twarzy pojedyncze krostki. Byłam przez to gnębiona i nielubiana aż do końca podstawówki. Przez to zdazalo się, że specjalnie symulowalam chorobę, żeby nie iść do tego okropnego miejsca, pełnego osób z gładką cerą, które tego nie rozumiały. Dodam też, że nie miałam zbytnio przyjaciół, jedynie 2 dziewczyny z którymi była to bardziej relacja koleżeńska, więc nie miałam komu się wygadac. Rodzina również nie reagowala. Oprócz trądziku jestem niestety posiadaczką mocno przetłuszczającej się cery (z którą nadal się zmagam, mimo mocnego nawilżania twarzy) więc, z tego też zawsze mi dokuczali, a wiadomo, jako dziecko nic nie mogłam z tym zrobić, mimo że regularnie mylam twarz. Wracając, wcześniej jakoś sobie radziłam, ale w końcu w 6 klasie nie wytrzymalam i się będąc głupim dzieciakiem pocięłam się, czego nadal bardzo żałuje. Jednak nadal, zero reakcji, ale to i lepiej, nie chciałabym, żeby inni mieli kolejny powód do plotek. No, ale szybko zniknęło, problem załatwiony, jednak urazy z tej podstawówki zostały. Od zawsze byłam nieśmiała i bardzo nerwowa, a po tym wszystkim to się tylko pogłębiło. Naszczęście, poszłam potem do gimnazjum. Nowa klasa, nowe osoby, czysta karta. Mimo że wtedy się jeszcze nie malowałam ani nie dbalam o cerę, nigdy odkąd jestem w gimnazjum nie usłyszałam nic przykrego na ten temat, przynajmniej nie prosto w twarz. To serio poprawiło moją samoocene. Zaczęłam się otwierać na ludzi i byłam w stanie normalnie pójść do sklepu bez strachu, że ktoś się na mnie krzywo spojrzy przez trądzik. Obecnie jestem w 2 kl gimnazjum, nadal się zmagam z trądzikiem i wieloma bliznami po nim i mimo że się maluje, przez co nie widać tego aż tak, jestem w stanie wyjść np na miasto bez zakrywania go. Jednak mimo wszystko, zle wspomnienia zostają i zostaną pewnie juz na całe życie, przez co często mnie męczą przed spaniem. Więc z własnego doświadczenia powiem, że trądzik naprawdę potrafi doprowadzić do wielu urazów na psychice. Jest to naprawdę straszne, tym bardziej że jakby nie patrzeć jest to naturalna rzecz, na którą nie mamy wpływu. \\nRozpisalam się i pewnie wszystko jest napisane chaotycznie, ale jakoś czułam potrzebę wygadania się, tym bardziej, że na yt jestem anonimowa. Pewnie nikogo to nie obchodzi, ale jesli ktoś dotrwał do końca to gratulacje, a wszystkim, z których się śmieją z tego powodu powiem jedno: olejcie ich, naprawdę, szkoda tylko czasu i nerwów.

JdqUUKEATiw,"W końcu ktoś o tym powiedział! Sama mam trądzik, który co chwile wraca i bardzo utrudnia mi życie, czuję, że popadam w depresję, przy rozmowie nie umiem spojrzeć drugiej osobie prosto w oczy, nigdy nie wychodzę z domu bez makijażu, nawet gdy idę wyrzucić śmieci czy do sklepu pod blokiem. Po prostu nie umiem się przełamać, zamknęłam się na ludzi i najchętniej to tylko bym siedziała już zawsze w domu i nigdy nie wychodziła ze swojego łóżka, ale trzeba jakoś żyć. Trądzik to nie tylko parę pryszczy na krzyż, to choroba, która niesie ze sobą dużo złego oraz zostawia po sobie brzydkie ślady, które mogą być bardzo trudne do wyleczenia. Dziękuję Ci za ten film i życzę Ci, żebyś już nigdy nie musiała się martwić trądzikiem.",0,0

BVKnt7H4zVc,"To be fair, a few things:\\n– On any phone, how many people let a heavy duty blade, or any sharp blunt object, come in contact – with heavy pressure – with their phone?\\n– On any phone, how many people let a flame stay on the glass, let alone for that long? A flame directly on the glass... really?\\n– On any phone, how many people put the glass face out/down in their back pocket? If you sat on a hard uneven surface, your body pressure might crack the glass screen. I put my phone in my back pocket but always with the glass towards my butt (for more cushion, haha). Notice when he bent it, the curve was facing glass-out. In other words, it wouldn't be smart to put the face of the phone facing out so when you sat down the glass would be down on the seat of the chair (or hard surface). But it would have to be some heavy pressure, especially with a layer of jeans between the glass and sitting surface.  (yeah I'm technical but anyway...)\\n– Of course the coating isn't metal. The main frame is metal. Besides, you gave it a good cutting and scraping before the metal was showing through the coating. Who does this with normal use?\\n– And, lastly, most people get a phone case and/or screen protector anyway. Or a skin like the one your sponsor makes.",0,0

BVKnt7H4zVc,"Jesus the drawn out but subtle rant about plastic was drawn out and subtle. You clearly do not like the plastic feel, but don't right out admit to it. Instead you just scratch the back for a year to show that you really don't like that it has a plastic coating. Other than that the phone seems to be really amazing, which I feel you really tried to make the phone seem terrible. The camera is good, build quality is good, the screen is good, speakers are good, and the performance is good. But it bendy wendy is not a good argument to make the phone outright horrible, I have had a 6P for almost two years and it has yet to come close to bending. If you take these bend tests as breaking the deal or not then you might not know how to really pick a phone. Just because it doesn't have things like a second camera, headphone jack, or wireless charging does not mean the phone is not worth the price. The Pixel has a good camera, the headphone jack is subjective and I do not care for it, and I don't need wireless charging. The Pixel is buttery smooth, great software, great speakers, great camera, and a big battery.

It's Epic sounding, just like it'd hoped, and it's not too contemporary, and makes very judicious and tasteful use of drums throughout! YES!!!! my concerns are completely alleviated!\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z0PD8B_tSwQ&t=74s\\nlisten and just bathe in it's auditory glory.\\n(I still like the MoS score more, but I think this one will really stick with people and not just sound like every other Sylvestris theme).\\n*edit: upon second and focused hearing it reminds me very much of a modern drum-infused version of the Rambo theme from the 80s once the horns really kick in half way through. It's not quite as orchestral and big as I'd like, but it's still got the right feel. I look forward to seeing how the overall score fits.",0,0

kKJZqKxpZoE,"Blade Runner 2049 proves definitively that Marvel Is overrated. Hear me out. Objectively they are equal in quality, but the timing is why one is succeeding and one is failing. After 9/11 we were so perturbed still now that the villains won. To differentiate who are villains = hurt everyone indiscriminately so very few are true villains, but I digress back to why Marvel heroics and lack of villainship is very welcome to all no matter how mediocre/safe the movies are which In my opinion has been anything after Phase 1(good) til now. Blade Runner's dystopian means and ends are just too painful since 9/11. Believe me you can cite many examples of trends that have been overrated and underrated because of the times they are playing. That is why we have classics who prove they can transcend it. Think of the trends that were so popular in their day, but no one remembers 100 years from now. That is why the original Bladerunner Theatrical cut with narration is the ONLY classic mentioned in this post. The Ones that last have more well rounded vision plus quality and which more support, remember and commemorate them that make them last for generations. That is why the Good, Bad and the Ugly transcends while the other Spaghetti Westerns are thrown out only to be saved by Eastwood who is transcendent. Now if Marvel is greedy they will make Thanos, Killmonger and Hella non-factors as usual. If they want to be transcendent they will give them A LIFE and see their reign end.",0,0

JuYYsmQ2ulI,"Aliens are demons. This world; Its ALL biblical. We are the last generation. Evil is rampant because Satan knows his time is coming to a close he is trying hard to drag all to hell with him. He's doing a fine job. People are all in a deep sleep and care only about being entertained trying to be famous and shopping in strip mall's and listening to terrible satanically inspired music etc. Its a Godless world and all will be totally surprised when Jesus comes and they get left to deal with Satan in reality with all his demons which instead of being invisible will be completely visible to the naked eye. Only then will people believe this world is all one giant spiritual battle. Jesus died for us, loves us, and wants us to escape hell which is an actual place. \\n\\nToss aside this temporary world. If you do not know Jesus Christ or believe in God, I urge you to start. Whether you believe or not does not change the fact that The One and Only Jesus Christ is on his way....shortly. Like days. How many? Not sure. But my spirit feels it. This world is messed up. You must admit that. Its all a lie...all the things you think make you happy are lies. The devil hates you and is laughing at you. Jesus loves you. He died for you and the entire world. Even if you don't  love him. He is waiting for you to receive him in your heart. If you are ready to receive Jesus into your heart pray this prayer before it's too late. This is an urgent warning. Pray: Jesus I am a sinner, I believe you died on the cross for me and my sins and rose from the dead. Please forgive me of all my sins I am repenting now and I ask you to enter my heart right now. Change me. I want to make you happy. I want to be happy and go to heaven. I do not want to be stuck in the tribulation. Help me to open my spiritual eyes and ears before you get here. I ask this in Jesus name Amen! \\n\\nIf you just prayed this prayer welcome to the family! You made the most important decision of your life right now. Don't stop praying and remember a prayer can be a simple as Jesus, help me!  now get a bible or an app and read about revelation. And read Matthew and John chapters. For a start. I pray you made the right decision and prayed that prayer. See you in heaven!💛💛😘👏👍😊 \\n\\nTwitter: @YoNaturefreek",0,0

JuYYsmQ2ulI,"Ok...I feel like this needs to be said. I've watched this series now for about 6 months, and for the most part I enjoy the Unsolved episodes. I'm a fan of the way the channel tells these real-life stories and offers speculation. I hated this episode. Regardless of where you stand on aliens, I think we can agree that there's not enough conent on this topic to reliably cover it with the level of detail or facts that, say, the Zodiac episode portrayed. I won't argue that there was at least one concrete piece of data per story, but in my mind it takes more than that to make a claim defensible I felt like this episode dove WAY too deep into speculation without regard for the facts to back it up, and I hope this doesn't become a theme in later episodes.",1,1

BVKnt7H4zVc,"I own the phone. Everyone is complaining about things that will likely never happen. This is just a test. I could put a gun to my head and pull the trigger as a test to see if I die, and of course I would die, but that doesn't mean I'll realistically ever do it. The only noteworthy thing is the bend test. How much force did it take for it to bend? The man's hands are shaking and I don't see him as a little guy. I doubt most people will be putting that much pressure on it and if you think you are simply get a case. Most people won't burn it but scratches to happen regularly and I think I'll be okay since this phone's screen is pretty hard to scratch.\\n\\nTo touch on what people talk about in the comments:\\n\\nManufacturers are visionaries and are pushing to advance rather than stay stagnant by taking the headphone jack off. If you maintain it, it gives no initiative for people to move to wireless, and that's the entire purpose. Jump to 2040 and I doubt you'll be wanting anything that's wired. I think this is a great thing as long as we keep security protocols to protect our connections and data.\\n\\nPhone cases and tempered glass protectors exist for a reason if you're concerned about damaging the phone, as well as protection plans.\\n\\nMemory isn't an issue for me as long as the bulk, pictures and videos, will have unlimited cloud storage at full resolution. I bought the 128GB version that should be plenty for most.\\n\\nWireless charging seemed cool to me when it first came out but I really don't need it. I like how fast my Pixel 2 charges and how long it lasts.\\n\\nIn my opinion it's worth the buy, the software definitely did it for me. You don't see all the customizations on these reviews but you can do a lot with the phone and going back to hardware while we're on software the fingerprint sensor is an absolute blessing (you can drag your notification bar up and down with it for example).\\n\\nThis is my opinion, all I'm saying is try something yourself before you kill it based on someone else's  views.

Anyone can say 'this is just a hardware review, not software, but simply ignoring the integration is silly. For me, it's Pixel or iPhone, I like the experience on both and the level of control each has with hardware and software integration. The reason(s) why people like iphones are the same reason(s) they choose google android phones over other brands, full control of the hardware, software, and entire experience.",0,0
BVKnt7H4zVc,"This is an overall weak hardware compilation by Google (no wireless charge, scratchy exterior, sub-par oled display (2XL), poor durability, and mere ip67) I bough this phone already and I am very happy that I did. I'm a software first guy, but while I generally make purchases based on software ui and features, I appreciate your candor in admitting that your ruthless review is based solely on the hardware. Google has to step up to at least the minimum in that department, but the pure Android on pixels is a matchless experience.

The water resistance is slightly different from most phones but the fuck you wanna go scuba diving with your phone???? The headphone jack is outdated technology.

BVKnt7H4zVc,"I personally think Google should be taking a page out of One Plus's book with their Pixels....\\nIt's fine if they don't want to be focusing on all these new hardware features because the software more than makes up for it. However it's absolutely shocking that I would admit the OnePlus software of Oxygen OS is better than the Pixels Stock software if I was totally honest with myself!!!\\n\\nOne Plus allows you to do a ton of stuff like change from capasitive to on screen navigation bar (I know the Pixel doesn't have a capasitive nav bar but still), change the systems colour sceme!!!, utilise a built in app locker with the finger print sensor, change the colour of the notification dot, detect whether to turn the screen on with Pocket Mode, change the battery icon, assign custom actions to different uses of the navigation bar, (I want to mention the alert slider but I guess that's hardware), adjust the screens colour temperature, use HQ in the camera and save RAW photos, duel SIM (again kind of hardware but still software related), used a ton of gestures to enable stuff unlike the Pixel which has like 1 gesture, fastest finger print sensor ever, and that's only the start!! There's a ton more. \\n\\nLike seriously if the Pixel had all of these features along with it's already incredible software expirience it would be the best phone ever made!!!",0,0

iKYQN5xMRQg,"Too much ignorance or stupidity in many of the comments! The driver was NOT almost killed! These race cars are built with several roll cages & cages around the engine. They're built safer than anything driven on a public roadway! The driver of the black car drove over the hood...that has a cage around the motor. Other than ripping the guys carb off & damaging the sheet metal & left wheel, he didn't threaten the other guy's life at all. If he'd drove into the driver door...still protected by a cage, it may be another story, but NONE of that happened. \\nHillbilly comments...wow! People making these silly comments apparently have never taken a drink of alcohol in their life! A quick history lesson for you... Moonshiners & bootleggers had fast cars to transport their liquor & get away from the police. They would race each other to see who had the fastest cars. Hence, the birth of NASCAR. When the cars were wrecked, they'd use them in demolition derbies to destroy the cars. The birth of another sport. \\nIt's sad that people who don't have a clue about many things in life, feel the need to show just how ignorant they are by making idiotic comments.
