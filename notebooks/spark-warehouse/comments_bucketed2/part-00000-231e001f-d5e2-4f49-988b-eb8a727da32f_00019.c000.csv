I set the bixpy app to factory reset which would be its state before i activated it, and now every so often within a longer interval of seconds the phone will wake itself up as if im pressing the power button. This even happens when i shut it down and its charging, i dont press the button yet the screen will wake up to show the percentage when its off or go to the screen before you unlock the phone while its on. What do you think the problem is? i dont know if its taxing on the battery when its on and it wakes the screen up but its rather annoying",0,0

hQbeB0YXLhs,"First time view and I subscribed. I'm glad to see a positive review of the Fenty foundation, I feel like people who don't like it are used to a foundation that gives more dewy-ness. I'm curious how it compares to the Hourglass Liquid to Powder, which I have but it's old and thickened up. But let me ask a question, people keep saying it oxidizes, but a lot a matte liquid lipsticks dry down darker and I don't think people say those oxidize. I consider a foundation to oxidize if it darkens throughout the wear time as it breaks down. Cars don't rust instantly,  it's a slower chemical reaction. I think anything that is liquid to powder just darkens a little with dry down, so you just need to swatch and go with something that appears lighter in its liquid form but dries down to its actual color. Thoughts? \\nI also got the primer, touch up powder & brush, and some samples to try; slapping it all on tomorrow so fingers crossed it's as good as you made it look!",0,0

I set the bixpy app to factory reset which would be its state before i activated it, and now every so often within a longer interval of seconds the phone will wake itself up as if im pressing the power button. This even happens when i shut it down and its charging, i dont press the button yet the screen will wake up to show the percentage when its off or go to the screen before you unlock the phone while its on.

lno7AN8hLvQ,"Dude, I would probably have had a colostomy by now if I had not stopped using toilet paper and started using flushable wet wipes.  Back then, there was only one brand for adults [Charmin', I think].  Now there are many brands, including some he-manly ones called Dude Wipes [which I have not tried...I'm not nearly butch enough] and some relatively inexpensive generic ones that work just fine.  Several manufacturers also make various travel or carry-along versions, some of which even fit neatly in the back pocket of jeans.  [The trouble with the portable ones are that they can be hard to find [Walmart! has been a reliable source], so buy a bunch when you find them. For years, I never left home without them.  Now, I seem to have cured my IBD with a fiber regimen, but that is for a rant of another day.  So, just stop the madness, ditch the TP and get some good soothing wipes.

B2B0GMtowmU,このブランドに文句言う人は何も分かっていない。\n若者というのはカジュアルさを求める。86やロードスターといったバリバリのスポーツカーは値段の割に実用性が高いとは言えない。これでは若者を取り込めるはずがない。\nカジュアルを好む若者にとっては見た目や雰囲気だけ、或いは足回りだけちょっと弄ってある、その事実で十分。本当に高性能化したってそれを公道で活かせる機会は殆どいないし、サーキットに通い詰める人も殆どいない。\nミニバンにGRがあるのはまさしくそれで、例えば子持ちの親がスポーツカーが欲しいと思っても実用性が低いから家族の反対に遭って買えない、子供が居なかったとしてもバリバリのスポーツ仕様はちょっとハードルが高そうだから買えない、だからせめて雰囲気だけでもスポーティにしよう、そういったニーズに絶妙にマッチした車種をラインナップしている。\n勿論本格スポーツを求める人だっているんだから、その為にGRMNをラインナップする。\nカジュアルさって大事だよ。バイクが売れない一因に魅力的な車種がないというものがあるけど、それはカジュアル向け、即ち250ccに魅力的な車種が少なかったからであって、カワサキがNinja250を導入したら飛ぶように売れ、その後各社がフルカウル、ストリートファイター、アドベンチャー等多様な車種を250ccで販売したらどれもメーカー在庫切れが多発するぐらいには売れた。\nトヨタはそこを本当に分かっていて、このGRを始めとしてTRDやモデリスタといった公式カスタムモデル及びパーツを数多く揃えている。公式だからパーツ適合や工程、車検等諸問題を気にする必要は無いし、最初から完成されたカスタムモデルを買ってもいいし、好きなパーツだけ買って自分好みにカスタムすることもできる。\nカジュアルだけどそこから多少マニアックに踏み込むというのはまさしく若者に受ける最大の要素だと思うよ。自分自身も若者だからこういうラインナップはとてもありがたい。バイク乗りだからメーカーはもっとこういう感じに公式のカスタムモデルやパーツ増やして欲しいわ。絶対もっとバイクが売れるよ,0,0

This also applies to hotels. A nice hotel is not defined by its rooms or its price.

B2B0GMtowmU,このブランドに文句言う人は何も分かっていない。\n若者というのはカジュアルさを求める。86やロードスターといったバリバリのスポーツカーは値段の割に実用性が高いとは言えない。これでは若者を取り込めるはずがない。\nカジュアルを好む若者にとっては見た目や雰囲気だけ、或いは足回りだけちょっと弄ってある、その事実で十分。本当に高性能化したってそれを公道で活かせる機会は殆どいないし、サーキットに通い詰める人も殆どいない。\nミニバンにGRがあるのはまさしくそれで、例えば子持ちの親がスポーツカーが欲しいと思っても実用性が低いから家族の反対に遭って買えない、子供が居なかったとしてもバリバリのスポーツ仕様はちょっとハードルが高そうだから買えない、だからせめて雰囲気だけでもスポーティにしよう、そういったニーズに絶妙にマッチした車種をラインナップしている。\n勿論本格スポーツを求める人だっているんだから、その為にGRMNをラインナップする。\nカジュアルさって大事だよ。バイクが売れない一因に魅力的な車種がないというものがあるけど、それはカジュアル向け、即ち250ccに魅力的な車種が少なかったからであって、カワサキがNinja250を導入したら飛ぶように売れ、その後各社がフルカウル、ストリートファイター、アドベンチャー等多様な車種を250ccで販売したらどれもメーカー在庫切れが多発するぐらいには売れた。\nトヨタはそこを本当に分かっていて、このGRを始めとしてTRDやモデリスタといった公式カスタムモデル及びパーツを数多く揃えている。公式だからパーツ適合や工程、車検等諸問題を気にする必要は無いし、最初から完成されたカスタムモデルを買ってもいいし、好きなパーツだけ買って自分好みにカスタムすることもできる。\nカジュアルだけどそこから多少マニアックに踏み込むというのはまさしく若者に受ける最大の要素だと思うよ。自分自身も若者だからこういうラインナップはとてもありがたい。バイク乗りだからメーカーはもっとこういう感じに公式のカスタムモデルやパーツ増やして欲しいわ。絶対もっとバイクが売れるよ,10,2
B2B0GMtowmU,そんな100万200万で車作れっていう方がむりだよあほ、\n軽でも150する時代だぞ。\n保険や税金が払えないんじゃないほんとに好きなやつはたとえ低所得関係ないね。そんな事言うなら自分で車作れや価格帯考えてよ。ポンコツしかできんのに文句たれるなこのバカタレが。日本人アホばっかだからなぁ自分の気に入らないとすぐ文句ばっかたれやがる、,8,0
B2B0GMtowmU,普段からエコカーやミニバンを生産しまくってスポーツカーと無縁な事ばかりして性能の良い車、速い車を持ってる人は暴走族みたいな、スポーツカーに対して悪いイメージばかり植え付けてきた癖に何がスポーツカーブランドだ\nコンパクトカーやミニバンを造るなとは言わないが、かつてはセダン中心で性能重視な車が多かったのに(チェイサー、カルディナ、ブレイド等)その路線を捨て、数えきれない程の種類のコンパクトカーとミニバンとエコカーを今は造っている\nせめて昔の性能重視の路線に戻りエコカーやミニバンの種類を少なめにしてからスポーツカーブランド語れや\nトヨタが遅くてつまらない車、人が乗るだけの荷車を大量生産するからスポーツカー持ってる人に悪いイメージがついてスポーツカー離れになってるの分かってるのか\n原因はトヨタなんだよ,7,0
B2B0GMtowmU,維持、税金、保険が高くて正直うんざりだけど、それでも車好きなんでMTの86買うために必死にお金貯めてますよ！他のメーカーも時代の流れで色々難しいところはあるのかもしれないけど若者にも買いやすい価格設定でスポーツカー出してほしいですね...。　以上一人暮らし20代前半からの意見でした。,0,0

B2B0GMtowmU,俺の周りを見る限り、スポーツカーはスポーツとは無縁のオタクが乗ってるイメージ笑\n\nそもそも調子乗った運転でもしようものならドライブレコーダーで録画されてYouTubeにアップされるような時代にスポーツカーが流行るとは思えん！,2,0

B2B0GMtowmU,やっぱりトヨタ！,3,2
B2B0GMtowmU,「スポーツカーじゃない」って言ってる方がいますが、はい、スポーツカーではありませんよ。\n\n「GR」は「快適に速く走りたい！でもカリカリにしたりするのはちょっと...」という人や、「家族がいるし、スポーツカーは...」という方でも手軽にスポーツ走行が楽しめる、それが「G's」であり、いまの「GR」。スバルの「STI」に近いですね。これらはモータースポーツが技術元で、そこから抽出した技術で作ったものです。\n快適な走行を目的としたグレードだから、スポーツカーでなくても関係ないんですよ。\n\nそれより上を求めるなら「GRMN」や、「GR SPORT」、86なら14-R60に乗るべきです。\n\n86はパワーがありません。それはNAならではの「操る楽しさ」を求め、またNAエンジンなら後から手をユーザーが加えることが出来るので、敢えてそうしたのです。\n\nまた、過給器チューンは速いですが、高回転まで回し続けるのは馬力を損ないます(回し過ぎず、早めに繋ぐほうが速い)。なので、「車そのものを楽しむ」という趣向で作られた86はNAでいいのです。\n\nまた、200万円100万円のスポーツカーは現在の法律では不可能でしょう。安全基準が違いますからね。\n出してくれるなら本当に嬉しいですけど。,2,2
B2B0GMtowmU,トヨタさんよぉ\nスバルのエンジン載っけるより\n3S-GE、1JZ-GTEみたいな\n鋳造ヤマハエンジン造って\n載っけろよ。\nそれと無駄な機能とか装備とかに\nコストかけんじゃねーよ。\nスープラ、MR2、ソアラ、AE86と\n比べると見劣りする。,1,2
B2B0GMtowmU,カッコいいって\n言ってる人がいて\nちょっとゾッとした…\n\nどこがカッコいいの？？真面目に\n\n現代において\n完成された車を\nいじったら\nほぼ99%の確率で\nダサくなるだけだと思う。,1,1
B2B0GMtowmU,そうやって否定する人が軽に乗れば。後見なければいいじゃん。,1,1
B2B0GMtowmU,いやいやいアンチ必死過ぎだろ！！！！！wwww,4,3
B2B0GMtowmU,なんだかんだでNSXもGTRも売れてるんやし、トヨタも完全自社生産で1000万くらいするスポーツカー作ればいいのに。max350キロのハイブリッドでミッドシップスポーツなんか作ったら超話題になると思うんだけどなぁ。あぁでもポルシェが似たようなの作ってな……。,0,5

I hope you don't take this as an insult because I still love you and I won't unsubscribe because you've helped me with so much, I'll definitely buy your book when it comes out! I know it must be hard to talk about anything else when you are a mum, but I would love to see videos like your old one, or like this but just talking about something else other than motherhood/children etc. Please don't take this too harshly, it's just something I'd personally like to see!!

oD7nZouNyDA,"I remember you said you ran out of things to do for this channel. I suggest just do updates, q&a and reviews, those things never stop. You always need to have updated videos because things are always changing, you always have a new skincare routine, have new favorite products, etc. With the q&a People will always have questions. The reviews, there is always new products that needs to be reviewed & it would be very helpful and useful for people to see reviews before buying the product. Beauty isn't just outer appearance, I think you can include lifestyle type of videos too and just advices/girl talk videos. I think with makeup looks, there always music videos, movies and celebrities and It doesn't necessarily need to inspired you to emulate the look but it can be taken as a fun challenge too. There is many colors that can paired together and create new looks. There is also fashion, that is part of beauty too and there is always fun silly beauty related tags/games or beauty hacks you can incorporate in your channel.",0,0

Pxojz6grwcU,"Prions, it is what's for dinner. Look into it. Spongy form encephalitis. Look into the Prp2 gene and what it has mutated. They do not make them bend, they rub against and upload data, altering the cell, changing it. You need to do more research. Prions cannot be destroyed, by fire, radiation, cold, bleach.  The only way to diagnose it in the brain. See Holstein Cow   1992. There are n6 new reports because they only check cows that died in the trailer of the truck.  They torture the cows with electricity and water and literally jolt them off the truck.  No cows are checked for mad cow. Many cases of dementia and Alzheimer are believed to be BSE related. However, autopsies are rearly done on the brains of the dead, in search of prion activity. Prion's can remain on the earth for hundreds of years, as sun, heat and the elements do not kill them. Soon as a cow now grazes upon the prion infected grass they can become infected. I have written a lengthy report on this subject. One percent of one percent of beef is inspected in the states. No one checks the brains. It is not allowed. Do more research and try not to sound so ??? not sad, or affected  whilst reporting on this subject. You did provide some great info on the CJD. This is the  mutated version that is now passed from mother to child. Do more research. I applaud your attempt. It is a good start to a scary subject. Also check into how the prion has made its way into the veggies. Interesting read.",0,0

B2B0GMtowmU,このブランドに文句言う人は何も分かっていない。\n若者というのはカジュアルさを求める。86やロードスターといったバリバリのスポーツカーは値段の割に実用性が高いとは言えない。これでは若者を取り込めるはずがない。\nカジュアルを好む若者にとっては見た目や雰囲気だけ、或いは足回りだけちょっと弄ってある、その事実で十分。本当に高性能化したってそれを公道で活かせる機会は殆どいないし、サーキットに通い詰める人も殆どいない。\nミニバンにGRがあるのはまさしくそれで、例えば子持ちの親がスポーツカーが欲しいと思っても実用性が低いから家族の反対に遭って買えない、子供が居なかったとしてもバリバリのスポーツ仕様はちょっとハードルが高そうだから買えない、だからせめて雰囲気だけでもスポーティにしよう、そういったニーズに絶妙にマッチした車種をラインナップしている。\n勿論本格スポーツを求める人だっているんだから、その為にGRMNをラインナップする。\nカジュアルさって大事だよ。バイクが売れない一因に魅力的な車種がないというものがあるけど、それはカジュアル向け、即ち250ccに魅力的な車種が少なかったからであって、カワサキがNinja250を導入したら飛ぶように売れ、その後各社がフルカウル、ストリートファイター、アドベンチャー等多様な車種を250ccで販売したらどれもメーカー在庫切れが多発するぐらいには売れた。\nトヨタはそこを本当に分かっていて、このGRを始めとしてTRDやモデリスタといった公式カスタムモデル及びパーツを数多く揃えている。公式だからパーツ適合や工程、車検等諸問題を気にする必要は無いし、最初から完成されたカスタムモデルを買ってもいいし、好きなパーツだけ買って自分好みにカスタムすることもできる。\nカジュアルだけどそこから多少マニアックに踏み込むというのはまさしく若者に受ける最大の要素だと思うよ。自分自身も若者だからこういうラインナップはとてもありがたい。バイク乗りだからメーカーはもっとこういう感じに公式のカスタムモデルやパーツ増やして欲しいわ。絶対もっとバイクが売れるよ,10,2

B2B0GMtowmU,普段からエコカーやミニバンを生産しまくってスポーツカーと無縁な事ばかりして性能の良い車、速い車を持ってる人は暴走族みたいな、スポーツカーに対して悪いイメージばかり植え付けてきた癖に何がスポーツカーブランドだ\nコンパクトカーやミニバンを造るなとは言わないが、かつてはセダン中心で性能重視な車が多かったのに(チェイサー、カルディナ、ブレイド等)その路線を捨て、数えきれない程の種類のコンパクトカーとミニバンとエコカーを今は造っている\nせめて昔の性能重視の路線に戻りエコカーやミニバンの種類を少なめにしてからスポーツカーブランド語れや\nトヨタが遅くてつまらない車、人が乗るだけの荷車を大量生産するからスポーツカー持ってる人に悪いイメージがついてスポーツカー離れになってるの分かってるのか\n原因はトヨタなんだよ,8,0

B2B0GMtowmU,「スポーツカーじゃない」って言ってる方がいますが、はい、スポーツカーではありませんよ。\n\n「GR」は「快適に速く走りたい！でもカリカリにしたりするのはちょっと...」という人や、「家族がいるし、スポーツカーは...」という方でも手軽にスポーツ走行が楽しめる、それが「G's」であり、いまの「GR」。スバルの「STI」に近いですね。これらはモータースポーツが技術元で、そこから抽出した技術で作ったものです。\n快適な走行を目的としたグレードだから、スポーツカーでなくても関係ないんですよ。\n\nそれより上を求めるなら「GRMN」や、「GR SPORT」、86なら14-R60に乗るべきです。\n\n86はパワーがありません。それはNAならではの「操る楽しさ」を求め、またNAエンジンなら後から手をユーザーが加えることが出来るので、敢えてそうしたのです。\n\nまた、過給器チューンは速いですが、高回転まで回し続けるのは馬力を損ないます(回し過ぎず、早めに繋ぐほうが速い)。なので、「車そのものを楽しむ」という趣向で作られた86はNAでいいのです。\n\nまた、200万円100万円のスポーツカーは現在の法律では不可能でしょう。安全基準が違いますからね。\n出してくれるなら本当に嬉しいですけど。,2,2
B2B0GMtowmU,トヨタさんよぉ\nスバルのエンジン載っけるより\n3S-GE、1JZ-GTEみたいな\n鋳造ヤマハエンジン造って\n載っけろよ。\nそれと無駄な機能とか装備とかに\nコストかけんじゃねーよ。\nスープラ、MR2、ソアラ、AE86と\n比べると見劣りする。,1,2
B2B0GMtowmU,アンチコメ何も分かってないw\n 何で、車体価格が上がっているか分かってる？\n 税金、クルマ離れ、デザイン、全く関係ない。 安全基準がひと昔より厳しくなったなのと各メーカーの安全装備競争が価格の底上げをしているのに気付こうねw\n 80年代の頃は、まだまだ安全装備が最低限だったからねw\nここまで、チャレンジするトヨタの覚悟は素晴らしいと思うよ\n  デザインや性能のアンチコメ\n萎えるわw確実に性能上がってるからw\n後は、自分で性能上げれば？ まず出来ないけどね〜w  デザインなんか好き嫌いあるからね〜〜\n 今のご時世他社と協業しないと企業として成り立たないからw国内だけじゃないよ、相手は外資メーカーだから\nトヨタには、もっと挑戦して欲しい。,0,0

I know it must be hard to talk about anything else when you are a mum, but I would love to see videos like your old one, or like this but just talking about something else other than motherhood/children etc. Please don't take this too harshly, it's just something I'd personally like to see!!

oD7nZouNyDA,"I remember you said you ran out of things to do for this channel. I suggest just do updates, q&a and reviews, those things never stop. You always need to have updated videos because things are always changing, you always have a new skincare routine, have new favorite products, etc. With the q&a People will always have questions. The reviews, there is always new products that needs to be reviewed & it would be very helpful and useful for people to see reviews before buying the product. Beauty isn't just outer appearance, I think you can include lifestyle type of videos too and just advices/girl talk videos. I think with makeup looks, there always music videos, movies and celebrities and It doesn't necessarily need to inspired you to emulate the look but it can be taken as a fun challenge too. There is many colors that can paired together and create new looks. There is also fashion, that is part of beauty too and there is always fun silly beauty related tags/games or beauty hacks you can incorporate in your channel.",0,0

We really need to just study what France does and copy everything as closely as possible to lower healthcare expenses.

KUH0KQ1qMiw,"The problem with healthcare has nothing to do with insurance or some policy that some politician has failed at including Obama AND Trump.  Until the pricing for services is under control nothing will change. How much does it cost if you break your arm and go to the ER? No one can answer that question: If you're on Medicaid it costs x, if you have one insurance company it cost 20x, another insurance company might be 30x... and no insurance? Try 200x.  Hospitals have no published pricing and can basically charge you for whatever they want to at any price they want. This is the problem - 20 administrators for every actual doctor. Your anti-trump rants solve nothing. Obamacare is failing and you people don't want to admit that. If you were really trying to help the people like you claim, you would acknowledge that and present an alternative.

E7HqW6S-g7c,"bruh i wish our store had coconut donuts. instead we've got 2 kinds of jelly [sugar and iced] and festive fall. oh, and apple and blueberry crumb but apple is way better. the apple filled in this episode is an apple n spice. the one link complains about is our classic cake donut :D they also come with chocolate frosting!\\n\\nalso that vanilla frosted with cute pastel sprinkles is adorable. the maple donut is either a maple long john or maple eclair- difference being LJ have white vanilla filling like bismarks and chocolate icing and E have the vanilla/banana [depends on how you taste it] filling with chocolate icing. boston kremes are the same thing.\\nour apple fritters i've not had, but i have had a customer ask for one to be warmed up after they bought it so hey if that's your thing- go for it?\\n\\nif you wanna ask for their favorite donut without having to search for it on the racks, just ask for a 'chocolate glazed' or a 'glazed chocolate' donut. glazed is the keyword! frosting will just be a normal yeast donut with chocolating icing. sometimes there'll be double chocolate as well- a glazed chocolate with chocolate icing.\\n\\nalso not all of our stores carry donuts with nuts- the one i work at doesn't but if i did, i'd know since i've got a nut allergy lol. we still have the allergen sign up tho",0,0

BY3SLVNBkeo,"It was very easy to teach our cats to play with us directly and not damage us. As soon as they use their nails, stop, say ow! with a crying lilt in your voice,  and touch the paw that caused the problem. They learn very quickly. Now our cats even play rake (with their hind legs) our arms using only their pads when we tickle their belly. Same with biting: just stop moving (don't pull away) and say Ow!. Obviously it requires overriding your immediate response as well; pulling away from a claw or bite does more damage (to you) than just freezing. It makes play much more enjoyable for both of us rather than simply using a toy.",0,0
BY3SLVNBkeo,Why do I attract lunatic cats that look absolutely crazy,0,0
BY3SLVNBkeo,"I always have played with my cats using my hands to teach them to be gentle with their teeth and claws. I teach them to be gentle by giving them a command as soon as they bite or use their claws and even more better if you can catch it before it happens. Once i know the cat understands the command i slowly stop using the command until it becomes second nature to the cat not to bite down hard or use their claws on humans.Reason why i do this is sometimes even thou you may watch them very carefully around kids, accidents do happen. So i've taught every cat i have owned to be gentle. If you do not introduce them to be gentle with hands, they will not learn how to be gentle when kids or stranger hands touching them.  \\n\\nAlso i suggest to put away any string or fishing rod toy that dangles in the air or any small toys when you can not watch your cat. Fishing toys can be dangerous too. I had one experience with my cat who love fishing toys. One day i was holding her fishing rod toy it in the air. She jump down from her cat tree running full speed and jump for the fishing toy and the rope accidentally wrapped around her front leg. I am glad when i felt the tug in my hand i let go. I could see her licking her front leg and shoulder blade for couple of minutes and shaking her front leg. I brought her to the vet just in case. Vet said nothing too serious with her leg. Probably just a slight pull but nothing to be concern about. However since that incident she never wants to play with any type of fishing rod toy, she runs away from that toy now.",0,0

BY3SLVNBkeo,"After having a cat for a few years, my husband brought home a kitten to help with his separation anxiety when we leave for work. The rescue kitten absolutely loves every toy we have, like strings, bell balls, and every other thing she can get her paws on (including garbage and socks) but the older one only likes his battle worn fishing rod with a mouse on the string.  Sadly, the kitten was a stray who hasnt quite learned that feet and hands are not toys, but it's been far easier trying to teach her not to bite and draw blood than it has been to teach my husband not to rough house with her. Its taken weeks to convince him that her aggressions towards us is directly related to using hands for play, something that gets her frustrated and angry, and its still a constant issue trying to get him to understand that he needs to stop playing and ignore her when she goes after hands instead of toys. Honestly he's far more difficult to train than the cats xD",0,0

I only play with toys that they can actually catch and leave the video games (laser toys).\\nBeyond that, his favorite activity was watching my mice run in their wheels.  Both he and Fluffy respected them, so MOST of my mice, if nothing else, tolerated his presence (when I was around; this is also why my dogs and cats are forbidden in my room unless I'm in there).  I swear that it was like porn to him.  Fluffy just preferred to ignore my mice (no sense in wanting what you can't have).",0,0

It is not a continual fun trip of parties and vacations on the Med Coast.  It took people striving and working to build the prosperous society we have today.  It did not just pop into existence.\\n\\n3 - I'm gonna take a wild guess and say both of you guys are staunch libs..... very likely Bernie Sanders supporters and   surely voted for Hillary.\\n\\nAs such, I'm certain you just LUUUUVVVVV all those free social programs Bernie and the Dems push.\\n\\nBut, in your short sighted and hedonostic thinking, fail to ponder the question of demographics.\\n\\nSimply put .... money.  All those free programs require, or will require, a fuck ton of money to pay for them.  That means society needs a solid base of working age people.  \\n\\nAs it stands now, the worker to retiree/beneficiary ratio has been  declining fir decades as a greater % of the population is over 65 as well as being enrolled in Medicaid.  That means an ever higher tax burden on those in the workforce.\\n\\nSo...... in closing ..... if you really LUUUUVVVVVVVVV all those free programs you should be encouraging people to have even more babies to support both of you in your old age\\n\\nCheers",0,0

ccLXx4DB8ZQ,"This is the only video yours that I disliked. Your audience doesn't need excuses why they shouldn't have kids (which is what you gave throughout the video), they will be making the decision on having a child based on emotional factors. All the reasons for not having a child are pretty superficial. I'm childless because I want to enjoy my life. 99% of my friends and co-workers are parents and they simply have no life. I want to have the freedom to go wherever I want, read a book, go study a new skill, play games, socialize, travel.... having a kid is detrimental to all that. The parents I met that tried to claim otherwise were REALLY deluding themselves. But most importantly, I don't see a child as some end-game goal for life. I'm living for myself, not some future kid.

How about since we have less money we should be doing something else trying to get more maybe? KDs a great basketball player! From outward appearances he's a great guy too. When I'm at work in certain situations arise I slam my former employer too. And when other situations arise I slam my current employer and co-workers.

How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher? 15 How will they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who [e]bring good news of good things!”16 However, they did not all heed the [f]good news; for Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?” 17 So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word [g]of Christ.",0,0

Besides not testing nearly enough of the cattle we eat, the cattle are slaughtered at less than 2 years old. Which is long before BSE would be detectable. And even one prion is enough to eventually kill you, the amount you eat just determines how long the incubation period is.

KUH0KQ1qMiw,"Under Obamacare my health care deductible increased from 1000USD to 1200USD and I was mandated by law to have health insurance -- not to mention that Obama also raised my FIFA by 150USD that same year. Fact: Obamacare sure as hell didn't help me -- not only did the leftist policy raise my rate, but it literally forced me to have health insurance. The  _individual mandate_ was supposed to bring policy prices down, but it did not do such for me. Also, they lied when they pushed it as a 'commerce' amendment when the Supreme Court interpreted it as a 'tax' amendment. If they pushed the amendment as a new tax from the get-go, it would have likely received less support.   \\n\\nIt should go back to the way it was -- and  if  the [state] governments want to help out needy peeps making under 25K or so, then they can decide to do so out of their budgets, without forcing me to have health insurance -- much less one controlled by a non-efficient government. For example, when I was younger, with more certainty about my health, I could decide to put more money into college than into health insurance; the choice should be the individual's.",0,0

Now our cats even play rake (with their hind legs) our arms using only their pads when we tickle their belly. Same with biting: just stop moving (don't pull away) and say Ow!.

BY3SLVNBkeo,"I always have played with my cats using my hands to teach them to be gentle with their teeth and claws. I teach them to be gentle by giving them a command as soon as they bite or use their claws and even more better if you can catch it before it happens. Once i know the cat understands the command i slowly stop using the command until it becomes second nature to the cat not to bite down hard or use their claws on humans.Reason why i do this is sometimes even thou you may watch them very carefully around kids, accidents do happen. So i've taught every cat i have owned to be gentle. If you do not introduce them to be gentle with hands, they will not learn how to be gentle when kids or stranger hands touching them.  \\n\\nAlso i suggest to put away any string or fishing rod toy that dangles in the air or any small toys when you can not watch your cat. Fishing toys can be dangerous too. I had one experience with my cat who love fishing toys. One day i was holding her fishing rod toy it in the air. She jump down from her cat tree running full speed and jump for the fishing toy and the rope accidentally wrapped around her front leg. I am glad when i felt the tug in my hand i let go. I could see her licking her front leg and shoulder blade for couple of minutes and shaking her front leg. I brought her to the vet just in case. Vet said nothing too serious with her leg. Probably just a slight pull but nothing to be concern about. However since that incident she never wants to play with any type of fishing rod toy, she runs away from that toy now.",1,0

Your audience doesn't need excuses why they shouldn't have kids (which is what you gave throughout the video), they will be making the decision on having a child based on emotional factors. All the reasons for not having a child are pretty superficial. I'm childless because I want to enjoy my life. 99% of my friends and co-workers are parents and they simply have no life. I want to have the freedom to go wherever I want, read a book, go study a new skill, play games, socialize, travel.... having a kid is detrimental to all that. The parents I met that tried to claim otherwise were REALLY deluding themselves. But most importantly, I don't see a child as some end-game goal for life. I'm living for myself, not some future kid. No wonder countries with superb living standards have negative birthrate, they know there's more to life than having kids.",0,0

ccLXx4DB8ZQ,"1. Don't marry or have kids with someone who has a vastly different idea about how kids should be raised, and this won't be an issue. I mean, if only there was a way to talk to someone about what their ideas of raising kids are like before you marry them, right?\\n\\n2. Oh no! Not a little bit of sleep loss! I've probably lost more than 6 months of sleep in the last few years just from my education. Are you honestly trying to tell me that a little sleep loss is a good enough reason to not have children? This seems like an extraordinarily selfish reason, but then, you seem like extraordinarily selfish people. So that's not surprising.\\n\\n3. It has nothing to do with how hard you work? Are you fucking stupid? Do you not understand the consequences of the double standard you yourself have pointed out? Employers see fathers as being legally OBLIGATED to provide for their children, whereas they see mothers as people who can put their children first because they'll receive government assistance if they don't feel like working those extra 20 hours this week. So, yes, it has everything to do with how employers see you, because they've learned from experience that the parent who is legally obligated to work for their childrens' benefit is more likely to be hard-working.\\n\\n4. Of course a child is expensive. Why in the hell do you think people have to work for their living? At least, if you want the child to have a certain sort of lifestyle. On the other hand, the vast majority of the people in the world who have children aren't the kind of arrogant middle-class suburbanites that gave rise to the types of ideologies that produce the kinds of self-centered selfishness that you two are displaying.\\n\\n5. So your argument is that people who want to have kids and then have them are just as happy as the people who don't want to have kids and so don't have them? Your argument is that people who get their way are happy? How is this an argument? What about the people who are forced into having children when they don't want to, or the people who desperately want to have children, but can't? How does your argument affect them? Have you even considered these people, or does the idea that someone might not get their entire life on a silver platter so very alien to you that you can't even conceive of it?\\n\\n6. Sorry, but the environmental argument doesn't hold much weight for me. First off, we don't actually know what the carrying capacity of the planet is or could be. New challenges (in the form of higher populations and population densities) have triggered adaptations to technology before that have resulted in increased carrying capacity. There's no reason to think that that process will actually stop. As far as trying to go green go vegan and so forth, I'm not trying to do any of that. Most of us in the world aren't trying to do that. It's a very arrogant and very bourgeois set of ideas, but I guess you can't tell from your lofty perch.\\n\\nAs for the beginning of the video, you say no one should be telling you whether you can or can't have kids or whatever, but that's clearly what you're trying to do. And as for the people moronically arguing that this is an informative rather than a persuasive video, the title says it all. The title is the thesis, and you can't have a thesis like Why you shouldn't have kids if the point of your argument is not to persuade. Shouldn't is the key word, if you're wondering. You're smugly telling people how they shouldn't do something based on nothing more than some very flimsy and easily-countered arguments. It makes you come off as extremely immature, and generally morally bankrupt.",1,0

Fair enough. However when you claim people who voluntarily choose not to have kids are just as happy as those who do I don't believe taking people on their word is reliable.

It is not a continual fun trip of parties and vacations on the Med Coast.  It took people striving and working to build the prosperous society we have today.  It did not just pop into existence.\\n\\n3 - I'm gonna take a wild guess and say both of you guys are staunch libs..... very likely Bernie Sanders supporters and   surely voted for Hillary.\\n\\nAs such, I'm certain you just LUUUUVVVVV all those free social programs Bernie and the Dems push.\\n\\nBut, in your short sighted and hedonostic thinking, fail to ponder the question of demographics.\\n\\nSimply put .... money.  All those free programs require, or will require, a fuck ton of money to pay for them.  That means society needs a solid base of working age people.  \\n\\nAs it stands now, the worker to retiree/beneficiary ratio has been  declining fir decades as a greater % of the population is over 65 as well as being enrolled in Medicaid.  That means an ever higher tax burden on those in the workforce.\\n\\nSo...... in closing ..... if you really LUUUUVVVVVVVVV all those free programs you should be encouraging people to have even more babies to support both of you in your old age\\n\\nCheers",1,0

He visited India and made a comment and got trolled and he had to apologize for it. If he wants to engage with anyone twitter thats his business. Who is anyone to criticize him for doing that. These so called honest analysts are the most biased if you ask me. If things don't happen the way they think its supposed to happen, they just scream foul.",0,0
hbfxFdl8B8M,This is the social media age. Look at all the people commenting here. Why are we killing Kevin Durant for defending himself on Twitter YouTube Facebook wherever? Just because he has more money than the rest of us we feel like he should be doing something else with his time. How about since we have less money we should be doing something else trying to get more maybe? KDs a great basketball player! From outward appearances he's a great guy too. When I'm at work in certain situations arise I slam my former employer too. And when other situations arise I slam my current employer and co-workers. I think we all do I do it privately KD turns the Twitter. He's 29 in the social media age. You guys have fun with this KD Twitter Facebook YouTube stuff I'll have fun watching the Golden State Warriors!,0,1

Kimmel has no idea what actual working people have to do to keep insurance. He keeps crying about his kid, but it's all bullshit. Ben Shapiro kid was in the same hospital with the same doctor and had open heart surgery, there was no problem there. Kimmel is playing his brain dead fans like a $2.00 fiddle.\\nMost of the dumbasses on here defending him probably don't have insurance anyway because they don't (won't)  work. And if you are on Obamacare, you can thank the people who work for a living that pay for it. You can keep your crappy doctor.  The one that replaced the great doctor that is.  You get pissed off when Trump tweets a gif,  but Jimmy Kimmel can whine about Trump and his wife? Where was this gutless turd when Obama was stinking up the joint with that transgender wife of his?

I guess people in developed countries have it good and are way too attached to comforts that lessen somewhat when having a child – so very sad. Our dependence on comfort will be the end of us. People in less developed countries certainly don’t ponder over how much it will cost (there is no money to begin with, so nothing to lose), over the damage to their welfare (there is none to begin with, so again, nothing to lose), over the discrimination in a job application process (there are no jobs to start with, so once again, nothing to lose)…\\nWhen we strip off all the indulgencies of modern society, all that remains is…err…raw life?

Do the math on the portion of your life less employable vs the rest of it! Carbon footprint - that's just an atrocious anti-humanistic argument. No, kids aren't really a bundle of joy most of the time but they are the greatest source of meaning in any person's life.

The only solution to stop the global population from exploding is for either the governments of countries with these issues, like India, to fund programs that educate their people to have less children, or for the cultures of such places itself to change and model themselves after western ways, so having two children becomes a societal norm. Don't guilt people into not having children with your overpopulation scam, because the developed world's population is stable and even dipping in some places.

ccLXx4DB8ZQ,"I don't understand these comments. What does the video have to do with white people? So what if the white gene dies out? It was probably meant to die out anyways. Humans are being more widely socially interactive than ever and since dark skin is more dominant than light skin it's more likely that all humans will become the same shade of brown in the future. It's just the way evolution works. The climate gets warmer so more dark pigmentation is needed. That's a good thing, you know (not climate change but pigmentation change). Do y'all wanna look like boiled lobsters when spring arrives? Overpopulation is a real thing, but still if you decide to have a child (or even two) that won't contribute much to the world population as the children will just replace their parents and well, not all children will grow up and be able to reproduce themselves. But adoption is a good alternative if you want to have a child because they're already in need of a loving parent.

BY3SLVNBkeo,"I always have played with my cats using my hands to teach them to be gentle with their teeth and claws. I teach them to be gentle by giving them a command as soon as they bite or use their claws and even more better if you can catch it before it happens. Once i know the cat understands the command i slowly stop using the command until it becomes second nature to the cat not to bite down hard or use their claws on humans.Reason why i do this is sometimes even thou you may watch them very carefully around kids, accidents do happen. So i've taught every cat i have owned to be gentle. If you do not introduce them to be gentle with hands, they will not learn how to be gentle when kids or stranger hands touching them.  \\n\\nAlso i suggest to put away any string or fishing rod toy that dangles in the air or any small toys when you can not watch your cat. Fishing toys can be dangerous too. I had one experience with my cat who love fishing toys. One day i was holding her fishing rod toy it in the air. She jump down from her cat tree running full speed and jump for the fishing toy and the rope accidentally wrapped around her front leg. I am glad when i felt the tug in my hand i let go. I could see her licking her front leg and shoulder blade for couple of minutes and shaking her front leg. I brought her to the vet just in case. Vet said nothing too serious with her leg. Probably just a slight pull but nothing to be concern about. However since that incident she never wants to play with any type of fishing rod toy, she runs away from that toy now.",2,0

They travel in complete comfort and luxury with entire teams dedicated to making sure your okay and they'll pull you from a game if you feel a bit sore. They want to extend the season and make fans wait even longer to watch? Come on. If it translated into better playing that would be one thing, but it doesn't.",0,0

hbfxFdl8B8M,this criticism is ridiculous. We want kobe to play for 20 years. Anything that extends their careers is better. We don't want them to be earl monroe and be out of the league by the time they should be in their prime because back to backs and four in 5 make them REAL MEN.,0,0

How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard? And how will they hear without a preacher? 15 How will they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written, “How beautiful are the feet of those who [e]bring good news of good things!”16 However, they did not all heed the [f]good news; for Isaiah says, “Lord, who has believed our report?” 17 So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word [g]of Christ.",0,0

KUH0KQ1qMiw,"What Jimmy Kimmel May Not Know About The Healthcare Bill\\n\\nPosted By Kristan Hawkins On 3:41 PM 09/25/2017\\n\\nEvery time that a new health care reform bill is introduced, it causes panic. Newly-minted health care expert Jimmy Kimmel, who has previously mocked Obamacare’s failures, quickly rushes in to denounce any attempt to move away from Obamacare. I feel for Kimmel’s concerns for sure, which is why I support Graham-Cassidy. When it comes to repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, the hyperbole usually varies from, “This will destroy people’s lives,” on one side, to “This doesn’t go nearly far enough,” on the other side of the issue. Meanwhile many Americans just ignore the pundits and scare tactics coming from Washington as they are relatively healthy with few health concerns. For me, that is not the case.\\n\\nI am the mother of four children who are my world, inspiring me to fight for their future every day of my life. However, what really separates me from many other people is that two of my children, Gunner and Gracie, have Cystic Fibrosis (CF). CF is a deadly disease, which currently has a median age expectancy of 37 years, and requires daily, time-consuming and expensive medical care. It only affects about 30,000 Americans, and, currently, there is no cure. So for a middle-income family such as mine, any change in healthcare could result in reduced coverage, thousands in medical bills, and delays in the treatments and medicines that Gunner and Gracie need.\\n\\nLast week, following the introduction of the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson healthcare reform bill, several rare disease associations sent out several alerts opposing the bill and supporting Obamacare. As someone who faces this cystic fibrosis daily, I needed to know why these groups were supporting Obamacare, which is imploding, unsustainable, and already leading our nation towards a single-payer healthcare system.\\n\\nWhat is clear is that single-payer systems are not the solution, especially when every day matters and yearlong delays in single-payer systems are common as government entitles and pharmaceutical companies haggle over the price of life-extending drugs.\\n\\nJust ask those who suffer from cystic fibrosis in the UK, who have been waiting since 2015 for their government to approve Orkambi, which researchers believe could add a decade onto CF life expectancies. My son, Gunner, has been on the drug for more than a year already. We’ve already seen significant improvements, delaying the vicious plans cystic fibrosis has for wrecking his body.\\n\\nAdvocates of the ACA like to say that those who push for this reform bill don’t understand what it is like to face the hard decisions that having a pre-existing condition requires each day. It’s not true for me, nor of one of this plan’s chief authors, Senator Rick Santorum.\\n\\nLike me, Senator Santorum has a daughter, Bella, who has a rare, genetic disorder that leads to high medical and prescription bills.  So why would he write a bill that would hurt his family and those with pre-existing conditions, a bill that (if the other side’s hype is to be believed) would lead to the denial of coverage for those with pre-existing conditions?\\n\\nThe simple answer is that he wouldn’t, and he didn’t. The Graham-Cassidy bill does not eliminate Title 1 of the Affordable Care Act. In fact, it can’t. What it does is allow a state to apply for a waiver that would exempt it from Title 1. In order for this waiver to be granted, the state though must certify that affordable, stable insurance options are available to those with pre-existing conditions. Simply put, states are required to cover those with a pre-existing condition, but we give them the flexibility outside of a mandate, to do this task.\\n\\nAnd the best part of giving states control of how healthcare is managed is that real changes can be created. If my home state of Minnesota passes plans that fail to cover my children and their needs, you can bet your bottom dollar I’ll be personally knocking on the doors of my state legislators. I’ll be lobbying in St. Paul. I’ll be contacting the local press. I won’t simply be a number calling into the D.C. office of my U.S. Senators who will never hear my concerns. I’ll take it right to the decision makers.\\n\\nSome argue that this bill would destroy Medicaid, which would lead to millions of people losing their heath care. In fact, this bill would put Medicaid on a sustainable path that would continue to rise with inflation. In introducing his extremist “Medicaid for All” plan, Senator Bernie Sanders said that the best way to lower health care costs was to make people go through the government. If he were right, then it should not take an extraordinary hike in Medicaid spending each year to cover his plan. Raising Medicaid spending based on inflation should be more than enough to cover the people it needs to cover. So why are liberals against this plan but for “Medicaid for All?”\\n\\nTwo words are the answer to that question: Trump and abortion. If Graham-Cassidy passes, President Trump will cement his legacy as President. If he can’t, then realistically Americans are stuck with the ACA forever or at least until we’re broke and no more money can be printed to pay for it all.  And Sanders’ plan would give government money directly to the abortion industry while the Graham-Cassidy bill would defund Planned Parenthood and protect the rights of the pre-born.\\n\\nIs this bill perfect? No, but when comparing this bill to the travesty that is the Obamacare status quo and the disastrous financial trajectory it has put our nation on, there really is no choice. And by allowing states a hand in addressing where healthcare spending is invested, the choice to invest in life-affirming providers rather than the nation’s number one abortion provider is long overdue.\\n\\nKristan Hawkins (@KristanHawkins) is president of Students for Life of America.\\n\\nURL to article: http://dailycaller.com/2017/09/25/what-jimmy-kimmel-may-not-know-about-the-healthcare-bill/",0,0

Seriously though, whens the last time you had Adam on? \\n\\nGetting to the topic, I think its really shitty that your just now getting interested in the common folks healthcare. According to my research, guild members get access to better doctors than the military. Obama care was screwed up, just like Trump care will be. Thousands of people died under Obamacare due to inadequate resources. Im really over hollywood celebrities maintaining their status quo by jumping on the bandwagon of the ignorant.

As soon as they use their nails, stop, say ow! with a crying lilt in your voice,  and touch the paw that caused the problem. They learn very quickly. Now our cats even play rake (with their hind legs) our arms using only their pads when we tickle their belly. Same with biting: just stop moving (don't pull away) and say Ow!. Obviously it requires overriding your immediate response as well; pulling away from a claw or bite does more damage (to you) than just freezing. It makes play much more enjoyable for both of us rather than simply using a toy.",1,1
BY3SLVNBkeo,"I always have played with my cats using my hands to teach them to be gentle with their teeth and claws. I teach them to be gentle by giving them a command as soon as they bite or use their claws and even more better if you can catch it before it happens. Once i know the cat understands the command i slowly stop using the command until it becomes second nature to the cat not to bite down hard or use their claws on humans.Reason why i do this is sometimes even thou you may watch them very carefully around kids, accidents do happen. So i've taught every cat i have owned to be gentle. If you do not introduce them to be gentle with hands, they will not learn how to be gentle when kids or stranger hands touching them.  \\n\\nAlso i suggest to put away any string or fishing rod toy that dangles in the air or any small toys when you can not watch your cat. Fishing toys can be dangerous too. I had one experience with my cat who love fishing toys. One day i was holding her fishing rod toy it in the air. She jump down from her cat tree running full speed and jump for the fishing toy and the rope accidentally wrapped around her front leg. I am glad when i felt the tug in my hand i let go. I could see her licking her front leg and shoulder blade for couple of minutes and shaking her front leg. I brought her to the vet just in case. Vet said nothing too serious with her leg. Probably just a slight pull but nothing to be concern about. However since that incident she never wants to play with any type of fishing rod toy, she runs away from that toy now.",2,1

ccLXx4DB8ZQ,"All of that is so true! Having kids is EXHAUSTING both physically and emotionally. But, that's only one side of the coin said by people who've never experienced having a child. It's like saying going to the gym, gardening, college, etc., don't come with sacrifice and hard work, all of which can make you and society much stronger and from which we learn. Most definitely people should NOT be having children to fulfill their family and friends expectations, this is absolutely irresponsible. There was a time when I thought I'd never have children because of my lifestyle. My decision to have children definitely did not come lightly, and I've taken an approach very different than the standard status quo. To make the choice to have children is to choose to sacrifice and contribute something positive to the world, IF you are doing it responsibly. There is no job more important than raising another human being. This may make you feel uncomfortable and upset for me saying it, I did me before I was a parent, but its the truth. Those without children, whether their own or adopted, only see the tilling of the soil, the muddy boots, the back pain, the pests eating away the young plant. From the outside, they can't see the little buds forming, the roots growing, the plants growing stronger. Certainly they CANNOT taste the fruit! You gotta get dirty to appreciate gardening. I don't mean to say you've gotta enjoy getting dirty, I mean to say you've gotta do it to truly enjoy the harvest. \\n\\nThere is a mental and hormonal shift that comes with parenthood, you can't experience it from babysitting or passively watching your friends and family raise their children. Amongst all the sleep deprivation, wasted money, and overall change of lifestyle, there are amazing moments that seem to balance it all out. Time stands still in the precious moments our children create. Money doesn't matter. Your smokescreen identity in your career or lifestyle don't matter. Your tired body couldn't care less. \\n\\nFor those of you who think children will wreck your relationship, YES, they sure as hell can. IF you are already weak. Otherwise parenting WILL strengthen your ability to work together, your love, your ability to compromise, make you more compassionate, more patient, and all around change you in ways you can't currently see from inside the window. \\n\\nOne last thought. Do we REALLY think humanity would have continued if there was nothing to gain emotionally from raising children, from parenting? Silly childless people, you know nothing. ;) Now, thank your mother for having you! \\n\\nAnd remember, kids don't actually NEED that much stuff. Kids don't actually COST that much money.  But they DO need your time and unconditional LOVE, something kids rarely get these days. THINK about it. Don't let society and the statistics of consumerism dictate your life choices.",0,0

People get kids only for selfish reasons like 'awww I want a family' and 'aww kids are sooooo cuteeee' but they only enjoy the first 6 years while the child is still a child. Life is not a fairytale and we all know it, yet we still decide to bring another human being into this world. All we do in life is going to school, going to work, paying taxes and die. I think its selfish for me to decide that another human being must go through that shit. Especially in our generation with the internet the kids wont have a normal childhood anymore. The suicide rate is growing every year because the internet disconnects us and we are losing motivation to follow the same routine everyday. Thats not a life worth living, in my opinion. If you want to be such a good person better adopt a child that was already brought into this world and try to make their life better. But nooooo most people want their own kids...",0,0

Or white lives matter! Or fuck you homos...sadly I was right.\\nA question though formed in my mind. If you know who this two guys are and what they do for living you'd know that this isn't propaganda of any kind but an informative video talking about what is usually not said.\\nInformal conversation:\\n-hi, how old are you?\\n- I'm 26 \\n-are you married? Got any kids?\\n-not yet but I don't want kids \\n-you'll change your mind trust me, kids are so important! You will regret it! You won't feel fulfilled if you don't procreate!\\nNever heard something like that? \\nBy the way, if you don't know them? Before attacking them just watch to some of their videos to see what they really mean when they talk about any kind of topic. Nothing! They don't mean anything! They just go find informations for people who are too lazy to do it and try to help them understand different aspects of their life (yes, science and life are the same) and teach something other then who won the last football match.\\nDon't worry though, I can't wait to have children!",1,0

I guess people in developed countries have it good and are way too attached to comforts that lessen somewhat when having a child – so very sad. Our dependence on comfort will be the end of us. People in less developed countries certainly don’t ponder over how much it will cost (there is no money to begin with, so nothing to lose), over the damage to their welfare (there is none to begin with, so again, nothing to lose), over the discrimination in a job application process (there are no jobs to start with, so once again, nothing to lose)…\\nWhen we strip off all the indulgencies of modern society, all that remains is…err…raw life? A good reason to have a kid, obviously. \\nI would like to pose a little exercise for anyone/everyone who reads this: if you had nothing to lose, what would be your reason to have a kid?

There really aren't any good reasons here: oh no, you're not gonna be as happy - selfish, oh no, they cost money - they drive you to become more efficient and earn more, oh no, a woman will be less employable - for like 14 years until the kid is more or less responsible, after you have like the rest of your life to work, you know how long people live?! Do the math on the portion of your life less employable vs the rest of it! Carbon footprint - that's just an atrocious anti-humanistic argument. No, kids aren't really a bundle of joy most of the time but they are the greatest source of meaning in any person's life.

Don't guilt people into not having children with your overpopulation scam, because the developed world's population is stable and even dipping in some places.

They want to extend the season and make fans wait even longer to watch? Come on. If it translated into better playing that would be one thing, but it doesn't.",0,0

hbfxFdl8B8M,this criticism is ridiculous. We want kobe to play for 20 years. Anything that extends their careers is better. We don't want them to be earl monroe and be out of the league by the time they should be in their prime because back to backs and four in 5 make them REAL MEN.,0,0

He visited India and made a comment and got trolled and he had to apologize for it. If he wants to engage with anyone twitter thats his business. Who is anyone to criticize him for doing that. These so called honest analysts are the most biased if you ask me. If things don't happen the way they think its supposed to happen, they just scream foul.",0,0
hbfxFdl8B8M,This is the social media age. Look at all the people commenting here. Why are we killing Kevin Durant for defending himself on Twitter YouTube Facebook wherever? Just because he has more money than the rest of us we feel like he should be doing something else with his time. How about since we have less money we should be doing something else trying to get more maybe? KDs a great basketball player! From outward appearances he's a great guy too. When I'm at work in certain situations arise I slam my former employer too. And when other situations arise I slam my current employer and co-workers. I think we all do I do it privately KD turns the Twitter. He's 29 in the social media age. You guys have fun with this KD Twitter Facebook YouTube stuff I'll have fun watching the Golden State Warriors!,0,1

Our bodies are extremely fragile and could've only came to be through perfect circumstance. Our minds can be easily tricked and because of our senses, we never really see our world how it truly is. Be that as it may, we are literally the eyes of the Universe looking back on itself. Through the right evolutionary processes, we have come to be on this little space rock we call home. We can see and hear the world around us. We can attempt to understand it through scientific means and learn new things everyday. We can connect with each other and feel beautiful emotions like happiness, contentment, and love. Even though these are creations of our minds, they are still very real to us. I feel very special yet humbled by these thoughts. We should appreciate and enjoy life. We should love and help one another.

ILDy6kYU-xQ,"Definitely body with a mind.\\nEverything you experience and imagine is just the firing of electrical signals and pathways through neurons in the brain. Therefore, the mind (the sum of these signals) is very much a physical thing. The brain is as much a physical organ as the lungs or kidneys. The mind merely functions as a way for the body to learn about and perceive its surroundings (to find food etc) so that it can survive another day with the chance at reproduction. Bodies with brains that have a greater ability to do this are more likely to reproduce and therefore through evolution, our brain has​ become more and more complex.",0,0

And I am an athlete so there are plenty of times that I push my vessel to its limits to see what it’s breaking point is and how strong it actually is. And after seeing how strong it is I feel proud because after training it I made it stronger and more resistant to things. I never thought about it this way until now, but it makes sense. I tell it what to do and it does it. In return I keep it healthy and alive. Me and him are really good friends though, we understand each other.",0,0

ILDy6kYU-xQ,"Consciousness is a state of matter. The brain is in a state of matter which causes dendritic growth in a liquid crystal matrix. This dendritic growth controlled by the environment itself and the sum of our body inputs and thoughts and subconscious inputs. \\n\\nThis means that the 'body-mind' is an interface between two things, and the 'body-mind+environment' is another interface of 3 things. An interface between 2 humans, is an interface between 4 distinct things (body-mind-environment-body-mind). \\n\\nWe all share the 'Body of the environment with each other, so this is like the organism we compose, just as cells compose our bodies and share the body as their environment. \\n\\nDoes this preclude a non-material 'soul'? No! In fact it means that everything is part of your soul, because the interfaces are dissolved in various ways, including in death. The only possible way that science could explain a non-local consciousness with what we know about the Universe, is to organize the consciousness into a highly correlated quantum object that behaves like a superposition of all possible states the brain could take with it's slow physical matter. This highly correlated state could be considered a Bose-Einstein condensate or a superfluid. The sum total of the brain's capabilities could result in a quantum 'image' that can be stable and distributed across a holographic network in the environment by resonant entrainment of the quantum state of matter.  This can be done while ALIVE but it requires that the highly correlated 'body-mind' superposition delocalize itself just a bit so that it can be in two places at once. Both representing the physical activity of brain-states and interacting non-locally with the environments information/momentum content.\\n\\nYou can see evidence of this by looking the the double-slit experiments by physicist Dean Radin. \\n\\nIn those experiments the wave-particle duality of the experiments is influenced to collapse into particle behavior or expand into wave behavior depending on whether or not humans are watching (at any distance and through cameras even) because of our 'mind-body' creating a highly correlated 'sink' for quantum information. \\n\\nWhat if you have to prepare for death in order to be capable of navigating in a state where the body dies and leaves only the 'mind-environment' interface to store the previous information structure that the brain provided for the flow of information you think of as 'mind'. The highly correlated information can't disappear, it can be transformed but it won'y lose information through decoherence, but weakly correlated systems would become inaccessible to the 'mind' after death if there was trauma to the brain and decoherence was too strong before transmigration.",0,0

Human brains does all three, yet we have consciousness. Saying that we have souls is just another way to say that there is something beyond material science which describes what we are.

NJ2asQtT014,"POOR KYLIE! Sorry to say. But Kylie Jenner deserves to get pregnant from hotter guy instead of that doped Travis Scott that looks like a total retard. I'm not distinguishing what kinda race he is to another certain race 'cause I believe there are still many classy, hotter, fine, & educated black guys out there. So the conclusion is obvious that Kylie Jenner and some of her sisters have just been pursuing and haunting wealth from people who recklessly love to scatter dollars. No matter how ugly that person is. As long as they're royal on spending money, those slutty chicks will always approach such a person to date whatsoever. OK, If she indeed has a crush on black guys, can't she just date a guy that looks like Will Smith or John Legend who's genuinely gorgeous?... She's surely capable of alluring any man she wants.

BY3SLVNBkeo,"It was very easy to teach our cats to play with us directly and not damage us. As soon as they use their nails, stop, say ow! with a crying lilt in your voice,  and touch the paw that caused the problem. They learn very quickly. Now our cats even play rake (with their hind legs) our arms using only their pads when we tickle their belly. Same with biting: just stop moving (don't pull away) and say Ow!. Obviously it requires overriding your immediate response as well; pulling away from a claw or bite does more damage (to you) than just freezing. It makes play much more enjoyable for both of us rather than simply using a toy.",1,1
BY3SLVNBkeo,"I always have played with my cats using my hands to teach them to be gentle with their teeth and claws. I teach them to be gentle by giving them a command as soon as they bite or use their claws and even more better if you can catch it before it happens. Once i know the cat understands the command i slowly stop using the command until it becomes second nature to the cat not to bite down hard or use their claws on humans.Reason why i do this is sometimes even thou you may watch them very carefully around kids, accidents do happen. So i've taught every cat i have owned to be gentle. If you do not introduce them to be gentle with hands, they will not learn how to be gentle when kids or stranger hands touching them.  \\n\\nAlso i suggest to put away any string or fishing rod toy that dangles in the air or any small toys when you can not watch your cat. Fishing toys can be dangerous too. I had one experience with my cat who love fishing toys. One day i was holding her fishing rod toy it in the air. She jump down from her cat tree running full speed and jump for the fishing toy and the rope accidentally wrapped around her front leg. I am glad when i felt the tug in my hand i let go. I could see her licking her front leg and shoulder blade for couple of minutes and shaking her front leg. I brought her to the vet just in case. Vet said nothing too serious with her leg. Probably just a slight pull but nothing to be concern about. However since that incident she never wants to play with any type of fishing rod toy, she runs away from that toy now.",2,1

ILDy6kYU-xQ,"It doesn't seem such a difficult question to me. Given the correct environment our brain should be able to exit with consciousness intact. I imagine it would have to be a very confusing, abstract experience with no outside stimulation whatsoever. I would think the parts of the brain that receive, process and react to stimuli would either become overactive or degrade, possibility both over time. The question would be how much awareness or consciousness relies on the outside stimulation. Would a mind separated from all else imagine the world because of a continued awareness of it or would it's awareness be completely confined to itself? Would the world cease to exit to the mind? Would any change be due to down regulation of function in unused areas of the brain or a psychological reaction to being completely cut off from the world? Would there be changes in the still operational parts of the brain, increased activity or even growth? Would the brain eventually stop functioning completely?",0,0
ILDy6kYU-xQ,"Think of a wireless monitor.  That is, a monitor connected to the CPU wirelessly.  Now let's say we stick some cavemen into a some place full of wireless monitors.  Eventually they might figure out that when they click on the keyboard stuff appears on the screen.  They might also try doing arithmetic and see that the computer prints the right answers.  Obviously, they don't know it's wireless or even of the concept of wireless so they'll assume that the monitor is doing everything by itself.  They might then experiment with it and see that when they cut one wire, the keyboard doesn't work.  Cut another and the screen turns off and so on.  They might get to the point where they pretty much know how it works and can even repair damaged monitors.  But they have no idea that the monitor is only the output and input system with a hidden CPU doing everything behind the scenes.\\n\\nThat's from the game 999 and was used for something else but it has some interesting implications when applied to this.  What if our brain is that wireless monitor?  Our brain isn't doing anything, it's just taking in information, giving it to some invisible entity, and then displays everything through the body.  Everything we know about the brain with chemicals and electric signals might just be how it outputs and inputs information, not necessarily how it's dealing with it because something else is in charge of that.

ILDy6kYU-xQ,"(Before u read this, u should know I'm coming from a very atheistic point of view. So if u love Geezus or any other god, u probably shouldn't read this or u might get triggered.) On one hand, we are absolutely insignificant in the cosmic scale. Physically we are minute when compared to the billions of planets, stars, and galaxies in the universe. Our bodies are extremely fragile and could've only came to be through perfect circumstance. Our minds can be easily tricked and because of our senses, we never really see our world how it truly is. Be that as it may, we are literally the eyes of the Universe looking back on itself. Through the right evolutionary processes, we have come to be on this little space rock we call home. We can see and hear the world around us. We can attempt to understand it through scientific means and learn new things everyday. We can connect with each other and feel beautiful emotions like happiness, contentment, and love. Even though these are creations of our minds, they are still very real to us. I feel very special yet humbled by these thoughts. We should appreciate and enjoy life. We should love and help one another. We should value life but always keep in mind that when we're all gone, our energy will just flow on.",0,0

I'm not distinguishing what kinda race he is to another certain race 'cause I believe there are still many classy, hotter, fine, & educated black guys out there. So the conclusion is obvious that Kylie Jenner and some of her sisters have just been pursuing and haunting wealth from people who recklessly love to scatter dollars. No matter how ugly that person is. As long as they're royal on spending money, those slutty chicks will always approach such a person to date whatsoever. OK, If she indeed has a crush on black guys, can't she just date a guy that looks like Will Smith or John Legend who's genuinely gorgeous?... She's surely capable of alluring any man she wants.

8kpD3XCp49o,"The iPhone X is going to have the same results.  iPhones are basically Snapchat and Emoji devices for loose teenage girls.  The Note 8 is a beast and destroys any iPhone.  Apple is scamming all you iFruits. You're just paying for the Apple logo. You gotta pay damn near $80 extra for fast charging. The Apple watch still has a lame square design, and features that Samsung Gear watches been had.  iOS11 is trash, same bullshit row of icons and restrictions.  WTF is Super Retina?  What's next, Super Duper Retina?   WTF is so Bionic about the A11 chip?  It's obviously not Bionic enough to go against the Note 8.  And AR is just plain silly, you have to pan the screen around like an idiot to use it.  VR is much more immersive, and Samsung has the best mobile VR.  The only thing iOS has going for it is iMessage, but without iMessage the iPhone is 100% a child's toy.  The worst thing about the iPhone is the constant replacement of lighting cables, which have the highest failure rate.  Even the iPhone 7 plus has garbage on screen battery life. The last decent iPhone was the 6S Plus, the greatest iPhone was the 4S. Oh yea, that new portrait lighting feature is complete garbage, straight amatuer shit.",1,0

8kpD3XCp49o,These tests are pretty pathetic.  I mean who in their right mind opens and closes apps over and over.  Also these tests are irrelevant because iOS is a different OS compared to Android with entirely different design.  Its comparing a car to a truck.  Both are phones and do their job well.  What I would like to see is something non apple and non android and less samsung and apple hype.,1,0

8kpD3XCp49o,I m not a fan of either systems...but I think the tests you use to do were like repeating all the apps in the same manner in step two........in this you have reversed it in step two.....if this is the case then you have to test the previous models again....may be you will find different results....and also you have to do to the test again with these two in the similar manner for step two.......again may be you will find different results.,0,0
8kpD3XCp49o,Looks like all those articles saying the iPhone is the fastest phone ever because of the *benchmarks* owe it to their readers to bring actual evidence like this to compare speed. \nHm.,0,0
8kpD3XCp49o,"This is super misleading.  The test did not take into account the fact that the app switching animation in iOS is longer than that in Android (which is certainly true, it's Apple's design choice to make things look good and smooth whether you like it or not!).  You opened and closed 16 apps twice, making a total of 64 times of app switching animation.  This likely dominates the final results far more than any difference in the performance/speed of these two devices.  A difference of 0.1s in app switching animation will result in an addition of 6 seconds in the final results of this test so this is certainly the deciding factor.\\n\\nTo make my point clearer, I can theoretically have a phone with no app switching animation at all and it will crush these two devices in this test even though the actual performance is way poorer.  This kind of test is only valid for devices with the same OS where the animation is identical.",1,0

I enjoyed her, I love her dearly, caring for her was wonderful, but at the same time I was depressed and I hated my life at times. So many things changed and it traumatized me. My furbabies are gone and I became THAT parent who had to rehome them for their benefit. My husband and I vented to each other, and we got closer,  but we also fought. My two month maternity leave was hell, and she came six weeks early so I was not fully prepared. I can't imagine life without her, and she is now almost 11 months, but I am so traumatized I blocked out those few months.

K20YGjVkZRw,"I had a very easy recovery after the birth body wise, but I had PPD and with the changes going on when my baby was born..I hated her newborn phase. I enjoyed her, I love her dearly, caring for her was wonderful, but at the same time I was depressed and I hated my life at times. So many things changed and it traumatized me. My furbabies are gone and I became THAT parent who had to rehome them for their benefit. My husband and I vented to each other, and we got closer,  but we also fought. My two month maternity leave was hell, and she came six weeks early so I was not fully prepared. I can't imagine life without her, and she is now almost 11 months, but I am so traumatized I blocked out those few months. It's not all rainbows when a baby comes into the world, so thank you for being honest with these videos to show people the truth.",1,0

K20YGjVkZRw,"Its nice to hear the father's side, you don't get to hear it often. For those of us who were first time moms and had to learn alone about newborn babies and Google was your only back up lol well I understand you but believe when I tell you that you'll appreciate your baby so much more because you were both getting to know each other.   I can only say from personal experience, in those times of frustration and tiredness I held on to God and he helped me through it all. Now my baby is almost 4 months and I'm so excited to see what the future has instore for us. The key to being a good mother and a good partner is patience and wisdom and above all be open to suggestions from people who have been through it.",2,0

I mean, those guys are driving what you'd pick up at Alamo as a rental in 1985.  They outrun him.  I remember howling at the screen, as Stallone flails.   He struggles to keep up.  And then he crashes.  They escape.  In their Dodge Aspen. That's the chase.  Some action hero.  Cobra?  Hah.  More like...um...Slow-bra.",0,0

S_DltnHeJ-M,Doesn't it suck not being good at processing emotion. To day someone told me the reason a helicopter had been hovering over my village was because some girl got drunk and tried to commit suicide by jumping into the harbour and my response is an awkward smile and saying well that was a great idea in a sarcastic tone....what is wrong with me. And when people tell me a problems all i can suggest is tea. And when I sign cards I can only think of really generic things to say because i'm really bad at sentimentality.

K20YGjVkZRw,"I had a very easy recovery after the birth body wise, but I had PPD and with the changes going on when my baby was born..I hated her newborn phase. I enjoyed her, I love her dearly, caring for her was wonderful, but at the same time I was depressed and I hated my life at times. So many things changed and it traumatized me. My furbabies are gone and I became THAT parent who had to rehome them for their benefit. My husband and I vented to each other, and we got closer,  but we also fought. My two month maternity leave was hell, and she came six weeks early so I was not fully prepared. I can't imagine life without her, and she is now almost 11 months, but I am so traumatized I blocked out those few months. It's not all rainbows when a baby comes into the world, so thank you for being honest with these videos to show people the truth.",1,0

K20YGjVkZRw,Ben is such a sweet considerate husband😭😍 Its so true! you always hear the moms side of the story but truthfully its hard for both side. Im currently pregnant with my 2nd child and this time around i could feel how heavy my husband's shoulders are trying to take of the family in every aspects. Big thumbs up to dads out there too! They got alot of responsibility too! I also heard dads can grt post-partum depression too. love your  mommyhood videos!! ♥️,1,0
K20YGjVkZRw,"Its nice to hear the father's side, you don't get to hear it often. For those of us who were first time moms and had to learn alone about newborn babies and Google was your only back up lol well I understand you but believe when I tell you that you'll appreciate your baby so much more because you were both getting to know each other.   I can only say from personal experience, in those times of frustration and tiredness I held on to God and he helped me through it all. Now my baby is almost 4 months and I'm so excited to see what the future has instore for us. The key to being a good mother and a good partner is patience and wisdom and above all be open to suggestions from people who have been through it.",2,0
K20YGjVkZRw,"Hi Jen, you and Ben mention that you're almost always doing everything together. Sometimes I feel guilty for seeming to be so clingy or being seen together too often. Would LOVE to hear / see more often about your relationship with Ben, how you two built such relationship, and also was there any initial challenges that you two met, given that you're in a relationship with someone from a different race. \\nLove, Linda",0,0

8RlChzDl1Tw,"I was so disappointed in the fact they used Christine and Elijah. I find them completely not entertaining. They're just too much, to a point where they just aren't funny. This was painful. Also, it seemed as though half way through the film, the storyline went out into left field. Bummer. I do look forward to seeing what they come out with in the future, Julien and Collin are wonderful and are so creative. I know they are capable of so much more.",3,0
8RlChzDl1Tw,"I hate to agree with most of these comments but I think this is missing something. I think the idea of have kind of a documentary of sort about a weird clay animator is a good base, but this was kind of all over the place and just generally unfunny. & I really love Julien and Christine and I love the editing style and all but it just was over all meh.

8RlChzDl1Tw,"JULIEN I LOVE THIS. I found this to be really entertaining and HILARIOUS. The main character has an obsession and we can see that by the way she freaks out over her clay missing showing that she's weird but then she hits someone with her car and we realize that she's actually SOMEBODY because that person loves her and recognizes her talent.Also,  People love her art and she's being paid for it. I got 2 messages from the Video 1) the weirdest things can still be loved by others and even obsessed over when you might think it's totally useless and pointless or 2) weird things that are meaningless are getting attention and therefore becoming something THE DUDE AT THE END LITERALLY SAYS ANYTHING CAN BE ANYTHING. So, this *gestures at the video* can be anything, even the most pointless video or the most interesting video. I think this is amazing please do more stuff like this or just keep filming. It makes me sad that most of the comments are people complaining about how sucky it is and confusing when it is literally quite simple.",0,0

Art is about the emotion it illicits and the impact it has on you. It doesn't matter if you liked this story or not, it is about how it makes you think about things. Not saying there isn't room for improvement, but this deserves a lot more credit than I think it's been getting in this audience. Maybe it isn't the right type of content for youtube, but as long as it is important to the creators, it should be recognized here. Keep up the good work Waffsicle!",0,0

8RlChzDl1Tw,I thought this was incredible. It was so different from the loud and in-your-face comedy Elijah and Christine are typically associated with.

8RlChzDl1Tw,"I'm a huge fan of your work Julien, so I'll give my honest feedback. Editing, fantastic. Shot beautifully. Story was good but could have been simplified a bit for the length of the film, or it should have been a bit longer, like 12 mins. The acting from Elijah was great, the rest of the performances I wouldn't rate. For me the writing was a bit stilted. Overall though, I really enjoyed it.",0,0
8RlChzDl1Tw,"I'm confused like most people here, but I also loved the cinematography and the video like most people here. Julien & Collin together will probably take all the constructive criticism from the comments and create even more dope videos in the future so for that I'm very excited.",0,0

8RlChzDl1Tw,I loved it until about 2:40. I found Elijah's character didn't seem to really fit in with Christine's; it just seemed like an odd combo.

K20YGjVkZRw,"I had a very easy recovery after the birth body wise, but I had PPD and with the changes going on when my baby was born..I hated her newborn phase. I enjoyed her, I love her dearly, caring for her was wonderful, but at the same time I was depressed and I hated my life at times. So many things changed and it traumatized me. My furbabies are gone and I became THAT parent who had to rehome them for their benefit. My husband and I vented to each other, and we got closer,  but we also fought. My two month maternity leave was hell, and she came six weeks early so I was not fully prepared. I can't imagine life without her, and she is now almost 11 months, but I am so traumatized I blocked out those few months.

K20YGjVkZRw,Ben is such a sweet considerate husband😭😍 Its so true! you always hear the moms side of the story but truthfully its hard for both side. Im currently pregnant with my 2nd child and this time around i could feel how heavy my husband's shoulders are trying to take of the family in every aspects. Big thumbs up to dads out there too! They got alot of responsibility too! I also heard dads can grt post-partum depression too. love your  mommyhood videos!! ♥️,1,0
K20YGjVkZRw,"Its nice to hear the father's side, you don't get to hear it often. For those of us who were first time moms and had to learn alone about newborn babies and Google was your only back up lol well I understand you but believe when I tell you that you'll appreciate your baby so much more because you were both getting to know each other.   I can only say from personal experience, in those times of frustration and tiredness I held on to God and he helped me through it all. Now my baby is almost 4 months and I'm so excited to see what the future has instore for us. The key to being a good mother and a good partner is patience and wisdom and above all be open to suggestions from people who have been through it.",2,0

8RlChzDl1Tw,"Ok. A self-taught, self-proclaimed movie critic here. The movie is all over the place. I got an impression this was going to be a documentary type of film, a biography to be specific. Not even a minute in it got me confused. It switches to being a comedy but I am not sure what exactly it's making fun of. Clay artists? Artists in general? Art? Autistic people? Fat people? Cannot tell. Probably because it's neither, and, like I said in the beginning, it's all over the place. What is author trying to say by putting an Obama shirt on the main character? What's Judy's background? Who is she? The movie doesn't say enough and leaves you wondering about too many things. There is no story, just random moments in some people's lives, which we don't know enough of to decide whether it's a common day for them or is it something different? Is Judy always this dramatic? What happens to her fan? Are all of her fans like that? So many questions and so little answers. There is gotta be a part 2.",0,0

8RlChzDl1Tw,"I believe this documentary style short film represents Collin's and Julien's own passion for video making. You can see it reflects their style. I personally enjoyed the short film, it's not supposed to be a comedy kit, it's supposed to be taken seriously like a real documentary but then again you can't take it seriously because certain parts are humorous therefore it's a parody. There's no extensive plot because what's suppose to be taken from the video is the message not the experience of taking the viewer through a real plot, although the viewer gets to experience Judy's passion. The message clearly is a person's passion for doing something, in this case it's Judy's passion for clay.\\n\\nI do believe it could have been written better because many people were left confused meaning you did not successfully deliver your content/purpose.",0,0

I don't want to beg for subs, but I think I have to in order to get the ball rolling for my channel. I make weekly how to videos and if you can check it out that would make my day. The quality is terrible right now, but I found out a way to change that. I rushed to get videos out in the beginning and that was a huge mistake because the quality is pretty shabby. A short glance at my channel would be really awesome, but a sub is always treasured. I'll try to sub back but it's not guaranteed. Thank you guys for reading this!!!

I have grown up watching this channel, and I’m sure many other people here have as well. I personally believe that Ryan is irreplaceable on YouTube, and that when he finally does decide to “hang em up”, it will be a very sad day.

E6eRA8PnuW4,"Your one little complaint reminds me a lot of Arrival honestly. It was a great movie and all, but there were frustrating moments where they didn't expect the audience to figure things out on their own and annoyingly spelled it out more than necessary.\\n\\nSPOILERS FOR ARRIVAL\\n\\nThey did such an amazing job of letting all the pieces fall into place without the need for explanation, but then obnoxiously explain it anyway. When she calls out who is this child? it immediately hits you, oh fuck, those weren't flashbacks at all, the child in all those visions she's been having isn't actually born yet. They of course felt the need to spell that out immediately after by having the alien just flat out say you see the future now lmao.\\n\\nWhat frustrated me more though was that they show her making the decision to have a baby and that was enough to make all the drama in these flashbacks make sense. It's well established that whoever the father is of the child, she made some decision that enraged him and he left. Then we learn that Hawkeye is the father and the child came AFTER all the events of the movie, meaning after having all those visions of the kid on their deathbed. She obviously knew and willingly inflicted that grief on them anyway. It feels nice and subtle and has a lot of punch. But then of course...\\n\\nMommy why did daddy leave?\\nWELL HONEY IT HAS SOMETHING TO DO WITH THIS DISEASE THAT IS VERY DEADLY AND CAN'T BE CURED, WINK WINK",0,0

There will be no more pain or suffering. In fact, God Himself will wipe all tears from our eyes. \\n\\nSo please, if you don't know Jesus, call upon Him today. Repent of your sins and put your faith in Jesus Christ. He loves you, my friends. He is not angry at you, although the devil will have you to believe that He is. This is not true, because Jesus is waiting on you to call upon Him in Truth. \\n\\nHe is not a God who forces Himself on you, He is a God that respects your decision, but He has shown us that each decision we make has consequences. \\n\\nSo make the greatest decision of your life and make Jesus your Lord and Savior. You will be forgiven, you will be delivered, you will be set free. \\n\\nTrust in His Love. \\n\\nI pray you consider calling out to Jesus, because to die without The Lord is a very dangerous thing - there is a major consequence to it. \\n\\nShalom, friends.",0,0

xGqMGGn3Sko,"Picture that, a man guest speaking at an event honoring women, we truly have come a very long way as a country👏👏. When are americans gna wake up to the fact that U ARE NOT OPPRESSED?  The progressive liberal democrats literally have no message, nor a track record to campaign on, so they do what they do best to take the attention off of the parties true history of oppression as slave owners AND straight up oppressors of ANYONE who was not an inner circle rich lord as most of them were. So they do what they do best and create this victim hood club, if ur a women ,if ur black,if ur a tranny,if ur brown,yellow,muslim,etc etc well as long as ur a democrat vote AND ur weak minded enough to fall for their identity politics u r invited & will be received with open arms. BUT if ur black,brown,gay,muslim etc and do not fall in line and parrot ppl like clinton,obama,michelle obama etc well then U are the evil racist bigot no matter ur gender or identity and they will stop at nothing to silence u. Case in point look at milo yeonopolus  , hes a gay immigrant sho dates black men, BUT he does not fall in line with the left, points out that THEY were literally the founders of the kkk,jim crow, segragation,anti womens rights,anti civil rights etc and whats the first thing they brand him as? A homophobic ,racist,bigot??? Go figure.\\nNevermind the fact that he's a gay, immigrant who dates black men bc THAT does NOT help push  the democrat victimization mentality now does it?\\nLemme ask any liberal democrats that actually read this far something, \\nCan u look up what elected  party runs EVERY INNER CITY ACROSS AMERICA with the highest crime rates, poverty, lowest grades,lowest incomes,most ghettos or (low income housing aka projects) ,lowest employment rates , highest black on black murders etc etc? I promise u this is what u will find, EVERY city like chicago,baltimore,ny,philly,Michigan etc is owned & operated by the democrat party & ppl just like the clintons & obamas. The ppl there ARE NOTHING MORE THAN VOTES AND INCOME GENERATORS AND THEY DO NOT WANT U OR UR PPL DOING BETTER bc the worst off u are the more they can point to the conservatives of this country & say its there fault and keep u on that democrat plantation. Good luck, i truly hope u wake up cause u & ur ppl do deserve a whole lot better.",0,0

8PDnSzf_TV8,"I've had a Chromebook for a year, and I'll be selling it soon. I've had it for some academic work, and it has proven great for that. I like having docs and my drive all easily accessible, but I often find myself frustrated with simple issues. I have a more powerful Chromebook, with decent RAM and a good processor, yet many tasks it can sometimes struggle with.\\n\\nI miss being simply able to open certain files on Windows. I will be selling my Chromebook, because even with Android Apps, it is not good enough. They are cheap, and if you need something simply to browse the web... get a Chromebook. But if you need anything more, forget it. This Pixelbook, as nice as it is, is too expensive for the lack of functionality.",0,0

TH2QRvu97NI,"I recently purchased the rubber face mask from selfriges, they retail at £10 each and you only get one mask inside which is hire expensive.

You cleanse your face and then apply the scream stuff all over your face, there’s a lot inside and you do have some left over, smells like lemons. Then you apply the rubber mask. I left it on for 40 minutes before I went to bed. And I loved it. My face was cold and I felt my face was soft and plump.i think when I wake up in the Leigh and wash my face wash if the rest of the cream my skin will be super soft. Although the mask is expensive I think you can actually use the same rubber mask again if your careful. Keep the bag it comes in, take of the rubber mask carefully and put back into the originally mask back and leave in fridge. I love how cool and cold it feels on your face. I think it can help with puffiness under the eyes and dark circles. I think it was brilliant... I hope you guys like it and enjoy it as much as I did.",0,0

I don't buy a phone just because it looks like something else, which is iPhone design in this case, I buy phones only when there are unique things that really makes me bond, just like how you would love a long-term crush.

It has a great keyboard and screen (3200x1800 snazzy) and if you're the sort of person, like many, who really does a great deal of writing in various forms on your computer, then it makes gobs of sense. The point you make about how useful android apps are is so true. Big issue for me is running applications that are staples on Mac or Windows, for me that means One Note for example, and being constrained to a web version on the Chromebook. Mine runs an i5 with 8gb of Ram, but the web experience of such Office is just...not.

But you trying to act as if blacks aren’t a minority and should feel like we aren’t because why we still get slave movies, we still are type cast, the same goes on. We are actually making history. The reason why people are angry at him because whenever black people show our style and culture people fear us down and call us thug and turn there noses at us like we are criminals and that we are generalized to be wrong like you just did, but when someone else takes what we have they are edgy and invented something fresh and made a new style.

Jeremy is spot on with his analysis but the fact that it keeps being an issue when it shouldn't be just goes to show that they're trying to create controversy for ratings. Jeremy is handling it like a better than pro. Like someone who doesn't give a fuck. I was a casual linsanity fan before but I truly appreciate how he's been handling this. It's a complicated situation and he's handling it like a pro,1,1

But you trying to act as if blacks aren’t a minority and should feel like we aren’t because why we still get slave movies, we still are type cast, the same goes on. We are actually making history. The reason why people are angry at him because whenever black people show our style and culture people fear us down and call us thug and turn there noses at us like we are criminals and that we are generalized to be wrong like you just did, but when someone else takes what we have they are edgy and invented something fresh and made a new style.

We are both still not starring in our own roles and not breaking the stereotypes. But you just used this video to bash black people so fuck you. Hair is hair it’s not a big deal that he has dreds, and it shouldn’t be. But you trying to act as if blacks aren’t a minority and should feel like we aren’t because why we still get slave movies, we still are type cast, the same goes on. We are actually making history. The reason why people are angry at him because whenever black people show our style and culture people fear us down and call us thug and turn there noses at us like we are criminals and that we are generalized to be wrong like you just did, but when someone else takes what we have they are edgy and invented something fresh and made a new style. We had a black president so obviously we have lots of blacks who are educated but our representation is so stereotypical you wouldn’t know about it, why do you think that is.

iv1zeGSvhIw,"Ah thought they had lost the first stage there for a minute would have been there first failure is a while when it was starting to look like they may have got landing the first stage down pat, they return 69 on them and they will have a better return success rate than the space shuttle, if we cut off the earlier failures which I would because the Falcon 9 is a refined rocket compared to the original Falcon 9, it's not the same machine really.\\n\\nAlthough having a better track record than the space shuttle is not exactly a compliment, I would like to see the Falcon 9 get to a 100,000 consecutive successful missions without a failure which was the original rating for the space shuttle... which was a bit off. But it probably wont reach that even if it never fails again because BFR should eventually be able to take over for it expect for when you need a launch window which BFR will not be ready for, because I assume that a BFR will be in maintenance for at least 6 months between maybe 5 launches and landings so if you have a fleet of 5 for example that would only give you 50 launches per year so if you need a specific launch window you will probably be shit out of luck, which is why you will still need a few Falcon 9's and Falcon Heavys laying around even if/when BFR has demonstrated it's reliability.\\n\\nUnless they are going to have a fleet of 37 BFR's to cover every day of the year, and building and maintaining 4-5 BFR's is already ambitious.",0,0
iv1zeGSvhIw,"Its weird that Tesla cars actually accelerate faster, if you compare them side by side. The rocket just keeps going.

iv1zeGSvhIw,***NEED AN ANSWER: *** so when the stage 2 rocket is activated the traveling speed starts to go up quickly as there is few friction in the atmosphere at 300km altitude. At minute 42:02 immediately the speed stops to 35'262 km/h and then starts going back. How this? An object launched at so high speed how can instantly stop?????!!!

And Cracked already gave a nuanced take on Benedict Arnold.  I mean, we were warned: this video WAS a standard middle school presentation of US history.  However, one of the reasons war statues are popular, why Ken Burns makes a Vietnam documentary telling Americans we had the best intentions, why the Smithsonian cannot have an honest display about the atomic bombings of civilian populations in WW2, why the New York Times calls John McCain a war hero (often) is to promote the martial virtues that sustain a permanent war economy, surveillance state, and empire. ...

nZtpLKCoUWg,"welcome to Cracked as our Former History teacher colleague carefully glances over and omits facts while trying to inform about other facts on the same topic.\\n\\nLets Talk about that pesky Legal Ruling that he glanced over, In 1654 It was time for Anthony Johnson a former indentured servant then semi wealthy African American farmer, to release John Casor his indentured servant and also African American. Instead Anthony told Casor he was extending his time past the agreed upon contracted time. Upset by this Casor left and became employed by Robert Parker(Caucasian(adding this little bit because it makes the ruling all the more baffling in context with the video since it's trying to describe it all as extremely racist).\\n\\nUpset by this Anthony Johnson sued Robert Parker in the north hampton court in 1654, the court ruled that Anthony Johnson could hold John Casor Indefinitely. The court also gave the judicial sanction for African americans to own a slave of their own race. thus John Casor became the first Permanent slave in the united states and Anthony Johnson the first Slave owner.\\n\\nleaving out that bit gives the video that it was all completely racist and that one race had no real part in it while another held all the parts.\\n\\nNow lets talk about Robert E. Lee, while I cannot speak for the rest of the confederates I can speak for lee because quite frankly while he's racist by our standards in his time he was fairly moderate. See Robert E. Lee didn't really have much time to spend at his home running things the original owner for all his slaves before he himself received them was his brother, Lee himself was sort of a supply officer/engineer for the army before the civil war he helped map quite a few states and the entirety of Florida, he also fought by Grant's side in the Mexican American war, he was highly respected, so when the civil war first started he was offered to be the leading general in the union, he decided to support his state because that's where his family and friends were this much we know because it's extremely well documented and there's letters detailing as such. now before that his brother had died, lee being a military man really couldn't trust people who had got captured and allowed for themselves to be put into such a position. that unfortunately he was rather unforgiving towards his slaves, especially after they had staged an uprising(surprise surprise history teacher left that out), after which he beat them in the context of the video then locked them up and sold them away (again he really didn't want anything to do with them to begin with.) because he really didn't want that happening again while he was away and once again endangering his family. skip through the 3 extremely well documented years of the civil war (yes we give all of this hate and vitriol to this man because of 3 years. US has been involved in the war on terror for what 17-18 years? context much?) so after the Civil war he takes up an administrative position at a college, puts the kibosh on acts of racial violence on campus, establishes some of the first state funded public schools that African americans can attend to better their position in life, stops a second civil war from happening and albeit in a somewhat racist and misguided way by today's standards tries to raise money to get African americans sent back to Africa oh and he was the first to get pardoned and reinstated as a citizen of the united states.\\n\\nyou can say he's a traitor all you want and say tear down his statues but the fact is you had a pardoned man who was forgiven spend the last five years of his left atoning for the previous three prior. I can't hate the man especially when I look at it in the context of the time he was in. Nor can I hate his Kin which to let you know are unfairly hated upon by both sides because on one side you have people who hate them for being related to Lee, and on the Other you have the being hated because they are Mixed. \\n\\nDo you know how difficult it is to stay silent while you have a friend who is proud of his heritage, admits their were mistakes but was fundamentally sees that three years of bad don't deserve over 100 years of hate especially if good had followed it, only to have that friend shirk down and go quiet during lunch because you have people like mr. history teacher continuing to down play certain things, or people who say  anyone related to a confederate needs to be punched.\\n\\nnext time you give a history lesson do it fucking right rather then doing the very thing you accuse others of.",1,0

Slaves back then noone gave a shit about, only the south really cared and made it one of their main sources for propaganda to their soldiers, like The North wish to take away our money, homes, and way of living (This included owning slaves) but the Confederates fought to protect their homes from what they thought to be greedy imperialists wanting to take their land and all who enhabit it.

I know what I expect as a reader in the 80s and I hope Fox maintains some level of continuity. Logan was done reasonably well and, while they actually ahd minimal interaction, Deadpool was amazing. But...then I reflect on those other movies such as X-men, Xmen Apocalypse...and I have to say that Fox has had minimal luck, as it's own entity, with bringing Super Heroes to the screen.

iv1zeGSvhIw,"Ah thought they had lost the first stage there for a minute would have been there first failure is a while when it was starting to look like they may have got landing the first stage down pat, they return 69 on them and they will have a better return success rate than the space shuttle, if we cut off the earlier failures which I would because the Falcon 9 is a refined rocket compared to the original Falcon 9, it's not the same machine really.\\n\\nAlthough having a better track record than the space shuttle is not exactly a compliment, I would like to see the Falcon 9 get to a 100,000 consecutive successful missions without a failure which was the original rating for the space shuttle... which was a bit off. But it probably wont reach that even if it never fails again because BFR should eventually be able to take over for it expect for when you need a launch window which BFR will not be ready for, because I assume that a BFR will be in maintenance for at least 6 months between maybe 5 launches and landings so if you have a fleet of 5 for example that would only give you 50 launches per year so if you need a specific launch window you will probably be shit out of luck, which is why you will still need a few Falcon 9's and Falcon Heavys laying around even if/when BFR has demonstrated it's reliability.\\n\\nUnless they are going to have a fleet of 37 BFR's to cover every day of the year, and building and maintaining 4-5 BFR's is already ambitious.",0,0

General William Mahone was the great military leader of the Confederacy. He did not agree with Lee at Gettysburg, but carried out the orders as he was supposed to do. Mahone became vilified as a race traitor for his Readjuster Party. A black-majority party, the Readjusters legitimated and promoted African American citizenship and political power by supporting black suffrage, office-holding, and jury service. To a degree previously unseen in Virginia, and unmatched anywhere else in the nineteenth-century South, the Readjusters became an institutional force for the protection and advancement of black rights and interests.\\n\\nAnd Lee was an extremely cruel slave owners.

nZtpLKCoUWg,"One myth that isn't brought up as a myth is the idea of Northerners being opposed to slavery because they were abolitionists and anti-racist. This isn't true at all. The North was plenty racist. \\n\\nOregon, for instance, had it written into its state constitution that blacks couldn't establish permanent residence in the state up until 1929, despite slavery being outlawed. The New York Draft Riots resulted in the murder and lynching of 11 black men. Blacks not lynched were straight-up chased out of New York after their neighborhoods were burned to the ground. While California was a Union State during the war, many Californians went to Texas to fight on behalf of the Confederacy. \\n\\nMake no mistake, the Union States had no problems with slavery as an institution establishing a racial hierarchy of white supremacy. The myth is the Union was abolitionist for moral reasons. The truth is the Union was opposed to slavery for economic reasons. \\n\\nHad slavery been allowed to expand to New England, U.S. Territories,  or the newly formed states of Oregon, Nevada (who became a state in 1864...part way through the war), and California, whites would have to compete with slave owners who used slaves to work in factories, mines, and plantations. Why worry about your factory workers going on strike when you can lock slaves inside and let them all die in a fire with zero fuss? Or worry about a mine collapsing? \\n\\nThe ugly truth is Union states don't want to recognize their role in creating racism in the United States. Their mistreatment of black Americans by Northerners got swept under the rug after the war was over and the 13th., 14th., and 15th. amendments were ratified.",0,0

nZtpLKCoUWg,"Quick context for this comment. I'm a half English, half African Jamaican who spent 4 years of my childhood in the 90's living in Ghana as the son of an incredibly wealthy contractor for the government. I also visited Zimbabwe and more recently, Egypt. While living in Ghana and as rich as our family was, I got malaria twice and both my siblings were infected with parasites on multiple occasions which were literally maggots growing under the surface of their skin. This happened whenever you didn't iron your laundry properly in order to burn out the eggs left by the local flies. There were all forms of wildlife everywhere (i.e. lizards and cockroaches in the house, scorpions in our boots, monkeys and bats in our backyard trees, the list goes on) and our tap water was potentially lethal (and that meant even ice had to be specially sourced if were hosting large parties). The government and police were truly oppressive (even when considering how relatively progressive they were for an African nation) to the extent that dissenters would regularly simply go missing and the bribing police was standard fare for avoiding the kind of beating that would make a pro-boxer blush. So, to summarise. Even being extraordinarily wealthy in a relatively decent African nation still doesn't protect you from Africa itself and even as one of the more developed African nations, Ghana in the 90's was extraordinarily oppressive when compared to any Western nation.\\n\\nWith all this in mind, I am sick to death of hearing African Americans romanticise the huge, diverse continent of Africa. I won't even tackle the ridiculous narrative that ran for years about all Africans somehow being Egyptian Kings (what in the fuck was that about?). For sure, Ghana and Zimbabwe are incredible and have to be seen to be truly appreciated, but African Americans are about as African as Trump is. I would have thought that considering how bad it is for African Americans in America what with all the oppression and murder, they'd have all decided to take their collective knowledge and wealth and ship themselves the fuck back to their true homes to help build African nations, but surprise surprise, they haven't. Even the most Afrocentric public figures in America haven't quite managed to find their way back to their homeland despite appropriating certain aspects of certain African cultures as it suits them (usually traditional clothing). \\n\\nBottom line, African Americans need to put up or shut up at this point. Either accept that you're Americans and stop whining about oppression (because it gets a lot worse in Africa, believe  me), or get yourselves back to your homeland and contribute to those societies. I'll add that I'm utterly baffled that in this day and age, African Americans still get really upset and angry whenever they hear a white person say nigger. The mere fact that African Americans born during or after the 80's let a 2 syllable, 6 letter word affect their mood in such extreme ways paints them as little more than whining cry babies. Get the fuck over it. Excuse the language.",0,0

nZtpLKCoUWg,"Abraham Lincoln, the great emancipator, only issued the Emancipation Proclamation to dissuade the French and British from joining the Confederate side and he only issued it after the Battle of Antietam which was a draw. The Emancipation Proclamation only freed slaves in the areas under confederate control which means slaves in the border states of Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia, and any part of the former south in the hands of the Union were exempt from the Emancipation Proclamation and were still in bondage until the 13 Amendment. As goes for the average confederate soldiers in the military, the northern soldiers felt the same too, they didn't want to fight a war where after they would had compete for jobs with the black men also. Many northern states before the war even issued laws prohibiting blacks from entering their state. Connecticut didn't want to teach blacks fearing that they would attract more to their states. Hey look I can pull quotes out too, to further my point! Abraham Lincoln, “I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races, 1859. and one last note I gotta agree with Lee on his quote, Africa is a shit hole place full of disease and no food.",0,2

This was after Dred Scott. Until his death he maintained that the Constitution provided no authority for the federal government to abolish slavery in the states where it already existed. \\n\\nWhich brings my last point, you contradicted yourself here. You even said in the opening that there was more to this than States rights and Slavery, yet you made it all about slavery. The people that went to war against the US were not committing treason. The fact is they had no other course of action. You see the laws of the country allowed for the ownership of slaves. Yes the west was to be free areas as you said but when debate broke down the north, acting against the laws of the times, started pushing to abolish slavery in slave states. Seeing an end to their way of life coming at them like a train, and with the northern states breaking the laws by helping run-a-ways and not returning escaped slaves , and those same states rallying against all slave ownership in direct violation of laws, what else could they do?

iv1zeGSvhIw,"Ah thought they had lost the first stage there for a minute would have been there first failure is a while when it was starting to look like they may have got landing the first stage down pat, they return 69 on them and they will have a better return success rate than the space shuttle, if we cut off the earlier failures which I would because the Falcon 9 is a refined rocket compared to the original Falcon 9, it's not the same machine really.\\n\\nAlthough having a better track record than the space shuttle is not exactly a compliment, I would like to see the Falcon 9 get to a 100,000 consecutive successful missions without a failure which was the original rating for the space shuttle... which was a bit off. But it probably wont reach that even if it never fails again because BFR should eventually be able to take over for it expect for when you need a launch window which BFR will not be ready for, because I assume that a BFR will be in maintenance for at least 6 months between maybe 5 launches and landings so if you have a fleet of 5 for example that would only give you 50 launches per year so if you need a specific launch window you will probably be shit out of luck, which is why you will still need a few Falcon 9's and Falcon Heavys laying around even if/when BFR has demonstrated it's reliability.\\n\\nUnless they are going to have a fleet of 37 BFR's to cover every day of the year, and building and maintaining 4-5 BFR's is already ambitious.",0,0

iv1zeGSvhIw,***NEED AN ANSWER: *** so when the stage 2 rocket is activated the traveling speed starts to go up quickly as there is few friction in the atmosphere at 300km altitude. At minute 42:02 immediately the speed stops to 35'262 km/h and then starts going back. How this? An object launched at so high speed how can instantly stop?????!!! Shouldn't have a continuos movement as there is no friction!?  Thanks to all for answer,0,7

nZtpLKCoUWg,"Dude...really?  I think there are some reasons you might have just been a middle school history teacher.  Lee's relationship to slavery was complex, but you're spreading myths.  His only slave ownership had to do with the settlement of the Custis estate, which you mention, but it's not like he acted against the instructions of the will out of spite.  The will stated that the slaves were to be liberated within two years.  Lee - somewhat understandably - reasoned that booting all those people out onto the market with nothing to their name and no real prospects would not be in their best interest, so he sought out somebody to help manage a more organized release.  The slaves - also understandably - were not necessarily eager to entertain the technical niceties of the instructions regarding disposition of the estate, however, and there were...problems.  Some of them ran away.\\n\\nThis left Lee in something of a pickle.  If he didn't punish them real hard, it would encourage all those other folks he needed to manage to pull the same thing, so he erred to the wrong side of the fence.  It's certainly not his proudest moment by a long shot, but it's not like he was rubbing himself through his pants while it happened.  More importantly, the magnitude and specifics of the event are pretty much lost to history.  We have good reason to believe it wasn't as bad as the worst assessments, because the worst assessments were offered by a bunch of people who couldn't get the details of their story straight to save their lives.  We know that it happened because there's other evidence pretty clearly indicating that it did.  The are between that, however?  Kind of impossible to navigate.   While the appeal to moderation is a fallacy, I'm not sure how else to approach a problem like this with history.\\n\\nRegarding his statements on the nature of slavery, you're also grabbing the wrong words.  The only universe in which American slaves would have been better off in Africa is one where Europe as a whole just didn't know it existed, and even then it's a dodgy proposition.  I mean, look at it now for chrissakes.  Things weren't better back then.  Slavery was a terrible goddamn way to get it, but those who were displaced did at least get access to the fruits of the industrial revolution and the relative increase in standard of living that came with the transition.  Life in Uganda was not chilling by a lake eating fruit - it was living in a hostile jungle full of things that wanted to kill you without access to even the half-assed medical wisdom of the time, plus whatever fuckery the local colonial power decided to get up to.  It does not constitute an endorsement of slavery to contend that at least the victims got SOMETHING out of the whole ordeal, much as it is not an endorsement of diabetes to observe that at least it keeps me from being a drunk and in relatively good shape.  Both still eat.\\n\\nHowever, the particularly weird statement that Lee DID make about slavery was that it was bad, but it hurt white people worse, and there was nothing people could do about it, so we had to wait for Jesus to drop a liberty bomb or some shit.  I'm not joking.  When I try to put myself in the headspace of the time, I can understand the fact that people were citizens of their states first and their nation second and were more likely to follow their states whether they agreed with the policies or not (ultimately the reason why Lee ended up generalling and whatnot).  I don't agree with that, but I get it.  What I cannot wrap my brain around, however, is how somebody can observe that something is a moral injustice that shouldn't exist and then vacate any capacity to do anything about it.  I just don't quite grasp that.  And never mind the shit about how awful slavery was for white folks.  I mean, he's not wrong in one sense - it's not exactly great for your general moral fiber and relationship to the world to own dudes - but contrasting that with being held in actual bondage and not figuring the slaves have it worse is kind of ludicrous.\\n\\nRegarding this treason charge, I'd be interested to know if you think all those Catalans who voted for independence committed treason?  Or all the Scottish people who got narrowly beaten out in that referendum?  The Civil War was done to settle a question without a real answer - who gets to decide when you're out of the family?  Does a state get to unilaterally decide to remove itself from the Union, or does the Union have to give it permission?  The Confederacy posited that the former was true.  They were allowed to leave the nation whenever they wanted, so they acted as such.  There wasn't really any other action they COULD take, given that belief.  If you think you're allowed to go, and then you say you're going, but the other guy says no you can't and holds the door shut, if you don't punch him in the nuts and go anyway you're kind of just going along with what he says in the first place - that he's the one who gets to tell you when you can go.  About the only thing anybody did in that whole sad mess that could be considered treasonous was the seizure of federal military assets by the Confederacy, which gets complicated and questionable.",0,0

And in General Lee's time it was a million times worse over there. I have a friend from Kenya - in his village at 13 the right of passage for boys was this you had to make your own spear and go out of the village and weren't allowed back until you hunted down and killed a male lion and dragged its carcass back to prove you were a man.

nZtpLKCoUWg,"Quick context for this comment. I'm a half English, half African Jamaican who spent 4 years of my childhood in the 90's living in Ghana as the son of an incredibly wealthy contractor for the government. I also visited Zimbabwe and more recently, Egypt. While living in Ghana and as rich as our family was, I got malaria twice and both my siblings were infected with parasites on multiple occasions which were literally maggots growing under the surface of their skin. This happened whenever you didn't iron your laundry properly in order to burn out the eggs left by the local flies. There were all forms of wildlife everywhere (i.e. lizards and cockroaches in the house, scorpions in our boots, monkeys and bats in our backyard trees, the list goes on) and our tap water was potentially lethal (and that meant even ice had to be specially sourced if were hosting large parties). The government and police were truly oppressive (even when considering how relatively progressive they were for an African nation) to the extent that dissenters would regularly simply go missing and the bribing police was standard fare for avoiding the kind of beating that would make a pro-boxer blush. So, to summarise. Even being extraordinarily wealthy in a relatively decent African nation still doesn't protect you from Africa itself and even as one of the more developed African nations, Ghana in the 90's was extraordinarily oppressive when compared to any Western nation.\\n\\nWith all this in mind, I am sick to death of hearing African Americans romanticise the huge, diverse continent of Africa. I won't even tackle the ridiculous narrative that ran for years about all Africans somehow being Egyptian Kings (what in the fuck was that about?). For sure, Ghana and Zimbabwe are incredible and have to be seen to be truly appreciated, but African Americans are about as African as Trump is. I would have thought that considering how bad it is for African Americans in America what with all the oppression and murder, they'd have all decided to take their collective knowledge and wealth and ship themselves the fuck back to their true homes to help build African nations, but surprise surprise, they haven't. Even the most Afrocentric public figures in America haven't quite managed to find their way back to their homeland despite appropriating certain aspects of certain African cultures as it suits them (usually traditional clothing). \\n\\nBottom line, African Americans need to put up or shut up at this point. Either accept that you're Americans and stop whining about oppression (because it gets a lot worse in Africa, believe  me), or get yourselves back to your homeland and contribute to those societies. I'll add that I'm utterly baffled that in this day and age, African Americans still get really upset and angry whenever they hear a white person say nigger. The mere fact that African Americans born during or after the 80's let a 2 syllable, 6 letter word affect their mood in such extreme ways paints them as little more than whining cry babies. Get the fuck over it. Excuse the language.",0,0

nZtpLKCoUWg,"Robert E. Lee was an average military leader. He should have won at Gettysburg, but his incompetence got in his way. \\n\\nAs just about everything we are told about the Civil War, the great military leader myth was created during the reconstruction. General William Mahone was the great military leader of the Confederacy. He did not agree with Lee at Gettysburg, but carried out the orders as he was supposed to do. Mahone became vilified as a race traitor for his Readjuster Party. A black-majority party, the Readjusters legitimated and promoted African American citizenship and political power by supporting black suffrage, office-holding, and jury service. To a degree previously unseen in Virginia, and unmatched anywhere else in the nineteenth-century South, the Readjusters became an institutional force for the protection and advancement of black rights and interests.\\n\\nAnd Lee was an extremely cruel slave owners. While slavery was never less than cruel, Jefferson et al were generally among the more humane slavers.\\n\\nThough Jefferson is not without blame. He is largely the reason the South remained backward and dependent on slavery, while the North innovated and developed technologies. The latter was Lincoln's America.",0,0

nZtpLKCoUWg,"One myth that isn't brought up as a myth is the idea of Northerners being opposed to slavery because they were abolitionists and anti-racist. This isn't true at all. The North was plenty racist. \\n\\nOregon, for instance, had it written into its state constitution that blacks couldn't establish permanent residence in the state up until 1929, despite slavery being outlawed. The New York Draft Riots resulted in the murder and lynching of 11 black men. Blacks not lynched were straight-up chased out of New York after their neighborhoods were burned to the ground. While California was a Union State during the war, many Californians went to Texas to fight on behalf of the Confederacy. \\n\\nMake no mistake, the Union States had no problems with slavery as an institution establishing a racial hierarchy of white supremacy. The myth is the Union was abolitionist for moral reasons. The truth is the Union was opposed to slavery for economic reasons. \\n\\nHad slavery been allowed to expand to New England, U.S. Territories,  or the newly formed states of Oregon, Nevada (who became a state in 1864...part way through the war), and California, whites would have to compete with slave owners who used slaves to work in factories, mines, and plantations. Why worry about your factory workers going on strike when you can lock slaves inside and let them all die in a fire with zero fuss? Or worry about a mine collapsing? \\n\\nThe ugly truth is Union states don't want to recognize their role in creating racism in the United States. Their mistreatment of black Americans by Northerners got swept under the rug after the war was over and the 13th., 14th., and 15th. amendments were ratified.",0,0

In the trent affair lincoln arrested Brittans southern negotiators and was threatened with invasion by a Brittan led coalition. Making the war about slavery detoured these powers and goated the south i to a position that could not be defended in the modern age.

Also it would come off as more impartially accurate if it was presented by either a foreigner or by a southerner who's past family died to uphold wrong views. As is it sounds like someone angry about the past and excited to  crush his opponents. He is very true with his description of the post civil war tragedy. However, he misses another great myth, the goodness of Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln used slavery to accomplish his political desires nothing more. Secondly if the Yankees (of whom I am) did not treat post civil war poor Southerners with such contempt for slavery the poor unemployed Southerners might not have ingrained in every son and daughter a love for what was supposedly taken and a distain for whom they feel took it (slaves). They were bored and had no real future so started the KKK, oddly enough African Americans Who were poor, bored, and had no real future tried the same thing in the 50s and 60s especially with groups like the black Panthers. Both groups made enemies out of their adversaries and sought to blame others instead of focusing on how to better their life now. Reminds me of the current movement to remove statues of conferate soldiers. Sidenote: He is objectivly  better off than those in Africa. That does not excuse the horrible wrongs of slavery.

nZtpLKCoUWg,"Abraham Lincoln, the great emancipator, only issued the Emancipation Proclamation to dissuade the French and British from joining the Confederate side and he only issued it after the Battle of Antietam which was a draw. The Emancipation Proclamation only freed slaves in the areas under confederate control which means slaves in the border states of Missouri, Kentucky, Maryland, Delaware, West Virginia, and any part of the former south in the hands of the Union were exempt from the Emancipation Proclamation and were still in bondage until the 13 Amendment. As goes for the average confederate soldiers in the military, the northern soldiers felt the same too, they didn't want to fight a war where after they would had compete for jobs with the black men also. Many northern states before the war even issued laws prohibiting blacks from entering their state. Connecticut didn't want to teach blacks fearing that they would attract more to their states. Hey look I can pull quotes out too, to further my point! Abraham Lincoln, “I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races, 1859. and one last note I gotta agree with Lee on his quote, Africa is a shit hole place full of disease and no food.",0,2
nZtpLKCoUWg,"You unfortunate truth has unfortunately left out some facts and twisted the narrative here. For one, yes lee said those things and beat his slave but he also freed all of his slaves in 1862. Some reports even tell of him assisting family members that were helping slaves return to Africa.\\n\\nAs for Honest Abe, you forgot to mention that he said, I believe there is no right, and ought to be no inclination in the people of the free States to enter into the slave States, and interfere with the question of slavery at all. This was after Dred Scott. Until his death he maintained that the Constitution provided no authority for the federal government to abolish slavery in the states where it already existed. \\n\\nWhich brings my last point, you contradicted yourself here. You even said in the opening that there was more to this than States rights and Slavery, yet you made it all about slavery. The people that went to war against the US were not committing treason. The fact is they had no other course of action. You see the laws of the country allowed for the ownership of slaves. Yes the west was to be free areas as you said but when debate broke down the north, acting against the laws of the times, started pushing to abolish slavery in slave states. Seeing an end to their way of life coming at them like a train, and with the northern states breaking the laws by helping run-a-ways and not returning escaped slaves , and those same states rallying against all slave ownership in direct violation of laws, what else could they do? The only option they had was to disband, which many say was their right, and fight for what they believed in.",0,2

nZtpLKCoUWg,"I only have one criticism. I happened to be interested in Robert E Lee, so I researched him and found out about the Custis slaves. I've read that there is both evidence for and against the story, or at least certain parts of it, but that could be misleading. Regardless, the point I want to make is that the will of Lee's father-in-law said this:\\n\\nAnd upon the legacies to my four granddaughters being paid, and my estates that are required to pay the said legacies, being clear of debts, then I give freedom to my slaves, the said slaves to be emancipated by my executors in such manner as to my executors may seem most expedient and proper, the said emancipation to be accomplished in not exceeding five years from the time of my decease.\\n\\nGeorge Custis(Lee's father-in-law) died in 1857. Robert E. Lee freed his slaves in 1862. Five years. While slavery is still a heinous crime, I do think it is worth mentioning that Robert E. Lee complied with the wishes of his father's will. As for the whipping story, I've seen everything from Lee himself never whipped any of them,  to he never washed their backs with brine, to he did all of those things.

R1ZXOOLMJ8s,"Christmas and the Winter solstice; \\nThe winter solstice is not about the rebirth of a god. Although the sun has been worshiped as God and many of these beliefs and traditions have been passed along to Christianity. The winter solstice is about our human history thousands of years before Jesus.\\nOur ancestors built solar temples and observatories all over the world to measure this day. These observatories were built of rock and stone and while they are accurate they are affected by the effects of precession. In many cases if not most, the Sun strikes the mark on three days. The Sun-worshipers called it three days of death because the sun stops moving along the horizon to the south. The rebirth is when the sun begins to move back to the north.\\n\\n One of the older known solar observatory is found in Africa and has been dated to around 8500 BCE. Stonehenge is another example which has been studied extensively. While we don’t know what these ancient people believed, we know they were observing and celebrating the winter solstice. The discovery of the winter solstice is how man learned to measure a solar year and the observation of this day is beneficial in determining the proper time of year to plant crops among other things.\\nThis discovery is in a sense the discovery of time. [The Dawn of Time.]\\nOur modern world revolves around this discovery.\\n\\nFrom that first year forward, the winter solstice has been a day of celebration which marks a solar year.\\n\\nWe celebrate The Dawn of Time”.\\n\\nHave a very happy Winter Solstice.\\nAnd may good fortune and happiness be yours.\\n\\n************************************************************************************************************************",0,0

We have nostalgia, and we have great young actors supporting Ryder.  It’s everything you could ask for in a TV show.  It’s what gives this show it’s cult vibe.

But it probably wont reach that even if it never fails again because BFR should eventually be able to take over for it expect for when you need a launch window which BFR will not be ready for, because I assume that a BFR will be in maintenance for at least 6 months between maybe 5 launches and landings so if you have a fleet of 5 for example that would only give you 50 launches per year so if you need a specific launch window you will probably be shit out of luck, which is why you will still need a few Falcon 9's and Falcon Heavys laying around even if/when BFR has demonstrated it's reliability.\\n\\nUnless they are going to have a fleet of 37 BFR's to cover every day of the year, and building and maintaining 4-5 BFR's is already ambitious.",0,0

iv1zeGSvhIw,@43:40 can somebody please explain why the speed of second stage is decreasing? Shouldn't it remain constant?,0,3
iv1zeGSvhIw,***NEED AN ANSWER: *** so when the stage 2 rocket is activated the traveling speed starts to go up quickly as there is few friction in the atmosphere at 300km altitude. At minute 42:02 immediately the speed stops to 35'262 km/h and then starts going back. How this? An object launched at so high speed how can instantly stop?????!!! Shouldn't have a continuos movement as there is no friction!?  Thanks to all for answer,0,7

iv1zeGSvhIw,"Excuse me, I've got a question (and maybe a stupid one, because I don't know what could be the answer). Instead of focusing and spending so much money on reaching Mars, wouldn't be better to focus on asteroid mining technology? I think that once that we will be capabel to gain materials in the space, we will be able to build our rockets directly in space, so that the ammount of fuel needed will be much less becouse we will have no more to escape our gravity.\\nHope that someone could clarify me that point.",0,4

nZtpLKCoUWg,"Robert E. Lee was an average military leader. He should have won at Gettysburg, but his incompetence got in his way. \\n\\nAs just about everything we are told about the Civil War, the great military leader myth was created during the reconstruction. General William Mahone was the great military leader of the Confederacy. He did not agree with Lee at Gettysburg, but carried out the orders as he was supposed to do. Mahone became vilified as a race traitor for his Readjuster Party. A black-majority party, the Readjusters legitimated and promoted African American citizenship and political power by supporting black suffrage, office-holding, and jury service. To a degree previously unseen in Virginia, and unmatched anywhere else in the nineteenth-century South, the Readjusters became an institutional force for the protection and advancement of black rights and interests.\\n\\nAnd Lee was an extremely cruel slave owners. While slavery was never less than cruel, Jefferson et al were generally among the more humane slavers.\\n\\nThough Jefferson is not without blame. He is largely the reason the South remained backward and dependent on slavery, while the North innovated and developed technologies. The latter was Lincoln's America.",0,0

nZtpLKCoUWg,"Straight up lied about Lincoln. Lincoln stated that he did not care what happened to the slaves so long as he won the war. He also stated that he didn't believe that blacks were equal to whites, and the Union had slaves and treated them worse than the southern states did. \\n    Also it has always been the right of every state to secede from the United States, and Lincoln denied the South that right, basically forcing them to either be forced to stay in the union or fight for the right he was denying them. He started the war by not letting the south go. And the real reason he didn't want to lose the south was because of it the high profit the cotton industry was making. It would financially cripple the US to lose the income created by the south, and THAT is why he denied their right to secede. The south did NOT want a war. Lincoln was more than willing to fight a war to keep that cotton.\\n    Look it up if you don't believe me. Neither side we're fully the good guys, but the South had the legal right to secede, and every state still has it. The Union was the greater of the two evils, and they've been running circus ever since.",0,1
nZtpLKCoUWg,"I agree with most of what he says but not how he says it, he leaves much out to press his point. Also it would come off as more impartially accurate if it was presented by either a foreigner or by a southerner who's past family died to uphold wrong views. As is it sounds like someone angry about the past and excited to  crush his opponents. He is very true with his description of the post civil war tragedy. However, he misses another great myth, the goodness of Abraham Lincoln. Lincoln used slavery to accomplish his political desires nothing more. Secondly if the Yankees (of whom I am) did not treat post civil war poor Southerners with such contempt for slavery the poor unemployed Southerners might not have ingrained in every son and daughter a love for what was supposedly taken and a distain for whom they feel took it (slaves). They were bored and had no real future so started the KKK, oddly enough African Americans Who were poor, bored, and had no real future tried the same thing in the 50s and 60s especially with groups like the black Panthers. Both groups made enemies out of their adversaries and sought to blame others instead of focusing on how to better their life now.

nZtpLKCoUWg,"The Confederacy were not traitors for wanting to leave the US any more than Britain is a traitor for leaving the modern European Union. One thing that the states rights people get correct on accident (despite trying to nefariously bury the slavery argument) is that the USA was not a singular country!!! It was 25-ish separate countries (or states; a state is an independent nation and not a region of another--this is a vocabulary unique to the USA because of this very incident) divided into about four different regions in a loose alliance based on their independence from foreign states (i.e. Britain). So when the Appalacians joined the Deep South to form the Confederacy, they were were not traitors to some great nation, they were simply Brexiting the loose alliance they had with the northerners against people on the other side of the world. \\n\\nYes, the statues are messed up, the Civil War was primarily about slavery, slavery is bad (duh) and the Confederate generals are far from great heroes or role models but... it is disingenuous--or ignorant in the least--to refer to them as traitors to some great Union that didn't really exist yet.",0,2

nZtpLKCoUWg,"I only have one criticism. I happened to be interested in Robert E Lee, so I researched him and found out about the Custis slaves. I've read that there is both evidence for and against the story, or at least certain parts of it, but that could be misleading. Regardless, the point I want to make is that the will of Lee's father-in-law said this:\\n\\nAnd upon the legacies to my four granddaughters being paid, and my estates that are required to pay the said legacies, being clear of debts, then I give freedom to my slaves, the said slaves to be emancipated by my executors in such manner as to my executors may seem most expedient and proper, the said emancipation to be accomplished in not exceeding five years from the time of my decease.\\n\\nGeorge Custis(Lee's father-in-law) died in 1857. Robert E. Lee freed his slaves in 1862. Five years. While slavery is still a heinous crime, I do think it is worth mentioning that Robert E. Lee complied with the wishes of his father's will. As for the whipping story, I've seen everything from Lee himself never whipped any of them,  to he never washed their backs with brine, to he did all of those things. I don't know enough about the subject to comment on it, but I just wanted to share. Anyway, once again, I really liked the video, I just had something I wanted to say. Keep doing a great job!",0,1
nZtpLKCoUWg,"Dude...really?  I think there are some reasons you might have just been a middle school history teacher.  Lee's relationship to slavery was complex, but you're spreading myths.  His only slave ownership had to do with the settlement of the Custis estate, which you mention, but it's not like he acted against the instructions of the will out of spite.  The will stated that the slaves were to be liberated within two years.  Lee - somewhat understandably - reasoned that booting all those people out onto the market with nothing to their name and no real prospects would not be in their best interest, so he sought out somebody to help manage a more organized release.  The slaves - also understandably - were not necessarily eager to entertain the technical niceties of the instructions regarding disposition of the estate, however, and there were...problems.  Some of them ran away.\\n\\nThis left Lee in something of a pickle.  If he didn't punish them real hard, it would encourage all those other folks he needed to manage to pull the same thing, so he erred to the wrong side of the fence.  It's certainly not his proudest moment by a long shot, but it's not like he was rubbing himself through his pants while it happened.  More importantly, the magnitude and specifics of the event are pretty much lost to history.  We have good reason to believe it wasn't as bad as the worst assessments, because the worst assessments were offered by a bunch of people who couldn't get the details of their story straight to save their lives.  We know that it happened because there's other evidence pretty clearly indicating that it did.  The are between that, however?  Kind of impossible to navigate.   While the appeal to moderation is a fallacy, I'm not sure how else to approach a problem like this with history.\\n\\nRegarding his statements on the nature of slavery, you're also grabbing the wrong words.  The only universe in which American slaves would have been better off in Africa is one where Europe as a whole just didn't know it existed, and even then it's a dodgy proposition.  I mean, look at it now for chrissakes.  Things weren't better back then.  Slavery was a terrible goddamn way to get it, but those who were displaced did at least get access to the fruits of the industrial revolution and the relative increase in standard of living that came with the transition.  Life in Uganda was not chilling by a lake eating fruit - it was living in a hostile jungle full of things that wanted to kill you without access to even the half-assed medical wisdom of the time, plus whatever fuckery the local colonial power decided to get up to.  It does not constitute an endorsement of slavery to contend that at least the victims got SOMETHING out of the whole ordeal, much as it is not an endorsement of diabetes to observe that at least it keeps me from being a drunk and in relatively good shape.  Both still eat.\\n\\nHowever, the particularly weird statement that Lee DID make about slavery was that it was bad, but it hurt white people worse, and there was nothing people could do about it, so we had to wait for Jesus to drop a liberty bomb or some shit.  I'm not joking.  When I try to put myself in the headspace of the time, I can understand the fact that people were citizens of their states first and their nation second and were more likely to follow their states whether they agreed with the policies or not (ultimately the reason why Lee ended up generalling and whatnot).  I don't agree with that, but I get it.  What I cannot wrap my brain around, however, is how somebody can observe that something is a moral injustice that shouldn't exist and then vacate any capacity to do anything about it.  I just don't quite grasp that.  And never mind the shit about how awful slavery was for white folks.  I mean, he's not wrong in one sense - it's not exactly great for your general moral fiber and relationship to the world to own dudes - but contrasting that with being held in actual bondage and not figuring the slaves have it worse is kind of ludicrous.\\n\\nRegarding this treason charge, I'd be interested to know if you think all those Catalans who voted for independence committed treason?  Or all the Scottish people who got narrowly beaten out in that referendum?  The Civil War was done to settle a question without a real answer - who gets to decide when you're out of the family?  Does a state get to unilaterally decide to remove itself from the Union, or does the Union have to give it permission?  The Confederacy posited that the former was true.  They were allowed to leave the nation whenever they wanted, so they acted as such.  There wasn't really any other action they COULD take, given that belief.  If you think you're allowed to go, and then you say you're going, but the other guy says no you can't and holds the door shut, if you don't punch him in the nuts and go anyway you're kind of just going along with what he says in the first place - that he's the one who gets to tell you when you can go.  About the only thing anybody did in that whole sad mess that could be considered treasonous was the seizure of federal military assets by the Confederacy, which gets complicated and questionable.",0,1
nZtpLKCoUWg,"This guy I mentioned that Robert E Lee had a twisted perception, right after he got done saying that you would be better off in Africa. Spoken like a man who has never been there. It's not as bad as India but this dude would be in for a rude Awakening if he decided to move back there. Not only do you have to worry about things like AIDS and to a much lesser extent, the Ebola virus, you also have to worry about rampant crime and things like food shortages. I used to think that some of the Cracked videos could be thoroughly entertaining but since Trump got elected they have been pushing there liberalisms harder than ever. All of these YouTube channels are just alienating viewers, I don't tune in to a comedy channel to get my news. If I wanted to do that I would just watch that crappy Daily Show on Comedy Central. These YouTube channels news clips are on par with The Daily Show but at least The Daily Show has good production values, even though the actual content is biased garbage. At least Jon Stewart knew it was supposed to be a joke, unlike that Trevor Noah douche and the idiots that worked at cracked. This channel has gotten so shity that I'm going to throw away all my old issues of cracked. Thanks a lot, fags.",0,1
nZtpLKCoUWg,"Hey if you want to go back to Africa forever - I'll send you a ticket - but since your ancestors were from West Africa - not Uganda, you have to go there - Liberia, Sierra Leone, Mali, Nigeria, - In fact I know dozens of people from Uganda, Nigeria, Kenya, and even Haiti - they immigrate here because even as bad as some people think it is here it's way worse there. And in General Lee's time it was a million times worse over there. I have a friend from Kenya - in his village at 13 the right of passage for boys was this you had to make your own spear and go out of the village and weren't allowed back until you hunted down and killed a male lion and dragged its carcass back to prove you were a man. Oh and he said only about a quarter of men come back alive the rest are killed by the lion.

nZtpLKCoUWg,"No. \\n\\n1. Lee was correct, the blacks at the time were better off here for the future of the race. It wasn't sunshine and happiness in Africa, tribes would kill, enslave, and battle each other. The Europeans that went there, for trade mind you, noticed this and decided they were dangerous. African leaders traded slaves from other tribes to the Europeans. If blacks, and others, weren't brought here, you wouldn't be up there today making videos, there would have been no Obama, or Ben Carson or Jordan... it was a tough road but look how it ended up.\\n2. He was a war hero, people forget he fought in the American Mexican war prior to the civil war, where he was victorious and celebrated. \\n3. stonewall set up a sunday school with his wife to teach slaves how to read and write and cared for them like family. \\n4. You can't put people on trial for crimes that would be considered immoral and wrong today when they weren't then.\\n5. All our forefathers were considered treasonous as far as Brittain is concerned.\\n6. We were still in early stages of becoming a solidified country. In terms of Politics, a state is the same as a governing country. Back then, people referred to themselves from the state they were from. It wasn't until after the civil war did Lincolhn really unite the country under a common federal law outside the constitution.\\n7. We should never forget our history. Statues don't always represent monuments of good, they simply are there for us to remember honor the past. Lee wasn't a dictator who took over a country, but, he was an American none the less.\\n8. Every society in world has a history involving slavery, ours being the least brutal, and shortest.\\n9. It was western jeudeo/Christian values that pushed for the freedom of peoples and the abolishment of slavery... and here we are today, treating those values as bad. \\n10. Cracked sucks",0,1

But it probably wont reach that even if it never fails again because BFR should eventually be able to take over for it expect for when you need a launch window which BFR will not be ready for, because I assume that a BFR will be in maintenance for at least 6 months between maybe 5 launches and landings so if you have a fleet of 5 for example that would only give you 50 launches per year so if you need a specific launch window you will probably be shit out of luck, which is why you will still need a few Falcon 9's and Falcon Heavys laying around even if/when BFR has demonstrated it's reliability.\\n\\nUnless they are going to have a fleet of 37 BFR's to cover every day of the year, and building and maintaining 4-5 BFR's is already ambitious.",0,0

z2v_rL5C8C8,"so i broke up with my boyfriend.. things were getting tough..we belonged to two different ethnic groups.. lets just say we knew we had a challenge ahead of us but we took a chance... we were fighting  alot.. let me start by saying he was a really sweet, motivated, romatic guy.. we had our good and bad sides together.. overall we had amazing memories.. lately things were going a little rough..he was hiding small things, he was lying over small things cause he's excuse was he didnt wanted to hurt me or get me upset.. blah blah.. one point he posted a pic of his ex and them together on his snapchat and that kind of made me feel disrespected cause if i did that he wouldve been really upset.. during that period i wasnt feeling him.. and plus we were long distance.. so when i came to his city i decided i would break up cause at that moment i felt that was the best thing for us.. he was heart broken and he accepted cause it was going bad and for once he didnt force or tried to fix this like he always does.. he simply respected my decision.. but now that its been a a week i miss him like crazy.. i cry everyday .. i think about the positive things... im just all over the place.. we agreed we''ll be friends but its so hard like.. i cant switch my feelings from being couples to friends.. i cry and think about our good times.. and lately ive been feeling i made a mistake mby all those arguments turned me off and i needed space.. now that we havent spoken it made me realize the good stuff we had.. he was the kind of guy that NEVER gave up.. evry fight argument we had he would always want to fix.. so i ended up calling him today and telling him how i felt .. i feel like deep down he was happy to see me suffering, i told him mby we made a mistake and didnt try solving it and we should've tried fixing it than breaking up.. and hes answer was oh i cant believe ur saying this.. this is unexpected, well im not attracted to you like i was before.. my feelings are a lot less for you than before and i need time to get there i felt like shit when he said that.. but i respected his decision.. but the thing that bothered me was.. he wants to keep talking and he want us to do our own things at the side as well.. and if its meant to be and if he feels something for me by talking occasionally like friends.. we will work it out.. but i cant just talk to him like like im all okay, cause im not, i have feelings for this guy, .. i cant just be waiting and pretend like im ok talking cause im not.. i want him back, i really do and i dont know what to do here...",0,0

bu9e410C__I,"To add on, I'm a little skeptical about the success of The New Mutants movie. I know nothing about the original comic but, if this is going to be an ongoing series (which, judging by the title it seems to be) then I don't see how the franchise will sell when the pilot is horror driven. Now I'm going to go out of my way and mention Harry Potter. The tone of that franchise went from light to dark. We've seen those characters go from innocent to remorseful. We had time to watch those characters grow and develop. When their darkest moments came, we were ready for it. This story however, starts from the darkest of the dark. Are we going to see these already dark characters become even more dark? Will we get any chance to laugh and grow with them? I don't really see how that would work on screen. Maybe The New Mutants franchise is something that isn't meant to be adapted for the screen. -If I'm wrong and the studios are somehow able to pull it off then cudos to them!",0,0

I know nothing about the original comic but, if this is going to be an ongoing series (which, judging by the title it seems to be) then I don't see how the franchise will sell when the pilot is horror driven. Now I'm going to go out of my way and mention Harry Potter. The tone of that franchise went from light to dark. We've seen those characters go from innocent to remorseful. We had time to watch those characters grow and develop. When their darkest moments came, we were ready for it. This story however, starts from the darkest of the dark. Are we going to see these already dark characters become even more dark? Will we get any chance to laugh and grow with them? I don't really see how that would work on screen. Maybe The New Mutants franchise is something that isn't meant to be adapted for the screen. -If I'm wrong and the studios are somehow able to pull it off then cudos to them!",0,0

By the way, you are only supposed to get one every four hours, but I bet if you're some NBA player, they make exceptions? Maybe he even gets Morphine? \\n\\nThe guy dislocated his ankle, all That's it. So what. No biggie. As I stated before and I'll state here. I have to forgive those of the NBA and the NFL today. They claim they want to keep politics out of pro sports, then dare lecture us out here about life. They are only little boys posing as grown men. This horrific injury is an example for all to see.\\n\\nSome men out here in the world have been through worse. One hell of a lot worse. Then I read on my news feed today about horrific, gruesome injury and how some can't even bear to look at some guy who has a dislocated ankle. Grow the heck up, NBA players, coaches and fans. And that goes for the NFL. \\n\\nSome of us have endured far, far worse than that guy. He isn't hurt that bad. Take it from me. Like bad. Like bad is looking down and seeing your left leg gone at mid-thigh. Bad is like your right foot missing half its front. Bad in like seeing three fingers gone from your left hand.\\n\\nPain? Are these supposed grown, tough men that weak? Pain? They will never know real pain. There are levels beyond pain and I have been there. Sadly. But I learned. I suggest these guys do the same.  Some grown man dislocated his ankle and it's some time to cry, sob and whine for that guy. He isn't hurt that bad. Not at all. And people are shocked by just looking at that? They need to get around more.\\n\\n“No, I can’t handle that, man,” Jimmy Butler said. Just by looking? How would you handle the 13 amputations I have had? No, not falling apart by just looking at someone. But being me? Man up, you. \\n\\nThen Mr. life lecture himself, who proves to me he has never lived as some of us men have, by stating this (according to Star Tribune): “I didn’t look, I couldn’t look,” Popovich said of the replay. “Just horrible, horrible for anybody, but with his circumstances — he’s new, the team probably spent a lot of the preseason doing things around him, setting up the team and then he’s gone like that. It’s just horrible, horrible.”\\n\\nHorrible? Horrible? When we have men with limbs torn off,  bones seared, spurting blood? Horrible? When we have men who has lost their limbs and are far worse? Horrible? Hey, aren't you that coach that feels compelled to lecture American men how to live their lives -- when he obviously knows nothing about life itself?\\n\\nIf that guy was hurt that bad, his limb would be amputated immediately. End of story. If not, quit whining about being hurt. These guys again show why they think they are bigger than real life, and every time one of them dislocates an ankle, breaks a bone or stubs their toes we get descriptions like  horrific, gruesome, shocking and only men who have never known real life  and being severely wounded -- or lost their friends to mortal wounds -- would ever say.\\n\\nThirteen amputations -- permanent injuries, by the way -- earn me the right to say what I do. Earned. Nothing I issue is abuse, hate speech, trolling, or being our-of-line. Fair enough?",0,0

bu9e410C__I,"To add on, I'm a little skeptical about the success of The New Mutants movie. I know nothing about the original comic but, if this is going to be an ongoing series (which, judging by the title it seems to be) then I don't see how the franchise will sell when the pilot is horror driven. Now I'm going to go out of my way and mention Harry Potter. The tone of that franchise went from light to dark. We've seen those characters go from innocent to remorseful. We had time to watch those characters grow and develop. When their darkest moments came, we were ready for it. This story however, starts from the darkest of the dark. Are we going to see these already dark characters become even more dark? Will we get any chance to laugh and grow with them? I don't really see how that would work on screen. Maybe The New Mutants franchise is something that isn't meant to be adapted for the screen. -If I'm wrong and the studios are somehow able to pull it off then cudos to them!",0,0

x0GbpqxD42k,"Gordon Haywood, perhaps,  gets an IV shot of Dilaudid -- perhaps explaining his upbeat mood --- and then addresses the ignorant masses with his bravery speech. By the way, you are only supposed to get one every four hours, but I bet if you're some NBA player, they make exceptions? Maybe he even gets Morphine? \\n\\nThe guy dislocated his ankle, all That's it. So what. No biggie. As I stated before and I'll state here. I have to forgive those of the NBA and the NFL today. They claim they want to keep politics out of pro sports, then dare lecture us out here about life. They are only little boys posing as grown men. This horrific injury is an example for all to see.\\n\\nSome men out here in the world have been through worse. One hell of a lot worse. Then I read on my news feed today about horrific, gruesome injury and how some can't even bear to look at some guy who has a dislocated ankle. Grow the heck up, NBA players, coaches and fans. And that goes for the NFL. \\n\\nSome of us have endured far, far worse than that guy. He isn't hurt that bad. Take it from me. Like bad. Like bad is looking down and seeing your left leg gone at mid-thigh. Bad is like your right foot missing half its front. Bad in like seeing three fingers gone from your left hand.\\n\\nPain? Are these supposed grown, tough men that weak? Pain? They will never know real pain. There are levels beyond pain and I have been there. Sadly. But I learned. I suggest these guys do the same.  Some grown man dislocated his ankle and it's some time to cry, sob and whine for that guy. He isn't hurt that bad. Not at all. And people are shocked by just looking at that? They need to get around more.\\n\\n“No, I can’t handle that, man,” Jimmy Butler said. Just by looking? How would you handle the 13 amputations I have had? No, not falling apart by just looking at someone. But being me? Man up, you. \\n\\nThen Mr. life lecture himself, who proves to me he has never lived as some of us men have, by stating this (according to Star Tribune): “I didn’t look, I couldn’t look,” Popovich said of the replay. “Just horrible, horrible for anybody, but with his circumstances — he’s new, the team probably spent a lot of the preseason doing things around him, setting up the team and then he’s gone like that. It’s just horrible, horrible.”\\n\\nHorrible? Horrible? When we have men with limbs torn off,  bones seared, spurting blood? Horrible? When we have men who has lost their limbs and are far worse? Horrible? Hey, aren't you that coach that feels compelled to lecture American men how to live their lives -- when he obviously knows nothing about life itself?\\n\\nIf that guy was hurt that bad, his limb would be amputated immediately. End of story. If not, quit whining about being hurt. These guys again show why they think they are bigger than real life, and every time one of them dislocates an ankle, breaks a bone or stubs their toes we get descriptions like  horrific, gruesome, shocking and only men who have never known real life  and being severely wounded -- or lost their friends to mortal wounds -- would ever say.\\n\\nThirteen amputations -- permanent injuries, by the way -- earn me the right to say what I do. Earned. Nothing I issue is abuse, hate speech, trolling, or being our-of-line. Fair enough?",0,0

Or you will die, even if you only looked at the word warning!\\nOnce there was a little girl called Clarissa, she was ten-years-old and she lived in a mental hospital, because she killed her mom and her dad. She got so bad she went to kill all the staff in the hospital so the More-government decided that best idea was to get rid of her so they set up aSPECIALROOM to kill her, as humane as possible but it went wrong the machine they were using went wrong. And she sat there in agony for hours until she died.\\nNow every week on the day of her death she returns to the person that reads this letter, on a monday night at 12:00a.m. She creeps into your room and kills you slowly, by cutting you and watching you bleed to death.\\nNow send this to ten other pictures on this one site, and she will haunt someone else who doesn't. This isn't fake. apparently, if u copy and paste this to ten comments in the next ten minutes u will have the best day of ur life tomorrow. u will either get kissed or asked out, if u break this chain u will see a little dead girl in your room tonight. in 53 mins someone will say i love you or imS",0,0

However, Frederica Wilson's behavior and backlash to the press was inappropriate, unprofessional, and uncalled for, and Meghan did the right thing by putting her in her place.
