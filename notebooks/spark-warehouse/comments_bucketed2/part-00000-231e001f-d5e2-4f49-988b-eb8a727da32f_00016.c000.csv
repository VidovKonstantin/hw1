jehAZhrI7oA,"My understanding of IT taking the form of Pennywise, at least based on the Tim Curry adaptation, was because typically Clowns were enjoyed. So IT would use the clown to get close and entice people to let their guard down. Which is kind of what happened in the first film adaptation where the little girl hears Pennywise laugh and she even smiles. It's not that people feared clowns so much as it was easier to set them up before knocking them down as a clown rather than say... the creature from the Black Lagoon.",0,0

You could take Mike, Stanley, and Ritchie out of the film and it would have changed absolutely nothing to the story. Also the added conflict with Henry at the end literally went nowhere and added nothing to the plot.\\n\\nThey should've spent more time developing the characters and showing us how their fear relates to their characters, such as Bill being afraid that Georgie is dead, rather than having a spooky scene with Pennywise every five minutes so the audience doesn't get bored!! Stanley being chased by a painting or Ben chased by a headless person could have been taken out to actually give us more about their characters so we feel for them when Pennywise does attack them. \\n\\n7.5/10.",0,0

jehAZhrI7oA,"To answer your question honestly, as a kid it would have been a swarm of wasps or yellow jackets. When I was 8 I went outside to play one day while my brother and another kid from the neighborhood threw rocks at a hive of yellow jackets. The yellow jackets attacked them and when they ran across the street in my direction I was stung several times. Didn't know it at the time but I was allergic to bee stings, this caused me to swell up bad and be admitted to the hospital.

jehAZhrI7oA,The kiss actually was more like the book. Fighting IT is just like the horror. It scares you with what you're scared of... and It can be fought with things you believe would work... so the belief of waking the girl with a kiss is certainly a thing like the kid would believe and so it worked. This was a MAJOR theme they did a TERRIBLE job of presenting in the film.,0,0

jehAZhrI7oA,"i don´t think that the reason Pennywise did not killed Beverly was because she was not scared, i think that it had to do with the fact that he realized that she is not longer a kid, because right before he was going to killed her he smelled something, it It was supposed to only eat kids at this point, or at least that is what i felt like for me",0,0

I'm pretty sure someone who has a healthy social life and is psychologically healthy isn't impervious to becoming obese from constantly overeating. I do agree that modern living is conducive to depression, isolation, stress, and anxiety, and that this in turn leads to people constantly eating as a means of coping. However, those are not the only reasons for overeating. I'm pretty sure that childhood obesity doesn't have much to do with emotional nourishment but more to do with poor parenting and just plain unhealthy eating habits.

In addition to choice we have nutritional science which is often used to back up trendy diets or clean eating that leads to restriction which reflects the unworthiness we feel. \\n\\nBut food tastes good, it makes us feel good, it's good, a state we strive to be. We're surrounded by normal people who think we're weird for caring about food so much. So we try to be normal _whatever that is_ reminding ourselves it's okay to eat as much as we want, it's normal yeah? \\n\\nBut then we hate ourselves and there is no way out of this careful tiptoe relationship with food.

I'm pretty sure someone who has a healthy social life and is psychologically healthy isn't impervious to becoming obese from constantly overeating. I do agree that modern living is conducive to depression, isolation, stress, and anxiety, and that this in turn leads to people constantly eating as a means of coping. However, those are not the only reasons for overeating. I'm pretty sure that childhood obesity doesn't have much to do with emotional nourishment but more to do with poor parenting and just plain unhealthy eating habits. Take a place like Samoa for instance. The reason for obesity there has almost everything to do with the food they are eating.",0,0

Dieting is a means of control, punishment, reward etc all these things that affect and are affected by emotion. However, I think turning to food starts with environmental factors. \\n\\nWe have access to an abundance and while convenient, it's overwhelming. In addition to choice we have nutritional science which is often used to back up trendy diets or clean eating that leads to restriction which reflects the unworthiness we feel. \\n\\nBut food tastes good, it makes us feel good, it's good, a state we strive to be. We're surrounded by normal people who think we're weird for caring about food so much. So we try to be normal _whatever that is_ reminding ourselves it's okay to eat as much as we want, it's normal yeah? \\n\\nBut then we hate ourselves and there is no way out of this careful tiptoe relationship with food.

h_mpwaCJUrY,"Cam den, here is the answer: These Entertainment People have been playing a big role in bringing these disasters upon us, like hurricanes, tornados, floods, fires, and so on. These people have been paralyzing us by drugs, alcohol, on their TV, and movies with all kinds of sex and music to the point that our people are not able to think anymore, and they do not know who created them from ejected semen, just read those posts. These are the people who made us a Godless nation. Another reason for these disasters are those illiterate preachers who have been raping our hearts and souls with fake information for just a few $. You Have All The Rights to Deny, and Reject All of These Existing Fake and False Religions! But, now we have the Scientifically Proven Scripture based on Mathematics the Exact Science, which tells you the truth about our Creator, but again this same media have been trying so hard to hide it from our people ever since 40 years ago. It says if you DO NOT thank your Creator every day for the roof over your head, for your jobs in order to get His provisions, for your health, protections, and happiness, and if you do not pay 10% of your earnings to the needy relatives, fatherless children, and homeless people, then DO NOT expect any protection from your Creator, although He has given us enough respites. This is the only message could save you, otherwise you are only going to suffer before our Land Lord Creator evict you from His temporary dwelling.  Listen to this song, they teach you to lean on a flimsy human instead of leaning on the Almighty Creator, Who is feeding them and protecting them every day and . . . .",0,0

h_mpwaCJUrY,"Few years back we got help with food and water and shelter and we were moved to Louisiana and Houston, so thank you. Then again we were facing with more disasters and floods when hurricane Harvey and Irma hit us.

bxgFjzRW6EA,"A small theory I have to explain why Harry had to win the first two rounds- EVENTUALLY, Voldemort WOULD want to come out and be like hahaha! I killed Harry Potter! Your champion! Yup! Wouldn't it be pretty pathetic if Voldemort made such a huge deal out of defeating Harry, and he WASN'T the best wizard of his age? Perhaps setting Harry up for a miraculous victory was intended to build Harry's image up so that his defeat would seem even more tragic and feed into Voldemort's sense of pride.\\n\\nAlternatively, it's just possible that they needed him to place as high as possible to give him a head start on the other contestants in the final round. After all, it would seem much more believable that he made it to the center of the maze first having gone in first, than if he went in last and miraculously made it out first.",0,0

bxgFjzRW6EA,"I think the real answer is much simpler:\\nThe Cup was supposed to teleport the winner infront of the audience. It was probably one of the teachers who enchanted it in the first place. Enchanting a port key probably doesn't require touching it, so Crouch just enchanted it to take the first one to Voldemort. Because he enchanted it after the first enchantment his took the priority, thus it took Harry and Cedric to Voldemort and then back to Hogwarts.",0,0

Or perhaps that was the least of his worries? Mostly, he wanted to be whole again... and of course to kill Harry.\\n\\nI think this is a simpler explanation.",0,0

(not mine credit to whoever did this) What if Harry survives because of Snape? Hear me out. Lily can't be the only mother who died for their children, surely? What if ol' Voldy made a secret vow to Snape. Like how the GoF gave you a vow so u had to be in the Triwizard tournment, he promised Snape he would spare lily. Note how James was killed instantly (Another plot hole- Why was it lily died for harry when james died first?) and voldemort tried to make lily move aside so he could get harry. She didn't enraging voldemort, and he forgets the vow or doesnt know its there and murders lily. My only hole in this theory is why did he die when he attacked Harry?

bxgFjzRW6EA,"Perhaps the whole thing has to do with the excessive security at Hogwarts; for all we know, one of those lovely dingbobs on Dumbledore's desk is a dial that goes ding when someone tries to sneak a Portkey onto the grounds. We certainly don't see any other Portkeys used to get in or out of the campus, suggesting that it is not a viable means normally. But if the Cup is a known exception, that for the reasons you mention, nesting a second Portkey within the first as sort of a first stop between start and destination would be a clever means of getting Harry off the premises. It wouldn't make anything go ding unexpectedly, and there's the added bonus of confusing everyone at the school who, knowing that the Cup is supposed to transport people to the front of the Maze, would simply assume that it malfunctioned rather than being hijacked, at least initially. The possible return trip might have simply been forgotten about as a detail, since no one was planning to use it. Cheating to get Harry to win the tournament wouldn't necessarily strike Voldemort as THAT complicated, and it's easier than waiting a full year for some scheme involving broken Vanishing Cabinets. There just aren't that many good ways for someone to sneak into or out of Hogwarts normally speaking.\\n\\nI don't buy the returning-as-Harry thing. With only a dead-and-also-inside-Nagini Harry to work with, and thus no source of further hair follicles, the plot would only work for several hours before wearing off. Not a lot of time, if you are quite correctly expecting Harry to get interrogated (by a Legilimens, no less) for hours upon his return.",0,0

bxgFjzRW6EA,"I agree, that the cup was intended to send the winner back to the entrance. \\nBut I don't think Barty Crouch Jr.  set it specifically to work twice. \\n\\nAs I see it, he simply put one spell over another. He was not able to undo the first one, the one sending the winner to the entrance. Instead he just overlapped it with a second spell sending the winner to the graveyard. \\n\\nAs Harry touches the cup the first spell triggers sending them to the graveyard. However I don't think it was intended, that harry gets transported back with the cup. \\n\\nThis solution has less implications aka he wanted harry to come back. Instead it is just based of his lack of abillity to undi a spell of a migthier wizzard. Or maybe, we should be more precise here. He just did not care. Laying one spell over another is simpler then removing or changing the first one. And why should he assume, that harry would return at all? After all he send him to his death..\\n\\nSo I'd say it wasn't so much a specific plan of voldemort which allowed harry to come back. But simply heedlessnes to ignore the posibillity. \\n\\nYour Idea with the imposter Harry sounds good doesn't work. How long do you think the imposter can keep up with that? Problem is, Harry would have to be kept alive for ingedients. Like Barty had to keep Mad eye Moodie alive. \\n\\nPeter pettinggrew isn't the most trusted deatheater either. Voldemord thinks he is weak. He just uses him. Because he is weak. I see no way Peter could impose as Harry. And Ron and Hermione would probaply see straight through anyone who trys. \\n\\nIf Harry would not have had returned. The first asumption would probaply be, that the maze killed him. It is not the first time a participant died or vanished. Even if dumpledor would have figured it out he would have had even less evidence then with a death cedric and harrys words.",0,0

Wb-6fhfAn2I,"Interesting video, even though I do not agree totally. \\nSurely some people feel the hurge to eat because they seek emotions (I've experienced that) but some words in this video appear to me a little to much, as it seems that seeking emotions is the only reason for binge eating.\\nI think there are other various causes why some people end up obese, that go further the need of emotions, and lays in toxic behaviours or simply a bad food education, for example. \\nAnyway, I didn't want to be polemic, this is still a very inspiring video, that could help some people out there!\\nThank you for the weekly inspiration!",0,0
Wb-6fhfAn2I,"I don't like that this channel always tries to relate our issues to lack of love or affection. It sounds like the people who say gay people are gay because their parents didn't love them- for most it isn't true, and it's a terrible generalization of the problem which keeps us from looking any further because we think we already have the answer. Personally, I think I overeat because I was always told to finish all of my food. I end up throwing leftovers away if I have them because they get stale, or bland, or don't taste as good reheated, but I feel guilty if I throw away fresh food. I feel less guilty if I just eat it. I don't overeat because of a lack of love, I overeat because of a lack of discipline.",0,0
Wb-6fhfAn2I,"I have to say I agree with what the video is saying. Some people take emotional eating too far. Me included. I used food not only for solace, but also for protection. When I was large, I was less attractive to men, and at some level I felt safe because of that. I've experienced things early on that hurt my ability to form good relationships with others. \\n\\nAfter having an emotional collapse earlier this year, and intensive therapy since, I've come to realise that the claim dieting is treating the symptoms in this video is correct. And treating the symptoms will only last so long, until it doesn't anymore. I've claimed that I love food, but what I really meant was I loved eating food. Because it provided solace and protection. Now, I am beginning to form a healthy relationship with food, and I will love it eventually.\\n\\nMaybe doctors should prescribe therapy rather than diet pills. \\n\\nBut, every case is different. I cannot speak for everyone. I only hope people will have some compassion for others, like the people I now I have in my life.",0,0

Lots of dairy, sweets, grains, and meat, Little to no vegetables at all. \\nSo you and the rest of the children grow up eating literally crap, with a ton of horrid habits that are insanely difficult to grow out of. \\n\\nIf you want to blame anyone for all the fat people you currently see, start with the parents.

But this film, like many of our films, is focused on the emotional component of our behaviour and especially, the emotional relationship we build up with food when emotions with people become a little complicated. We're not saying that food doesn't taste nice; it tastes very nice indeed. We are saying that this niceness becomes all the more important when the rest of life is not showing its niceness to us. The same argument can be made around drugs. Cocaine and heroin can feel very nice indeed - but our susceptibility to this niceness grows acute when our lives are especially disconnected from others and in arduous phases.",0,3

h_mpwaCJUrY,"Cam den, here is the answer: These Entertainment People have been playing a big role in bringing these disasters upon us, like hurricanes, tornados, floods, fires, and so on. These people have been paralyzing us by drugs, alcohol, on their TV, and movies with all kinds of sex and music to the point that our people are not able to think anymore, and they do not know who created them from ejected semen, just read those posts. These are the people who made us a Godless nation. Another reason for these disasters are those illiterate preachers who have been raping our hearts and souls with fake information for just a few $. You Have All The Rights to Deny, and Reject All of These Existing Fake and False Religions! But, now we have the Scientifically Proven Scripture based on Mathematics the Exact Science, which tells you the truth about our Creator, but again this same media have been trying so hard to hide it from our people ever since 40 years ago. It says if you DO NOT thank your Creator every day for the roof over your head, for your jobs in order to get His provisions, for your health, protections, and happiness, and if you do not pay 10% of your earnings to the needy relatives, fatherless children, and homeless people, then DO NOT expect any protection from your Creator, although He has given us enough respites. This is the only message could save you, otherwise you are only going to suffer before our Land Lord Creator evict you from His temporary dwelling.  Listen to this song, they teach you to lean on a flimsy human instead of leaning on the Almighty Creator, Who is feeding them and protecting them every day and . . . .",0,0

h_mpwaCJUrY,"Few years back we got help with food and water and shelter and we were moved to Louisiana and Houston, so thank you. Then again we were facing with more disasters and floods when hurricane Harvey and Irma hit us. But, the real help would be to find out that why we are facing these disasters one after the other, therefore we could avoid these disasters. So money is NOT the real help. How come some of us get killed and get hit with property damages and others don’t? What is the real reason behind these sufferings?

bxgFjzRW6EA,I think the cup was the only authorized Portkey that would have worked in Hogwarts and was probably only enchanted to work when touched by one of the contestants which is where the binding magical contract part comes in so all Moodycould have done was added the location of the graveyard and thats why they needed Harry to win after that first touch the original location took effect,0,0

bxgFjzRW6EA,"0:23 -  Was it really necessary for Harry to win The Cup to kidnap him?\\nWell maybe it was. If you wanted to teleport him out of Hogwarts. Normally you cannot teleport out of Hogwarts. But it seems that portkeys can. We had seen Dumbledore using portkey to teleport Harry from Hogwarts to Burrow and from Ministry to Hogwarts (Fifth book). If any portkey can do that, then this whole Anti-teleportation Spell would be *useless* . But what if only *Headmaster* could create such portkey (because he is owner of Hogwarts)? If Dumbledore was supposed to put such type of portkey-spell on Cup to teleport winner from center of the maze to entrance of the maze and Crouch knew that, then maybe Voldemort figured out that if you put another portkey-spell *on the same object* then it would *still* ignore this Anti-teleportation Spell.\\nBut Crouch would have to wait until Dumbledore creates such portkey in first place. And probably he just did that in the very day of the Third Task.",1,0
bxgFjzRW6EA,This is an interesting theory I don't think it's the case and believe it's just another story plot JK didn't work through.,0,0
bxgFjzRW6EA,For the FIRST time i do NOT agree with you. (beside the fact they skiped the backfirespeedingworms or what ever it was named in English you sed it i did not get it) \nI think his plan was to come buck with everyone because you can not teleport inside Hogwarts so he would have the element of seprice cought them off gaurd and kill Dambledore on sight. There goes his to Bigest enemies. After all why hide after Potter is dead. He did not hide before so why start now? He thinks he is invincible after Potter is gone and with more Horcruxes in tack!

(Page 572)\\nThis got me thinking; could Dumbledore actually break out? Considering his extreme dislike and fear of dementors, his considerable amount of terrible memories and feelings (the way he reacts to drinking the liquid in the end of book 6), and the fact that he would not have a wand. He is a man only one year away from dying at this point after all. I would love to hear your thoughts + theory :DD",0,0

bxgFjzRW6EA,"Thank you for this theory, it's really great! Although it does raise some questions...\\n\\nSo if Nagini eats Harry, how does Wormtail polyjuice himself into Harry at least until the end of term? Or even if she doesn't eat him, once Harry's dead, the polyjuice resources would still be limited by his corpse's decay? Wouldn't it be preferable to keep him alive as long as need be and why not until Voldemort's return to the face of the world so he can kill him under everyone's nose (not minding, of course, the risks of Harry escaping or being rescued by that time, nor Voldemort's urge to kill the boy after having waited so long)?\\n\\nBut anyway, would it also mean that they'd only need to maintain fake Harry until summer and then let him vanish when he's supposed to be under his muggle family's care? Or should fake Harry be maintained until Voldemart's official return?\\n\\nAnd what about Wormtail killing Cedric Diggory? Ok, the problem of Harry's death is handled as non existent, but according to his original plan (where of course Harry wasn't supposed to bring someone to share the victory with him, but still), does Voldemort also send a fake Cedric back or does he place his corpse back in the maize as a Tournament casualty or doesn't he mind about legitimising that specific disappearance?\\n\\nHaaa, so many questions, please... I need answers! ^^",0,0
bxgFjzRW6EA,I'm pretty sure you have to take material from a living person for the Polyjuice potion to work. That's why they kept the real moody alive.,0,0
bxgFjzRW6EA,"There is one HUGE yet easily missed problem with your polyjuice theory. It doesn't matter if Vodemort or Wormtail were to use it. The sample subject, in this case, Harry, needs to be alive for the potion to work. This is why Barty Jr. kept Moody alive in the trunk. Otherwise, Barty Jr. could have just shaved off all of Moody's hair, and killed Moody. \\n\\nNow, granted, they could keep Harry alive and still go through with whatever the plan would have been... but given Voldemort's paranoia of the prophecy, can you really see him allowing Harry to live, even as a prisoner?\\n\\nI think the reason behind the cup is much simpler, and likely far less interesting. I think that the cup had been made a portkey before Barty Jr. ever got his hands on it, and so when he made it a portkey to the graveyard, he layered that spell over the existing portkey spell and in doing so, made it so that the graveyard spell would be the first spell to be touch-triggered. When they dropped the cup on arrival, one murder and a torture later, the cup was simply forgotten.",0,0

bxgFjzRW6EA,"Cedric wasn't supposed to die, so I agree how they would probably pretend Harry was a casualty in a very dangerous tournament. I think the only thing about Harry that interested Voldemort was the fact he managed to survive, he escaped and was famous for that, which probably hurt Voldy's pride. Then, after their encounter at the cemetery, everything changed. Harry was strong in duel, Priori Incantatem happened and Voldemort lost another chance to kill the boy. Their connection only got stronger after Goblet of Fire as Voldemort recognized Potter as a true rival, not just a simple boy. The book served as a transition from the adventurous school times to the dark reality of a war. Perhaps, his plan was quite simple. Voldemort needed to have eyes and ears in Hogwarts to test Harry and Dumbledore and to know where he was stepping.",0,0

In the books it does say that he did so to constantly extract information from the real mad eye so he could continue to fool Dumbledore, as well as that moody would continue to grow hair if he was kept alive meaning crouch would have an unlimited supply and wouldn't run out before the final of the tri-wizard tournament.

bxgFjzRW6EA,"Correct me if I'm wrong but if remember correctly: The problem with feeding Harry to Nagini and using  Polyjuice Potion to impersonate as him by using strands of his hair, is that they still need to keep Harry alive.

bxgFjzRW6EA,"It would'nt work out the way you explained. Because Polyjuice Potion works ONLY on LIVING People. If the one, who you want to look alike dies, the Potion can not work anymore. That's the reason, why Barty Crouch Jr. had kept Moody alive the whole year he was in Hogwarts...",0,0

bxgFjzRW6EA,"A small theory I have to explain why Harry had to win the first two rounds- EVENTUALLY, Voldemort WOULD want to come out and be like hahaha! I killed Harry Potter! Your champion! Yup! Wouldn't it be pretty pathetic if Voldemort made such a huge deal out of defeating Harry, and he WASN'T the best wizard of his age? Perhaps setting Harry up for a miraculous victory was intended to build Harry's image up so that his defeat would seem even more tragic and feed into Voldemort's sense of pride.\\n\\nAlternatively, it's just possible that they needed him to place as high as possible to give him a head start on the other contestants in the final round. After all, it would seem much more believable that he made it to the center of the maze first having gone in first, than if he went in last and miraculously made it out first.",0,0

There would be no reason for getting rid of the original destination as no one would need it after Voldemort killed Harry. Of course, another possibility is that the Maze destination could have been left on for future use. No one said he had to use it RIGHT THEN... at any point in the future Voldemort and his army of baddies could just appear on the grounds of Hogwarts, no problem. He could just wait until he was strong enough and poof! there they are, and SURPRISE1 Dumbledore! \\n\\nI do like the idea of sending Harry's body back.

bxgFjzRW6EA,"Let's be honest here.\\n\\nThe most logical reason that the portkey had a return feature is the magic had to be layered.\\n\\nThe portkey would of been the most protected part of the  tournament.\\n\\nThe ministry of magic monitors  teleportation, so this key would be under heavy guard especially since this tournament was banned.\\n\\nSo I'm guessing that voldy had to layer the spells in such a way that it did not trigger a warning of some kind.",0,0

Wb-6fhfAn2I,"To the people saying this video is wrong....it's not wrong it just isn't the whole story for everyone. None of us have perfect relationships across the board. There's one part of our lives concerning other people that will simply fail to measure up. Whether that's with our parents, our friends, a love, our co-workers...or even our ability to make good first impressions on complete strangers. There's something in our lives that will cause us to as others have said in the comment section, to eat our problems or Stress eat. A lot of the things we come to stress about are caused by other people or our failure to meet expectations. \\n\\nWhile the video wasn't wrong, it wasn't the beginning and ending as to why we eat so much. There are other reasons as well. imo a reason that's even bigger than this is, we eat so much because the sugar industry as complete control and pumps sugar into american foods. Even the meat. And we gobble it up because it FEELS good. Some people drink alcohol, others take drugs, others get high.....and many binge eat. All the same shit.",0,0

Wb-6fhfAn2I,I love these videos but this one is the first one I have a real problem with. We eat to much bc we are addicted to sugar.  The modern industrial diet is loaded with cheap carbs that reek havoc on your metabolic hormones. The appetite is triggered not based on the body's caloric or nutritional needs but on its over-reliance on a completely unnatural amount of daily carbs to maintain blood sugar levels as insulin resistance increases over time. The epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes is not simply a psychological or emotional issue. Its all about biology and the miseducation we have all recieved about what our body really needs.,0,0
Wb-6fhfAn2I,"So true from my personal experience when I was doing well in work and actually like going there, sleep well, not stressed about anything and go to the gym every day it wasn't hard for me to eat well and less even though I used to be overweight I lost a lot during that time I was so much healthier.

I told her that I'm not the athletic type and she told that I should look after my body and that she can't understand this refusal. I agree with the School of Life on that I hate myself too much to do myself the honour of looking after my body. But then I'm a little sceptical.

It sounds like the people who say gay people are gay because their parents didn't love them- for most it isn't true, and it's a terrible generalization of the problem which keeps us from looking any further because we think we already have the answer. Personally, I think I overeat because I was always told to finish all of my food. I end up throwing leftovers away if I have them because they get stale, or bland, or don't taste as good reheated, but I feel guilty if I throw away fresh food. I feel less guilty if I just eat it. I don't overeat because of a lack of love, I overeat because of a lack of discipline.",0,0
Wb-6fhfAn2I,"I have to say I agree with what the video is saying. Some people take emotional eating too far. Me included. I used food not only for solace, but also for protection. When I was large, I was less attractive to men, and at some level I felt safe because of that. I've experienced things early on that hurt my ability to form good relationships with others. \\n\\nAfter having an emotional collapse earlier this year, and intensive therapy since, I've come to realise that the claim dieting is treating the symptoms in this video is correct. And treating the symptoms will only last so long, until it doesn't anymore. I've claimed that I love food, but what I really meant was I loved eating food. Because it provided solace and protection. Now, I am beginning to form a healthy relationship with food, and I will love it eventually.\\n\\nMaybe doctors should prescribe therapy rather than diet pills. \\n\\nBut, every case is different. I cannot speak for everyone. I only hope people will have some compassion for others, like the people I now I have in my life.",0,0

Wb-6fhfAn2I,"We? Well ok, I used to overeat, but I've mastered moderation when it comes to eating. I ate the most when I was depressed and I was hanging out with a friend of mine that's obese.

Wb-6fhfAn2I,"Never heard of someone being bored so they eat celery... Clearly some people like lying to themselves and everyone around them. \\nLong time ago fat was a sign or wealth and prosperity. An image of someone with money, and good food. Like a fucking luxury car today; in which some fat fuck might slide out of. \\nParents don't have a problem with giving their children what they want; and what children want is a bunch of garbage. Lots of dairy, sweets, grains, and meat, Little to no vegetables at all. \\nSo you and the rest of the children grow up eating literally crap, with a ton of horrid habits that are insanely difficult to grow out of. \\n\\nIf you want to blame anyone for all the fat people you currently see, start with the parents. No one knocked on their door with weapons and told them they had to eat crap. Next you can blame advertising and fast food, but it all starts with your parents.",0,0

Or: it can't be true because it's just about biology. With respect, we entirely recognise the truth of these lines of argument. But this film, like many of our films, is focused on the emotional component of our behaviour and especially, the emotional relationship we build up with food when emotions with people become a little complicated. We're not saying that food doesn't taste nice; it tastes very nice indeed. We are saying that this niceness becomes all the more important when the rest of life is not showing its niceness to us. The same argument can be made around drugs. Cocaine and heroin can feel very nice indeed - but our susceptibility to this niceness grows acute when our lives are especially disconnected from others and in arduous phases.",0,4

V-_HM2bRa0E,"If we didn't know this was Craig and just heard it on the radio, what would you all think of the quality?

ZtXkNMbjOEE,"Cam den & ReligionwhistleBlower, Here is how media and entertainment society brainwashed us. They have been showing us that it is ok to go all around the world to those poor countries and kill millions of their innocent people and take away their natural resources. They have been showing us that it is ok to kill 10 million Native Americans together with their buffalos. They have been showing us that black lives don’t matter. They showed us that it is ok to throw atomic bomb and kill innocent people. They took away the name of our Creator from the face of our nation and they let those illiterate preachers who worship idols mislead us, that is why the Angeles of the Almighty, the drives of the wind bring down 1900 tornados upon them every year plus floods, fires, and hurricanes, and mudslides. Our media have been showing us that fast foods are good for us, yet every year people are dying of cancers and many other diseases instead of a normal death. They have been showing us that chemical fertilizers are good, and they say spray your food with chemical poisons it is good for you. Our media have been showing us that polluting the air is ok and we don’t get lung cancer because of that. They have been promoting cigarettes; alcohol and gambling in order for us to die of lung cancers, accidents, family problems, and divorces. They have been promoting all kinds of sex, adulteries and homosexuality in order for us to get different diseases and aid killing 49 million so far. They have been showing us that killing our own people it is ok, that is how they have been promoting guns for all. They have been showing us that white color crimes are ok, that is why they do not charge those highly educated criminals. Everything our media have taught us is against the laws of our creator. You are right they have been hiding the awesome message of our creator based on mathematics ever since 40 some years ago. The crimes that media have committed are far greater than all of those criminals from the beginning of time combined. Leaving the system of our creator only brings down suffering and disasters upon us. Therefore, when the Almighty sends His next disaster just make sure that is the consequence of our own wrong doings, so do not complain. His law is, “Nothing happens to you if you follow the rules of our Creator”.",1,0

bxgFjzRW6EA,"@SuperCarlinBrothers I have a really good one for you guys.\\n\\nSo in Book 1, Voldemort is clearly at Hogwarts (via cohabitating Quirrell's body).  In Book 7, we learn that Voldemort has a Horcrux (i.e. the lost diadem of Ravenclaw) at the school.\\nObviously the main draw for Voldemort is the Sorcerer's Stone (with eternal life and all), but why did he not go for the Horcrux, which he put there himself and will restore him to a body!!!!???\\nIs this just a plot hole that JK Rowling didn't intend when she was first writing the books, or was this intentional and Voldemort didn't trust Quirrell to carry this out for him?",1,0
bxgFjzRW6EA,"0:23 -  Was it really necessary for Harry to win The Cup to kidnap him?\\nWell maybe it was. If you wanted to teleport him out of Hogwarts. Normally you cannot teleport out of Hogwarts. But it seems that portkeys can. We had seen Dumbledore using portkey to teleport Harry from Hogwarts to Burrow and from Ministry to Hogwarts (Fifth book). If any portkey can do that, then this whole Anti-teleportation Spell would be *useless* . But what if only *Headmaster* could create such portkey (because he is owner of Hogwarts)? If Dumbledore was supposed to put such type of portkey-spell on Cup to teleport winner from center of the maze to entrance of the maze and Crouch knew that, then maybe Voldemort figured out that if you put another portkey-spell *on the same object* then it would *still* ignore this Anti-teleportation Spell.\\nBut Crouch would have to wait until Dumbledore creates such portkey in first place. And probably he just did that in the very day of the Third Task.",1,0

It is as follows (originally sent as texts to my friends):\\nOkay, am I the only one who thought Grindlewald's comment to Newt at the end - Will we die, just a little? - was out of the blue and didn't really make sense? (Theories of Horcruxes - nonsensical, of course for many reasons, most involving Dumbledore - notwithstanding.) As far as I'm aware, it's not a quote from anything nor does it have any meaning within the known Potter-verse (I say known for a reason, we'll get to it in a sec). So why put it in (aside from having to give Johnny Depp lines)? Why would Grindlewald say it all and specifically to Newt? I have a couple of theories/evidences that could help explain this. So, we know that Newt travels a lot saving magical creatures. We know that he was a favorite of Dumbledore's when he was in school. His older brother fought in World War I while he was off doing something with some dragons. The ministry of magic is not  particularly fond of him, despite them being the ones who commissioned his book. He still has his wand despite being kicked out of Hogwarts. He has met, from the sound of it, multiple Obscurials aside from Credence and has been working to find a cure. Now, we know that Grindlewald has a strong connection to Dumbledore, and while we know the two of them fell out of touch, we don't know how out of touch. Since his teenage years with Dumbledore, Grindlewald has undoubtedly been traveling around the world too. His quest is first and foremost to find the Deathly Hallows (which he has one of already at this point since he stole it from Gregorovitch - this happens to be THE MOST POWERFUL WAND TO EVER HAVE EXISTED). But he's also on a quest for Wizard supremacy over muggles. This, in his mind, entails revealing the Wizarding community to muggles and then lead some kind of take-over. He almost certainly had some role in World War I trying to wreak havoc on the muggles (there's probably a Wonder Woman tie in there but that's a different discussion). His revealing of the magical community could probably be brought about by magical beasts - he may have been actively seeking them out at one point. His quest definitely led him to think of Obscurials as a way to reveal wizards (an idea that almost definitely came to him because of Ariana Dumbledore). He gradually grew until he was a huge threat to the ENTIRE WORLD of Wizards and constantly evaded capture (the newspapers at the beginning of the movie). And there's definitely a lot more to be revealed in the upcoming movies, which is where we come to the theory part and the reason I said the KNOWN Potter-verse earlier. What do all these little pieces of information that we've gathered mean? Well, Newt and Grindlewald were both traveling the world and were probably in a lot of the same places considering that they may have been looking for very similar things, albeit for very, very different reasons. Thusly, how hard is it to believe that they came face to face at some point in the past? There are a ridiculous amount of connections between the two and the odds of them NOT meeting at some point are considerably lower than the odds of them bumping into each other. Who's to say exactly what may have happened in this encounter - I don't think Newt is quite powerful enough to stop Grindlewald, especially if he's carrying the Elder Wand - but I think it could explain a few things. Newt seems very knowledgeable about Grindlewald's methods (interrogation scene) and Graves (Grindlewald) knows a lot about Newt (I mean, yeah, files and stuff, but how much info does MACUSA have on hand about a BRITISH wizard?) and he's very quick to sentence him to death - and yeah, that might be because Newt seemed to figure out his secret ID, but how would he figure it out so quick, and how would Grindlewald know that Newt knew and deem him a big enough liability that he needs to die? - as if he knows that Newt could cause problems. Basically, the entire interrogation scene makes a tad bit more sense with the perspective that they may have met. Which in turn lends some extra context for... well basically everything else in the movie, creating that much more depth to the story. And then there's what we started with: Will we die, just a little? It's not only the line that makes this theory seem likely, it's Newt's reaction. Or lack thereof. He doesn't seem confused or shocked or anything really. And while Newt isn't one to show a whole bunch of emotion, you'd think an out of context line like that would at least make him frown, right? Instead he just kind of nods like he's pondering the question. But it's not just that. It's like he's heard the words before and has more to think about in regard to them (like when you get a question at the beginning of class and then again at the end). I think that Grindlewald's words have a deeper meaning than we as the audience are led to believe, especially when spoken to Newt. To me, it seems like Newt had a run-in with Grindlewald sometime in the past that may have changed his life/behaviors/beliefs/world view (this may also tie in to Lita Lestrange and his relationship with her - or lack thereof in the movie). Sometime in that meeting, Grindlewald said something to Newt that included this question and context to go with it. And that will be explained in the future movies. That also would explain why this movie series about Newt is going to so heavily rely on Grindlewald's reign. Or why the timeline of Grindlewald's reign of power includes Newt so much. There's more of a connection between the two characters than we've been led to believe.",0,0

(Page 572)\\nThis got me thinking; could Dumbledore actually break out? Considering his extreme dislike and fear of dementors, his considerable amount of terrible memories and feelings (the way he reacts to drinking the liquid in the end of book 6), and the fact that he would not have a wand.

bxgFjzRW6EA,"Thank you for this theory, it's really great! Although it does raise some questions...\\n\\nSo if Nagini eats Harry, how does Wormtail polyjuice himself into Harry at least until the end of term? Or even if she doesn't eat him, once Harry's dead, the polyjuice resources would still be limited by his corpse's decay? Wouldn't it be preferable to keep him alive as long as need be and why not until Voldemort's return to the face of the world so he can kill him under everyone's nose (not minding, of course, the risks of Harry escaping or being rescued by that time, nor Voldemort's urge to kill the boy after having waited so long)?\\n\\nBut anyway, would it also mean that they'd only need to maintain fake Harry until summer and then let him vanish when he's supposed to be under his muggle family's care? Or should fake Harry be maintained until Voldemart's official return?\\n\\nAnd what about Wormtail killing Cedric Diggory? Ok, the problem of Harry's death is handled as non existent, but according to his original plan (where of course Harry wasn't supposed to bring someone to share the victory with him, but still), does Voldemort also send a fake Cedric back or does he place his corpse back in the maize as a Tournament casualty or doesn't he mind about legitimising that specific disappearance?\\n\\nHaaa, so many questions, please... I need answers! ^^",0,0
bxgFjzRW6EA,I'm pretty sure you have to take material from a living person for the Polyjuice potion to work. That's why they kept the real moody alive.,0,0
bxgFjzRW6EA,"There is one HUGE yet easily missed problem with your polyjuice theory. It doesn't matter if Vodemort or Wormtail were to use it. The sample subject, in this case, Harry, needs to be alive for the potion to work. This is why Barty Jr. kept Moody alive in the trunk. Otherwise, Barty Jr. could have just shaved off all of Moody's hair, and killed Moody. \\n\\nNow, granted, they could keep Harry alive and still go through with whatever the plan would have been... but given Voldemort's paranoia of the prophecy, can you really see him allowing Harry to live, even as a prisoner?\\n\\nI think the reason behind the cup is much simpler, and likely far less interesting. I think that the cup had been made a portkey before Barty Jr. ever got his hands on it, and so when he made it a portkey to the graveyard, he layered that spell over the existing portkey spell and in doing so, made it so that the graveyard spell would be the first spell to be touch-triggered. When they dropped the cup on arrival, one murder and a torture later, the cup was simply forgotten.",0,0

bxgFjzRW6EA,"Cedric wasn't supposed to die, so I agree how they would probably pretend Harry was a casualty in a very dangerous tournament. I think the only thing about Harry that interested Voldemort was the fact he managed to survive, he escaped and was famous for that, which probably hurt Voldy's pride. Then, after their encounter at the cemetery, everything changed. Harry was strong in duel, Priori Incantatem happened and Voldemort lost another chance to kill the boy. Their connection only got stronger after Goblet of Fire as Voldemort recognized Potter as a true rival, not just a simple boy. The book served as a transition from the adventurous school times to the dark reality of a war. Perhaps, his plan was quite simple. Voldemort needed to have eyes and ears in Hogwarts to test Harry and Dumbledore and to know where he was stepping.",0,0

Wb-6fhfAn2I,We're so individualistic in our goals because this capitalist system has shaped us this way. We are overworked or believe we have to overwork ourselves to become successful. Success can only be quantified and only leaves us to becomr more materialistic. True success means finding a life with purpose and a finding a path which respects people and nature at all times.,1,0
Wb-6fhfAn2I,"We're fascinated by a certain sort of response to this film which says a variant of: this can't be true because sometimes I was happy and ate a lot. Or: it can't be true because it's just about biology. With respect, we entirely recognise the truth of these lines of argument. But this film, like many of our films, is focused on the emotional component of our behaviour and especially, the emotional relationship we build up with food when emotions with people become a little complicated. We're not saying that food doesn't taste nice; it tastes very nice indeed. We are saying that this niceness becomes all the more important when the rest of life is not showing its niceness to us. The same argument can be made around drugs. Cocaine and heroin can feel very nice indeed - but our susceptibility to this niceness grows acute when our lives are especially disconnected from others and in arduous phases.",5,4

Wb-6fhfAn2I,"I just want to preface with how much I appreciate the kind of insight this channel offers. But this video sounds incomplete on its own. Why do you suppose gluttony and emotional deficiencies are necessarily linked when there are so many other factors at play? Our biological bias for sweet/salty/fatty food, the advertising/monetization of our attention, the financial incentives of cheap calorically rich food. Devoting a whole episode on linking emotional deficiencies seems rather narrow as it would only apply to the times when we feel sad and neglected and treat those symptoms with food.

Wb-6fhfAn2I,okay except people do need food in order to survive.,0,0
Wb-6fhfAn2I,I love these videos but this one is the first one I have a real problem with. We eat to much bc we are addicted to sugar.  The modern industrial diet is loaded with cheap carbs that reek havoc on your metabolic hormones. The appetite is triggered not based on the body's caloric or nutritional needs but on its over-reliance on a completely unnatural amount of daily carbs to maintain blood sugar levels as insulin resistance increases over time. The epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes is not simply a psychological or emotional issue. Its all about biology and the miseducation we have all recieved about what our body really needs.,0,0
Wb-6fhfAn2I,"So true from my personal experience when I was doing well in work and actually like going there, sleep well, not stressed about anything and go to the gym every day it wasn't hard for me to eat well and less even though I used to be overweight I lost a lot during that time I was so much healthier.

I told her that I'm not the athletic type and she told that I should look after my body and that she can't understand this refusal. I agree with the School of Life on that I hate myself too much to do myself the honour of looking after my body. But then I'm a little sceptical.

Wb-6fhfAn2I,"To the people saying this video is wrong....it's not wrong it just isn't the whole story for everyone. None of us have perfect relationships across the board. There's one part of our lives concerning other people that will simply fail to measure up. Whether that's with our parents, our friends, a love, our co-workers...or even our ability to make good first impressions on complete strangers. There's something in our lives that will cause us to as others have said in the comment section, to eat our problems or Stress eat. A lot of the things we come to stress about are caused by other people or our failure to meet expectations. \\n\\nWhile the video wasn't wrong, it wasn't the beginning and ending as to why we eat so much. There are other reasons as well. imo a reason that's even bigger than this is, we eat so much because the sugar industry as complete control and pumps sugar into american foods. Even the meat. And we gobble it up because it FEELS good. Some people drink alcohol, others take drugs, others get high.....and many binge eat. All the same shit.",0,0

Wb-6fhfAn2I,"I don't like that this channel always tries to relate our issues to lack of love or affection. It sounds like the people who say gay people are gay because their parents didn't love them- for most it isn't true, and it's a terrible generalization of the problem which keeps us from looking any further because we think we already have the answer. Personally, I think I overeat because I was always told to finish all of my food. I end up throwing leftovers away if I have them because they get stale, or bland, or don't taste as good reheated, but I feel guilty if I throw away fresh food. I feel less guilty if I just eat it. I don't overeat because of a lack of love, I overeat because of a lack of discipline.",0,0

Some people may overeat during sad and depressing times but that's not the sole cause of overeating in all individuals. I'm personally on the skinny side and I've overeaten during some really happy times like when I ate at a buffet with my family, thanksgiving, Christmas. Finally, this video also cannot explain overeating in infants that later grow up and be obese as adults.",0,1
Wb-6fhfAn2I,"I really like this channel and the videos, because they are very relatable and strike true right away. However, they almost never propose any usable solutions or alternatives to solve these problems. Yes, heart to heart talk with your parent might be what you need but its not what is viable.

Wb-6fhfAn2I,"Because life is mainly about suffering, what matters the most is where you find consolation. And for all of us, the very  first consolation we have received in our lives,  came from the breast of our mother who fed us. Every time you cried in horror as a baby, it was immediately there and then you felt safe and peaceful again. I guess that's why we turn to food whenever we feel lost, lonely and helpless. But now as adults, the best form of consolation we can find is  connection.  Being connected to our inner world first, and then feeling close and connected to everyone around us.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this is much more difficult to get than your mother's breast! it doesn't come to you just like that  when you need it. You may love a lot of people, but still not feel truly safe or at home with them. But thank God there are other options available. You can read a lot of books, listen to beautiful songs,  and watch great movies to constantly remind yourself that indeed everyone is suffering the same, even if they don't always dare to talk about it. Just like you.  Literature, music and art give us an access to the inner lives of everyone. \\n\\nUnderstanding, tenderness, forgiveness, reconciliation and closeness aren't  always available out there, but what we can do is to keep cultivating them within us. If we offer them first, we may inspire others to open up and be kind to themselves and to everyone else too. \\n\\nBy the way here is a country song I love and as you can imagine, the thing about these tomatoes isn't indeed the fact that they taste so good,but that they give you the feeling of home....\\n\\n\\nPlant 'em in the spring, eat 'em in the summer\\nAll winter without 'em is a culinary bummer\\nI forget all about the sweatin' and the diggin'\\nEvery time I go out and pick me a big 'un\\n\\n\\nWhen I die don't bury me\\nIn a box in a cold dark cemetery\\nOut in the garden would be much better\\n'Cause I could be pushin' up a home grown tomatoes\\n\\n\\nHome grown tomatoes, home grown tomatoes\\nWhat'd life be without home grown tomatoes\\nOnly two things that money can't buy\\nThat's true love and home grown tomatoes\\n\\n\\nThank you so much for this valuable lesson and for the excellent animation. By the way I loved your menu! Tenderised maternal love sounds wonderful. But if it's not available, then that scoop of honeyed insight five times a day or so, with  a huge amount of melting compassion on top of it would be great :- )",0,2

ZtXkNMbjOEE,"Cam den & ReligionwhistleBlower, Here is how media and entertainment society brainwashed us. They have been showing us that it is ok to go all around the world to those poor countries and kill millions of their innocent people and take away their natural resources. They have been showing us that it is ok to kill 10 million Native Americans together with their buffalos. They have been showing us that black lives don’t matter. They showed us that it is ok to throw atomic bomb and kill innocent people. They took away the name of our Creator from the face of our nation and they let those illiterate preachers who worship idols mislead us, that is why the Angeles of the Almighty, the drives of the wind bring down 1900 tornados upon them every year plus floods, fires, and hurricanes, and mudslides. Our media have been showing us that fast foods are good for us, yet every year people are dying of cancers and many other diseases instead of a normal death. They have been showing us that chemical fertilizers are good, and they say spray your food with chemical poisons it is good for you. Our media have been showing us that polluting the air is ok and we don’t get lung cancer because of that. They have been promoting cigarettes; alcohol and gambling in order for us to die of lung cancers, accidents, family problems, and divorces. They have been promoting all kinds of sex, adulteries and homosexuality in order for us to get different diseases and aid killing 49 million so far. They have been showing us that killing our own people it is ok, that is how they have been promoting guns for all. They have been showing us that white color crimes are ok, that is why they do not charge those highly educated criminals. Everything our media have taught us is against the laws of our creator. You are right they have been hiding the awesome message of our creator based on mathematics ever since 40 some years ago. The crimes that media have committed are far greater than all of those criminals from the beginning of time combined. Leaving the system of our creator only brings down suffering and disasters upon us. Therefore, when the Almighty sends His next disaster just make sure that is the consequence of our own wrong doings, so do not complain. His law is, “Nothing happens to you if you follow the rules of our Creator”.",1,0

bxgFjzRW6EA,"Ben, I love the theory but what if all Barty Crouch JR did was superseded the original portkey? Maybe this is why, 1 this portkey worked twice and 2 like you said took them to the beginning when the first person found it in the middle. Now when Harry touches the cup for the second time the original portkey takes place. Just a thought. Maybe Voldermort had no endgame with this plot but had he succeeded killing Harry having all the spectators wait and wonder would have been a happy coincidence. The only other thing I wondered about your theory is the polyjuice potion. It takes a month to fully brew polyjuice potion as we all know. I feel this portion of the theory may be just a touch far fetched but I like it to much to really dive in and nit pick. So with that being said, I think Voldermort had no endgame with this plot. There would have been whispers about his return had Harry not came back but death was something all the participants were facing to begin with. It could have all been played off as a consequence of the Triwizard Tournament. I could be wrong but honestly I never saw this as a plot hole.",0,0

bxgFjzRW6EA,"I kind of came up with a Fantastic Beasts theory that I think is right up your guys' alley to address. It is as follows (originally sent as texts to my friends):\\nOkay, am I the only one who thought Grindlewald's comment to Newt at the end - Will we die, just a little? - was out of the blue and didn't really make sense? (Theories of Horcruxes - nonsensical, of course for many reasons, most involving Dumbledore - notwithstanding.) As far as I'm aware, it's not a quote from anything nor does it have any meaning within the known Potter-verse (I say known for a reason, we'll get to it in a sec). So why put it in (aside from having to give Johnny Depp lines)? Why would Grindlewald say it all and specifically to Newt? I have a couple of theories/evidences that could help explain this. So, we know that Newt travels a lot saving magical creatures. We know that he was a favorite of Dumbledore's when he was in school. His older brother fought in World War I while he was off doing something with some dragons. The ministry of magic is not  particularly fond of him, despite them being the ones who commissioned his book. He still has his wand despite being kicked out of Hogwarts. He has met, from the sound of it, multiple Obscurials aside from Credence and has been working to find a cure. Now, we know that Grindlewald has a strong connection to Dumbledore, and while we know the two of them fell out of touch, we don't know how out of touch. Since his teenage years with Dumbledore, Grindlewald has undoubtedly been traveling around the world too. His quest is first and foremost to find the Deathly Hallows (which he has one of already at this point since he stole it from Gregorovitch - this happens to be THE MOST POWERFUL WAND TO EVER HAVE EXISTED). But he's also on a quest for Wizard supremacy over muggles. This, in his mind, entails revealing the Wizarding community to muggles and then lead some kind of take-over. He almost certainly had some role in World War I trying to wreak havoc on the muggles (there's probably a Wonder Woman tie in there but that's a different discussion). His revealing of the magical community could probably be brought about by magical beasts - he may have been actively seeking them out at one point. His quest definitely led him to think of Obscurials as a way to reveal wizards (an idea that almost definitely came to him because of Ariana Dumbledore). He gradually grew until he was a huge threat to the ENTIRE WORLD of Wizards and constantly evaded capture (the newspapers at the beginning of the movie). And there's definitely a lot more to be revealed in the upcoming movies, which is where we come to the theory part and the reason I said the KNOWN Potter-verse earlier. What do all these little pieces of information that we've gathered mean? Well, Newt and Grindlewald were both traveling the world and were probably in a lot of the same places considering that they may have been looking for very similar things, albeit for very, very different reasons. Thusly, how hard is it to believe that they came face to face at some point in the past? There are a ridiculous amount of connections between the two and the odds of them NOT meeting at some point are considerably lower than the odds of them bumping into each other. Who's to say exactly what may have happened in this encounter - I don't think Newt is quite powerful enough to stop Grindlewald, especially if he's carrying the Elder Wand - but I think it could explain a few things. Newt seems very knowledgeable about Grindlewald's methods (interrogation scene) and Graves (Grindlewald) knows a lot about Newt (I mean, yeah, files and stuff, but how much info does MACUSA have on hand about a BRITISH wizard?) and he's very quick to sentence him to death - and yeah, that might be because Newt seemed to figure out his secret ID, but how would he figure it out so quick, and how would Grindlewald know that Newt knew and deem him a big enough liability that he needs to die? - as if he knows that Newt could cause problems. Basically, the entire interrogation scene makes a tad bit more sense with the perspective that they may have met. Which in turn lends some extra context for... well basically everything else in the movie, creating that much more depth to the story. And then there's what we started with: Will we die, just a little? It's not only the line that makes this theory seem likely, it's Newt's reaction. Or lack thereof. He doesn't seem confused or shocked or anything really. And while Newt isn't one to show a whole bunch of emotion, you'd think an out of context line like that would at least make him frown, right? Instead he just kind of nods like he's pondering the question. But it's not just that. It's like he's heard the words before and has more to think about in regard to them (like when you get a question at the beginning of class and then again at the end). I think that Grindlewald's words have a deeper meaning than we as the audience are led to believe, especially when spoken to Newt. To me, it seems like Newt had a run-in with Grindlewald sometime in the past that may have changed his life/behaviors/beliefs/world view (this may also tie in to Lita Lestrange and his relationship with her - or lack thereof in the movie). Sometime in that meeting, Grindlewald said something to Newt that included this question and context to go with it. And that will be explained in the future movies. That also would explain why this movie series about Newt is going to so heavily rely on Grindlewald's reign. Or why the timeline of Grindlewald's reign of power includes Newt so much. There's more of a connection between the two characters than we've been led to believe.",1,0
bxgFjzRW6EA,Can you make a theory about the sorting hat being able to see into the future? It seems to make sense of why it almost put Harry in Slytherin and when it does some prophesy type stuff in the 5th book. Might make for a good theory or discussion of some sort.,1,0
bxgFjzRW6EA,Just want to point out that in the book the maze is in the quidditch field so spectators are watching from in the quidditch stands but also they do the task in the evening so you still cant see much. You might be able to at least see the light from their wands possibly.,0,0
bxgFjzRW6EA,fan theory lord of the ring and harry potter universe are one in the same. My theory these worlds are connected but how you might ask ill break it down simply and sweet.the first thing that brought me to this theory is when i rewatch the lord of the ring. salron created the one ring to rule them all in doing so a piece of himself was also placed in the ring. when he was defeated he didnt die because the ring still had a piece of his soul on earth. who does that remind you of. tom riddle. the idea of the horcrux had to come from somewhere.Part two races. man breeding elves=wizards look like man magical roots from the elves. had to use wands because unable to tap in to magic fully like pure blood elves. dwarf(men) breeding with elves= trolls and house elf trolls are more Stern like the Dwarven people but both are very powerful magically gifted like the elves. orcs seem to have died out but maybe still small factions of them exist. its true that salron didnt have kill to make his horcrux but he was like a god spirit so that does not count. so what do u think,0,0

He couldn't remove any of the original magic of the charm only add to it.

bxgFjzRW6EA,I think the cup was the only authorized Portkey that would have worked in Hogwarts and was probably only enchanted to work when touched by one of the contestants which is where the binding magical contract part comes in so all Moodycould have done was added the location of the graveyard and thats why they needed Harry to win after that first touch the original location took effect,0,0

(Page 572)\\nThis got me thinking; could Dumbledore actually break out? Considering his extreme dislike and fear of dementors, his considerable amount of terrible memories and feelings (the way he reacts to drinking the liquid in the end of book 6), and the fact that he would not have a wand.

bxgFjzRW6EA,"0:23 -  Was it really necessary for Harry to win The Cup to kidnap him?\\nWell maybe it was. If you wanted to teleport him out of Hogwarts. Normally you cannot teleport out of Hogwarts. But it seems that portkeys can. We had seen Dumbledore using portkey to teleport Harry from Hogwarts to Burrow and from Ministry to Hogwarts (Fifth book). If any portkey can do that, then this whole Anti-teleportation Spell would be *useless* . But what if only *Headmaster* could create such portkey (because he is owner of Hogwarts)? If Dumbledore was supposed to put such type of portkey-spell on Cup to teleport winner from center of the maze to entrance of the maze and Crouch knew that, then maybe Voldemort figured out that if you put another portkey-spell *on the same object* then it would *still* ignore this Anti-teleportation Spell.\\nBut Crouch would have to wait until Dumbledore creates such portkey in first place. And probably he just did that in the very day of the Third Task.",1,0

Wb-6fhfAn2I,"We're fascinated by a certain sort of response to this film which says a variant of: this can't be true because sometimes I was happy and ate a lot. Or: it can't be true because it's just about biology. With respect, we entirely recognise the truth of these lines of argument. But this film, like many of our films, is focused on the emotional component of our behaviour and especially, the emotional relationship we build up with food when emotions with people become a little complicated. We're not saying that food doesn't taste nice; it tastes very nice indeed. We are saying that this niceness becomes all the more important when the rest of life is not showing its niceness to us. The same argument can be made around drugs. Cocaine and heroin can feel very nice indeed - but our susceptibility to this niceness grows acute when our lives are especially disconnected from others and in arduous phases.",16,4

I feel like this has some amount of fat shaming as  an undercurrent.Even if you are arguing  for health i find it difficult to say that  skinny or smaller people are any healthier than fatter people ,is just what types of food we consume, or even that being healthy is necessarily useful, or good in any way ?",0,0

Wb-6fhfAn2I,"To the people saying this video is wrong....it's not wrong it just isn't the whole story for everyone. None of us have perfect relationships across the board. There's one part of our lives concerning other people that will simply fail to measure up. Whether that's with our parents, our friends, a love, our co-workers...or even our ability to make good first impressions on complete strangers. There's something in our lives that will cause us to as others have said in the comment section, to eat our problems or Stress eat. A lot of the things we come to stress about are caused by other people or our failure to meet expectations. \\n\\nWhile the video wasn't wrong, it wasn't the beginning and ending as to why we eat so much. There are other reasons as well. imo a reason that's even bigger than this is, we eat so much because the sugar industry as complete control and pumps sugar into american foods. Even the meat. And we gobble it up because it FEELS good. Some people drink alcohol, others take drugs, others get high.....and many binge eat. All the same shit.",0,0

Wb-6fhfAn2I,"I just want to preface with how much I appreciate the kind of insight this channel offers. But this video sounds incomplete on its own. Why do you suppose gluttony and emotional deficiencies are necessarily linked when there are so many other factors at play? Our biological bias for sweet/salty/fatty food, the advertising/monetization of our attention, the financial incentives of cheap calorically rich food. Devoting a whole episode on linking emotional deficiencies seems rather narrow as it would only apply to the times when we feel sad and neglected and treat those symptoms with food. I guess I just answered my own question... Thanks!",0,0
Wb-6fhfAn2I,We're so individualistic in our goals because this capitalist system has shaped us this way. We are overworked or believe we have to overwork ourselves to become successful.

Wb-6fhfAn2I,okay except people do need food in order to survive.,0,0
Wb-6fhfAn2I,I love these videos but this one is the first one I have a real problem with. We eat to much bc we are addicted to sugar.  The modern industrial diet is loaded with cheap carbs that reek havoc on your metabolic hormones. The appetite is triggered not based on the body's caloric or nutritional needs but on its over-reliance on a completely unnatural amount of daily carbs to maintain blood sugar levels as insulin resistance increases over time. The epidemic of obesity and type 2 diabetes is not simply a psychological or emotional issue. Its all about biology and the miseducation we have all recieved about what our body really needs.,0,0
Wb-6fhfAn2I,"So true from my personal experience when I was doing well in work and actually like going there, sleep well, not stressed about anything and go to the gym every day it wasn't hard for me to eat well and less even though I used to be overweight I lost a lot during that time I was so much healthier. But now I'm starting a new business with tones of things to wary about, not spending much time with anyone I eat a lot and I'm always hungry.

When we work out together once in a while she notices that my body can't do the exercises she does quite as easily as she does. I told her that I'm not the athletic type and she told that I should look after my body and that she can't understand this refusal. I agree with the School of Life on that I hate myself too much to do myself the honour of looking after my body. But then I'm a little sceptical.

Some people may overeat during sad and depressing times but that's not the sole cause of overeating in all individuals. I'm personally on the skinny side and I've overeaten during some really happy times like when I ate at a buffet with my family, thanksgiving, Christmas. Finally, this video also cannot explain overeating in infants that later grow up and be obese as adults.",0,1
Wb-6fhfAn2I,this is so bullshit  sugar makes your glycogen in your blood go very high and then go very low so you crave more sugar as well as sugar doesnt fill you at all and oil doesnt satiate your at all thats cause of obesity being addicted to oils and sugar,0,2
Wb-6fhfAn2I,"Because life is mainly about suffering, what matters the most is where you find consolation. And for all of us, the very  first consolation we have received in our lives,  came from the breast of our mother who fed us. Every time you cried in horror as a baby, it was immediately there and then you felt safe and peaceful again. I guess that's why we turn to food whenever we feel lost, lonely and helpless. But now as adults, the best form of consolation we can find is  connection.  Being connected to our inner world first, and then feeling close and connected to everyone around us.\\n\\nUnfortunately, this is much more difficult to get than your mother's breast! it doesn't come to you just like that  when you need it. You may love a lot of people, but still not feel truly safe or at home with them. But thank God there are other options available. You can read a lot of books, listen to beautiful songs,  and watch great movies to constantly remind yourself that indeed everyone is suffering the same, even if they don't always dare to talk about it. Just like you.  Literature, music and art give us an access to the inner lives of everyone. \\n\\nUnderstanding, tenderness, forgiveness, reconciliation and closeness aren't  always available out there, but what we can do is to keep cultivating them within us. If we offer them first, we may inspire others to open up and be kind to themselves and to everyone else too. \\n\\nBy the way here is a country song I love and as you can imagine, the thing about these tomatoes isn't indeed the fact that they taste so good,but that they give you the feeling of home....\\n\\n\\nPlant 'em in the spring, eat 'em in the summer\\nAll winter without 'em is a culinary bummer\\nI forget all about the sweatin' and the diggin'\\nEvery time I go out and pick me a big 'un\\n\\n\\nWhen I die don't bury me\\nIn a box in a cold dark cemetery\\nOut in the garden would be much better\\n'Cause I could be pushin' up a home grown tomatoes\\n\\n\\nHome grown tomatoes, home grown tomatoes\\nWhat'd life be without home grown tomatoes\\nOnly two things that money can't buy\\nThat's true love and home grown tomatoes\\n\\n\\nThank you so much for this valuable lesson and for the excellent animation. By the way I loved your menu! Tenderised maternal love sounds wonderful. But if it's not available, then that scoop of honeyed insight five times a day or so, with  a huge amount of melting compassion on top of it would be great :- )",0,2
Wb-6fhfAn2I,"I really like this channel and the videos, because they are very relatable and strike true right away. However, they almost never propose any usable solutions or alternatives to solve these problems. Yes, heart to heart talk with your parent might be what you need but its not what is viable. If you could just go and have the talk your soul craves you wouldn't be overeating for some 20 years.",0,1

J_ub7Etch2U,LGBTQ PRIDE is that Sam Smith boyfriend. He so cute. This song so sad. From Adele sad songs. To. Same Smith this song. Beat it. Even tho Sam Smith gay I'm gay to. Even tho you love with your boyfriend and boyfriend. Or girlfriend girlfriend. Or boyfriend and girlfriend. Even tho there moving or guys have to break. This last time to spend time with other. You just wanna hold your partner and don't let go. All love you to shared together threw good times.  And bad times. This is perfect. Song. You know you will always love your partner. It's hard to good to say goodbye. relationship hurts lorde fan as well she got awesome sad songs. All I'm saying is there be A part of time where you had A bad break up. Or partner moving. Don't know when you ever see him again. Who ever you with. Just know not good bye. You will still be with me. Always love your partner. The video could be lot thing parents don't accept theme. There force to break up. Love you who wanna love. Be who you wanna be with. Let's all get along. Love one another. Not fight or hate on someone sexually. What I don't get is. How people say they have gay friends. When there son or daughter comes out tell you I'm gay. I'm bisexual. I'm A lesbians. Or daughter tells you she want to. Be A guy. Or son tells you he want to be girl. Don't push them away. Love them or don't say it's in the Bible. God hate LGBTQ PEOPLE. until god comes to my hometown knocks on my door. Tell me I'm going hell and I'm not accepted to haven then I believe it. Other then that it's A meith. Sam Smith did A freaky fantastic job on this video. LGBTQ PRIDE GAY PRIDE. RAINBOW PRIDE. stay strong people who in A bad relationship stay strong. Or had to break up. You will find A nice person who will treat you right. You will find happiness. I do have kik snap chat and facebook and twitter and instagram. If you wanna chat. Love is love. 💏💑👨‍👨‍👧👨‍👨‍👦‍👦👨‍👨‍👦👩‍❤️‍👩👨‍❤️‍👨👩‍❤️‍💋‍👩👨‍❤️‍💋‍👨👩‍👩‍👦👩‍👩‍👦‍👦👩‍👩‍👧👭👬❤💙💚💖💕💓💞🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈🌈,0,2

bxgFjzRW6EA,"Unless i'm missing something important, Harry's participation in the Triwizard tournament and the complicated mess of ensuring he touches a the cup portkey should not have been necessary for the villains' scheme. There were ample opportunities for Crouch Jr to abduct Harry at almost any point during his 4th year, especially at night when roaming the castle alone. He knows Harry has an invisibility cloak and can see through it. And in the book, he obtains the Marauders Map as well (almost having his identity discovered due to the map). That specific moment he gets the map was a great opportunity to abduct Harry. He could knock Harry out and carry him right out the front door and outside the area of enchantment, using the cloak to hide and the map to ensure he doesn't get caught.

bxgFjzRW6EA,"0:23 -  Was it really necessary for Harry to win The Cup to kidnap him?\\nWell maybe it was. If you wanted to teleport him out of Hogwarts. Normally you cannot teleport out of Hogwarts. But it seems that portkeys can. We had seen Dumbledore using portkey to teleport Harry from Hogwarts to Burrow and from Ministry to Hogwarts (Fifth book). If any portkey can do that, then this whole Anti-teleportation Spell would be *useless* . But what if only *Headmaster* could create such portkey (because he is owner of Hogwarts)? If Dumbledore was supposed to put such type of portkey-spell on Cup to teleport winner from center of the maze to entrance of the maze and Crouch knew that, then maybe Voldemort figured out that if you put another portkey-spell *on the same object* then it would *still* ignore this Anti-teleportation Spell.\\nBut Crouch would have to wait until Dumbledore creates such portkey in first place. And probably he just did that in the very day of the Third Task.",1,0

bxgFjzRW6EA,"Ben, I love the theory but what if all Barty Crouch JR did was superseded the original portkey? Maybe this is why, 1 this portkey worked twice and 2 like you said took them to the beginning when the first person found it in the middle. Now when Harry touches the cup for the second time the original portkey takes place. Just a thought. Maybe Voldermort had no endgame with this plot but had he succeeded killing Harry having all the spectators wait and wonder would have been a happy coincidence. The only other thing I wondered about your theory is the polyjuice potion. It takes a month to fully brew polyjuice potion as we all know. I feel this portion of the theory may be just a touch far fetched but I like it to much to really dive in and nit pick. So with that being said, I think Voldermort had no endgame with this plot. There would have been whispers about his return had Harry not came back but death was something all the participants were facing to begin with. It could have all been played off as a consequence of the Triwizard Tournament. I could be wrong but honestly I never saw this as a plot hole.",0,0

bxgFjzRW6EA,fan theory lord of the ring and harry potter universe are one in the same. My theory these worlds are connected but how you might ask ill break it down simply and sweet.the first thing that brought me to this theory is when i rewatch the lord of the ring. salron created the one ring to rule them all in doing so a piece of himself was also placed in the ring. when he was defeated he didnt die because the ring still had a piece of his soul on earth. who does that remind you of. tom riddle. the idea of the horcrux had to come from somewhere.Part two races. man breeding elves=wizards look like man magical roots from the elves. had to use wands because unable to tap in to magic fully like pure blood elves. dwarf(men) breeding with elves= trolls and house elf trolls are more Stern like the Dwarven people but both are very powerful magically gifted like the elves. orcs seem to have died out but maybe still small factions of them exist. its true that salron didnt have kill to make his horcrux but he was like a god spirit so that does not count. so what do u think,0,0

bxgFjzRW6EA,"I kind of came up with a Fantastic Beasts theory that I think is right up your guys' alley to address. It is as follows (originally sent as texts to my friends):\\nOkay, am I the only one who thought Grindlewald's comment to Newt at the end - Will we die, just a little? - was out of the blue and didn't really make sense? (Theories of Horcruxes - nonsensical, of course for many reasons, most involving Dumbledore - notwithstanding.) As far as I'm aware, it's not a quote from anything nor does it have any meaning within the known Potter-verse (I say known for a reason, we'll get to it in a sec). So why put it in (aside from having to give Johnny Depp lines)? Why would Grindlewald say it all and specifically to Newt? I have a couple of theories/evidences that could help explain this. So, we know that Newt travels a lot saving magical creatures. We know that he was a favorite of Dumbledore's when he was in school. His older brother fought in World War I while he was off doing something with some dragons. The ministry of magic is not  particularly fond of him, despite them being the ones who commissioned his book. He still has his wand despite being kicked out of Hogwarts. He has met, from the sound of it, multiple Obscurials aside from Credence and has been working to find a cure. Now, we know that Grindlewald has a strong connection to Dumbledore, and while we know the two of them fell out of touch, we don't know how out of touch. Since his teenage years with Dumbledore, Grindlewald has undoubtedly been traveling around the world too. His quest is first and foremost to find the Deathly Hallows (which he has one of already at this point since he stole it from Gregorovitch - this happens to be THE MOST POWERFUL WAND TO EVER HAVE EXISTED). But he's also on a quest for Wizard supremacy over muggles. This, in his mind, entails revealing the Wizarding community to muggles and then lead some kind of take-over. He almost certainly had some role in World War I trying to wreak havoc on the muggles (there's probably a Wonder Woman tie in there but that's a different discussion). His revealing of the magical community could probably be brought about by magical beasts - he may have been actively seeking them out at one point. His quest definitely led him to think of Obscurials as a way to reveal wizards (an idea that almost definitely came to him because of Ariana Dumbledore). He gradually grew until he was a huge threat to the ENTIRE WORLD of Wizards and constantly evaded capture (the newspapers at the beginning of the movie). And there's definitely a lot more to be revealed in the upcoming movies, which is where we come to the theory part and the reason I said the KNOWN Potter-verse earlier. What do all these little pieces of information that we've gathered mean? Well, Newt and Grindlewald were both traveling the world and were probably in a lot of the same places considering that they may have been looking for very similar things, albeit for very, very different reasons. Thusly, how hard is it to believe that they came face to face at some point in the past? There are a ridiculous amount of connections between the two and the odds of them NOT meeting at some point are considerably lower than the odds of them bumping into each other. Who's to say exactly what may have happened in this encounter - I don't think Newt is quite powerful enough to stop Grindlewald, especially if he's carrying the Elder Wand - but I think it could explain a few things. Newt seems very knowledgeable about Grindlewald's methods (interrogation scene) and Graves (Grindlewald) knows a lot about Newt (I mean, yeah, files and stuff, but how much info does MACUSA have on hand about a BRITISH wizard?) and he's very quick to sentence him to death - and yeah, that might be because Newt seemed to figure out his secret ID, but how would he figure it out so quick, and how would Grindlewald know that Newt knew and deem him a big enough liability that he needs to die? - as if he knows that Newt could cause problems. Basically, the entire interrogation scene makes a tad bit more sense with the perspective that they may have met. Which in turn lends some extra context for... well basically everything else in the movie, creating that much more depth to the story. And then there's what we started with: Will we die, just a little? It's not only the line that makes this theory seem likely, it's Newt's reaction. Or lack thereof. He doesn't seem confused or shocked or anything really. And while Newt isn't one to show a whole bunch of emotion, you'd think an out of context line like that would at least make him frown, right? Instead he just kind of nods like he's pondering the question. But it's not just that. It's like he's heard the words before and has more to think about in regard to them (like when you get a question at the beginning of class and then again at the end). I think that Grindlewald's words have a deeper meaning than we as the audience are led to believe, especially when spoken to Newt. To me, it seems like Newt had a run-in with Grindlewald sometime in the past that may have changed his life/behaviors/beliefs/world view (this may also tie in to Lita Lestrange and his relationship with her - or lack thereof in the movie). Sometime in that meeting, Grindlewald said something to Newt that included this question and context to go with it. And that will be explained in the future movies. That also would explain why this movie series about Newt is going to so heavily rely on Grindlewald's reign. Or why the timeline of Grindlewald's reign of power includes Newt so much. There's more of a connection between the two characters than we've been led to believe.",1,0

I said something. I reached out and now I'm in a bad place because she wants me to talk and I know it was a mistake to reach out. I can't talk to her. I was the toxic person. I'm sure I still am. But it's starting to feel like she is. But after reaching out like that I can't cut her off again because that would just be rude. But that's all I want to do. What am I supposed to do. It's all my fault but I just want peace. I just wanted us to be in talking terms. But now she's upset at me for feeling guilty about her and I'm so freaking confused,0,0

Z-LmHjkN2EU,"(((Homosexuality is an abomination before a Holy God. If they dont repent and stop doing this sinful act they will not inherit the kingdom of God. Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \\nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\\n\\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\\n\\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\\n\\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\\n\\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\\n\\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\\n\\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\\n\\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\\n\\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\\n\\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\\n\\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\\n\\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\\n\\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \\n\\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\\n\\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",0,0

Z-LmHjkN2EU,"(((Homosexuality is an abomination before a Holy God. If they dont repent and stop doing this sinful act they will not inherit the kingdom of God. Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \\nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\\n\\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\\n\\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\\n\\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\\n\\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\\n\\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\\n\\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\\n\\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\\n\\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\\n\\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\\n\\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\\n\\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\\n\\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \\n\\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\\n\\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",0,0

My only objection would be that as beautiful and charismatic Gisele is, she's also a terrible actress, what you can see for yourself - although I do not recommend it - in a movie called Taxi (which also features Queen Latifah). It was so bad that she has admitted in various interviews since then have given up attempts of acting again.

There will be a new framework that comes into effect post brexit.\\n\\n...

And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \\nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\\n\\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\\n\\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\\n\\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\\n\\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\\n\\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\\n\\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\\n\\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\\n\\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\\n\\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\\n\\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\\n\\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\\n\\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \\n\\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\\n\\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",0,0

kEUfrSxTQ1s,i do feel sorry for the player and the kid and NOW let this be an eye opener for pro baseball maybe should have some protection i mean think about it NFL they got a net behind the field goal so someone dont get smacked in the face also to get the ball back faster.

kEUfrSxTQ1s,She’s in a stable condition. It’s going to be a long process” according to the family. I agree there should be more netting around the home plate area but the parents/guardians should've accepted the risks involved when choosing their seats AND could have been protecting there child better. The latter may not have been possible but HRs and Foul balls are not something new in this sport. I hope to see more protection from the MLB and teams first and foremost,1,1

lUFpahcEOX8,"It is quite interesting when Brexiters are telling the stories of Grate Global Britain. They all say about how it will be once UK will get there, but no one ever said how to get there. I am Polish citizen living in UK and all my wealth is in Uk so well being of this country is quite important to me. I would love to hear how are you guys going to get there (Global Britains)  after leaving EU. My wealth is at stake here and I am quite worried. Here is why: Britain has no trade deals with other countries apart those which are via EU. Britain so far has no prospects to get real trade deal with any country on day one after leaving EU. If you revert to WTO you will become less competitive then others which means others will find new suppliers. On top of that you can't really accommondate more customs problems due to lack of manpower therefore you won't be able to import as much as you want (less supplies mean higher prices and bigger inflation). If you go zero tariffs on import to offset the customs incapacity then business will get real incentive to go to EU (I am sure you can imagine why and I don't have to explain that). That lack of a trade deal on the day one after Brexit means you will do virtually no business and that will take months. Any one can imagine what can do month of lights out to any business and it can do the same to whole country. The transition period is the first smart thing UK did after voting for Brexit. Please fill free to explain to me how you will prosper after EU so I can be at ease that my and your wealth is safe :)",0,0
lUFpahcEOX8,"It's a pretty clever tactic\\n\\nShe is not asking for an extension, not on the table.\\n\\nShe's not asking for transitional period.  Not on the table.\\n\\nWe leave 29 march 2019.  From that time EU citizens will have to register in the UK.  Like non EU countries.\\n\\nThe implementation period she's proposing is post brexit, to establish institutions and processes to fit a deal.\\n\\nAt the end of march 2019 we will leave the EU.\\n\\nShe's deliberately avoided using transition because there will not be a transition.  There will be a new framework that comes into effect post brexit.\\n\\n...  The EU now have a decision\\n\\n\\nIf they reject her proposal, we have grounds to set our own exit date and break off talks.  We can cite EU intransigence.\\n\\n\\nIf they agree then they cannot vascilate over trade talks.\\n\\nEither way, she has taken charge of the situation.\\n\\nShe reiterated that no deal is better than a bad deal.\\n\\nThe EU have no wriggle room now and they will have to find another way to blame UK because she said we will meet our obligations.  So that should be the end of the bill issue. She said we would continue paying for the current EU be budget round.  In return she wants an implementation period during which we are not EU members.\\n\\nPersonally I hope the EU reject it because that would mean her only response would be to say that further talks on trade are pointless.\\n\\nBasically it puts the EU on the spot.",0,0

Such a waste of space, a failed, failed home secretary who at best should have pursued some career as a civil servant has the temerity of speaking on behalf of our Nation. Shame on us all for giving the tories the opportunity to finish the job started by Chamberlain in Munich: we prostrate before Germany, the undiscussed master of their nazi 4th reich called EU, the very denial of democracy (rule by the people for the people).

lUFpahcEOX8,"Britain is washed up. We will end up staying in the EU. All this is just a waste of time and money. It was doomed from the start. With the majority of the House of Commons and House of Lords being Remainers there is no way Brexit would ever come true. If politicians were honest, which we know they're not, they would have said immediately after the referendum result, that they felt we should remain and the result would be treated as simply public opinion at that point int time. However, too frightened to be honest they pretend to respect the referendum result and find a more subtle way of getting their own way. This way it looks as though they are implementing the referendum result when they are going out of their way to stall Brexit and get the worst possible deal from the EU, so when they announce another referendum in 4 years or so, they know the deal will be so bad that they will get the majority vote to remain. Then when ask to remain in the EU we will get an even worse deal than we have now and will be looked upon as the 'bad boys' of the EU as we had the cheek to vote to come out. No other EU members will ever agree with anything the UK requests. We should never have joined this corrupt power grabbing bete noire in the first place. I sometimes wonder if Europe would have been better if Hitler had not been defeated. I very much doubt if would have been any worse than it is now.",0,0

kEUfrSxTQ1s,i do feel sorry for the player and the kid and NOW let this be an eye opener for pro baseball maybe should have some protection i mean think about it NFL they got a net behind the field goal so someone dont get smacked in the face also to get the ball back faster.

kEUfrSxTQ1s,How old was this girl?  I think kids under 2 are free.  They say shes doing OK but as a parent you should be paying extra attention sitting down there with a small child.  Bring a glove just in case maybe.  Yankees charge and arm and a leg for those tickets you think they will sell as much with a netting blocking your view.  All about money.,1,4
kEUfrSxTQ1s,Anybody know how the girl is doing?,1,3
kEUfrSxTQ1s,She’s in a stable condition. It’s going to be a long process” according to the family. I agree there should be more netting around the home plate area but the parents/guardians should've accepted the risks involved when choosing their seats AND could have been protecting there child better. The latter may not have been possible but HRs and Foul balls are not something new in this sport. I hope to see more protection from the MLB and teams first and foremost,1,1

lUFpahcEOX8,"Britain is washed up. We will end up staying in the EU. All this is just a waste of time and money. It was doomed from the start. With the majority of the House of Commons and House of Lords being Remainers there is no way Brexit would ever come true. If politicians were honest, which we know they're not, they would have said immediately after the referendum result, that they felt we should remain and the result would be treated as simply public opinion at that point int time. However, too frightened to be honest they pretend to respect the referendum result and find a more subtle way of getting their own way. This way it looks as though they are implementing the referendum result when they are going out of their way to stall Brexit and get the worst possible deal from the EU, so when they announce another referendum in 4 years or so, they know the deal will be so bad that they will get the majority vote to remain. Then when ask to remain in the EU we will get an even worse deal than we have now and will be looked upon as the 'bad boys' of the EU as we had the cheek to vote to come out. No other EU members will ever agree with anything the UK requests. We should never have joined this corrupt power grabbing bete noire in the first place.

I am Polish citizen living in UK and all my wealth is in Uk so well being of this country is quite important to me. I would love to hear how are you guys going to get there (Global Britains)  after leaving EU. My wealth is at stake here and I am quite worried. Here is why: Britain has no trade deals with other countries apart those which are via EU. Britain so far has no prospects to get real trade deal with any country on day one after leaving EU. If you revert to WTO you will become less competitive then others which means others will find new suppliers. On top of that you can't really accommondate more customs problems due to lack of manpower therefore you won't be able to import as much as you want (less supplies mean higher prices and bigger inflation). If you go zero tariffs on import to offset the customs incapacity then business will get real incentive to go to EU (I am sure you can imagine why and I don't have to explain that). That lack of a trade deal on the day one after Brexit means you will do virtually no business and that will take months. Any one can imagine what can do month of lights out to any business and it can do the same to whole country. The transition period is the first smart thing UK did after voting for Brexit.

Shame on us all for giving the tories the opportunity to finish the job started by Chamberlain in Munich: we prostrate before Germany, the undiscussed master of their nazi 4th reich called EU, the very denial of democracy (rule by the people for the people).

lUFpahcEOX8,"Britain is washed up. We will end up staying in the EU. All this is just a waste of time and money. It was doomed from the start. With the majority of the House of Commons and House of Lords being Remainers there is no way Brexit would ever come true. If politicians were honest, which we know they're not, they would have said immediately after the referendum result, that they felt we should remain and the result would be treated as simply public opinion at that point int time. However, too frightened to be honest they pretend to respect the referendum result and find a more subtle way of getting their own way. This way it looks as though they are implementing the referendum result when they are going out of their way to stall Brexit and get the worst possible deal from the EU, so when they announce another referendum in 4 years or so, they know the deal will be so bad that they will get the majority vote to remain. Then when ask to remain in the EU we will get an even worse deal than we have now and will be looked upon as the 'bad boys' of the EU as we had the cheek to vote to come out. No other EU members will ever agree with anything the UK requests. We should never have joined this corrupt power grabbing bete noire in the first place.

lUFpahcEOX8,"It is quite interesting when Brexiters are telling the stories of Grate Global Britain. They all say about how it will be once UK will get there, but no one ever said how to get there. I am Polish citizen living in UK and all my wealth is in Uk so well being of this country is quite important to me. I would love to hear how are you guys going to get there (Global Britains)  after leaving EU. My wealth is at stake here and I am quite worried. Here is why: Britain has no trade deals with other countries apart those which are via EU. Britain so far has no prospects to get real trade deal with any country on day one after leaving EU. If you revert to WTO you will become less competitive then others which means others will find new suppliers. On top of that you can't really accommondate more customs problems due to lack of manpower therefore you won't be able to import as much as you want (less supplies mean higher prices and bigger inflation). If you go zero tariffs on import to offset the customs incapacity then business will get real incentive to go to EU (I am sure you can imagine why and I don't have to explain that). That lack of a trade deal on the day one after Brexit means you will do virtually no business and that will take months. Any one can imagine what can do month of lights out to any business and it can do the same to whole country. The transition period is the first smart thing UK did after voting for Brexit. Please fill free to explain to me how you will prosper after EU so I can be at ease that my and your wealth is safe :)",0,1

2jtDZXbN-_c,but beans are healthier for you. Nutrition facts. org,8,0
2jtDZXbN-_c,I've always thought a good restaurant idea was a place that rewarded you for not ordering meat. Meat would still be on the menu but a certain discount would be given if your entire meal was free of meat. It could be as little as 5% off or as much as 15%.  It would make a small but significant difference because you would change buyer habits which would have an effect on the amount of plants and meat would be ordered. More plants being ordered means less industrial slaughter going to dinner plates.,17,2
2jtDZXbN-_c,Eat less meat!,30,5
2jtDZXbN-_c,He didn't even mention how much healthier we would all be!,3,0

2jtDZXbN-_c,"I think that this transition from one person will not outweigh the rest of the worlds eating standards.. that is, if they even have the luxury to make such a drastic life overhaul. Correct me if i’m wrong, but the individuals choice in healthier eating cannot supersede the reality that the rest of the world would need to chime in as well for a drastic impact. I might boldly add that it’s a feel good measure for the individual..",0,0

2jtDZXbN-_c,Yes but the dangers of eating just beans instead of beef can best be illustrated by watching the campfire scene in the movie Blazing Saddles.,0,0
2jtDZXbN-_c,so stop eating beef... means we no longer kill the cows so they just produce methane constantly till they die naturally? makes sense,0,0

Maybe do a longer form vid or article really digging into this? I'd watch/read it.",2,3

2jtDZXbN-_c,"I hate this false narrative about ghg emissions from livestock. The carbon that livestock emit into the atmosphere isn't the same as that emitted by burning fossil fuels. Fossil fuels contain carbon that has been trapped in the earth for hundreds of millions of years.

2jtDZXbN-_c,Eat less meat!,31,6
2jtDZXbN-_c,I've always thought a good restaurant idea was a place that rewarded you for not ordering meat. Meat would still be on the menu but a certain discount would be given if your entire meal was free of meat. It could be as little as 5% off or as much as 15%.  It would make a small but significant difference because you would change buyer habits which would have an effect on the amount of plants and meat would be ordered. More plants being ordered means less industrial slaughter going to dinner plates.,18,3

Vh2WX2JNIFo,"Hey Eva, I honestly know how to help you. The same thing started up with my coworker in Hermosa Beach, CA she is a bartender and often gets home around 3am on busy nights. She'd come home to find all of her crosses in her apartment flipped over or scratched on her back and legs. It was unexplainable. She was so scared to fall asleep at night and would have vivid nightmares regularly. She randomly told me about it and I managed to get her parchment paper and a white candle blessed with some holy water before lighting it. I went to a local botanica (a Latin American cultural store) and got it blessed by the shaman there that makes the candles. He told her to burn the parchment paper and light it with the arm closest to her heart I believe it's the left? And slowly burn the parchment paper into the wick while reciting any prayer that made you feel safe and strong. He told her to let the candle burn completely only turning it off when unattended and always relighting it with the left arm and praying again. Once the candle burned all the way through she told me she instantly felt a lighter presence in the air and it's never bothered her again! She still lives in the same apartment. This happened around 2 years ago. The store is a bright blue building on Manchester & Broadway across the street from a Bank of America right off of the Florence exit on the 110 freeway! Please check them out and ask the young male employee for assistance! He speaks perfect English and is extremely knowledgeable in the paranormal and benefits of these blessed candles and oils. Good luck! xx",0,0

2jtDZXbN-_c,Eat less meat!,32,7
2jtDZXbN-_c,I've always thought a good restaurant idea was a place that rewarded you for not ordering meat. Meat would still be on the menu but a certain discount would be given if your entire meal was free of meat. It could be as little as 5% off or as much as 15%.  It would make a small but significant difference because you would change buyer habits which would have an effect on the amount of plants and meat would be ordered. More plants being ordered means less industrial slaughter going to dinner plates.,18,4

2jtDZXbN-_c,Yes but the dangers of eating just beans instead of beef can best be illustrated by watching the campfire scene in the movie Blazing Saddles.,1,1

Maybe do a longer form vid or article really digging into this? I'd watch/read it.",2,4

2jtDZXbN-_c,"I hate this false narrative about ghg emissions from livestock. The carbon that livestock emit into the atmosphere isn't the same as that emitted by burning fossil fuels. Fossil fuels contain carbon that has been trapped in the earth for hundreds of millions of years.

Islam will take over in a generation or two in Britian. But not Japan. Their leaders at least protect their borders and preserved their culture. Their kids aren't being raped by Pakistani gangs as they are all over Britian. \n\nAnd its just sick how the Royal Family....does nothing. They do nothing to defend Britian. Hilariously they join their military which defends everywhere but their own nation. But that's how globalism works. Globalist tools secure trade and leave borders open.,0,0

8I8G5XQI9_w,"I love the new puppet! I Also love the concept of the puppet playing on drum pads. However, when the bug puppet's jumping side to side constantly, it looks like you're just moving a still puppet left and right when it's supposed to look like the puppet is moving by himself. Other than that, I think the video was perfect.",0,0
8I8G5XQI9_w,"Loved it! I just thought that you should jump less and step more into the pad. When you are just jumping on the pad, the puppet gets out of life, there is no personality on him. On the other hand, its amazing when he steps side by side, when the bug is looking  around, every movement, but not the constant jumping\\n.",0,0

8I8G5XQI9_w,"I thought of a name for the bug. Since he's so agile and has excellent rhythm you should name him Jiggy Bug, because as he's dancing he's getting jiggy with it! OT, since the puppet is not ergonomic do you feel a strain in your forearms?",0,0

Really came a live for me, though, I do know why u needed to do it but if feel you should establish the  character messing around with the red buttons on the side as u did for the pads. It took me out of it a cupple times and I feel if u added something in that may help. Also I loved how the character exited, vary life like! the music was pretty great as well.

Other than that, I think the video was perfect.",0,0

Other than that, I think the video was perfect.",0,0
8I8G5XQI9_w,"Loved it! I just thought that you should jump less and step more into the pad. When you are just jumping on the pad, the puppet gets out of life, there is no personality on him.

ckWQt6cKCx8,"I've always hated the use of big names for voice actors. I first noticed it in Shrek and by Shrek 3 it was just a gimmick to promote a crappy movie: Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake were dating, so the latter voice acted in the movie. It didn't make the writing not suck. Compare those regular actors to voice acting legends like Hank Azaria or John Dimaggio too - those guys can do anything. Dimaggio was Bender in Futurama, Wakka in Final Fantasy X, and Jake in Adventure Time. He's massively talented and incredibly diverse. Few regular big name actors have the ability to use a voice other than their own (though Jason Segel isn't too bad). I feel like using big names has overshadowed these amazing talents and they aren't usually as good as the trained voice actors.",0,0

ckWQt6cKCx8,"the voice actor should only matter if their voice talent is great. Eddie Murphy, Jack Black, Mike Myers, Jim Carrey, John Goodman, Gilbert Gottfried, Mark Harmon, James Woods, and the late Robin Williams are prime examples of actors whos' voice roles are not only recognizable, but also well trained and full of talent. When a famous actor is also a talented voice actor like Mike Myers or the late Robin Williams, and has a wide variety of voices to add to the character they portray while coupled with good animation, you reach a point where the character often takes precedence over the actor and while you certainly know who is voicing the character you also recognize the particular role they are playing apart from their many other roles. Someone like Dwayne Johnson may be a popular actor, but outside of the singing I would not recognize his role in Moana from a voice playback of the Scorpion King because he has no voice talent.",0,0

I think this might be a bit better because you don't think of the actor went you're watching the show (like what you mentioned with Shrek) because you only really see their faces in interviews and you don't even think of other characters they've done before because they do this all the time and work on changing their voices from show to show so they match the character making it almost a different art form all together,0,0

Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \\nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\\n\\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\\n\\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\\n\\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\\n\\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\\n\\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\\n\\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\\n\\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\\n\\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\\n\\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\\n\\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\\n\\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\\n\\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \\n\\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\\n\\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",0,0

In fact, these are the types of videos that make regular YouTube viewers think that YouTuber's jobs are easy, because let's be honest here - they think that our 20 minute videos only took 20 minutes to make. Instead, they usually take much longer. \\n\\nEither way, thanks for this beautiful like to dislike ratio.

Part of what motivates them to do this is the desire to protect themselves from a perceived danger. The other part of this is that people know that politicians will use this even to try and restrict access to guns so it makes people think they'd better buy now before they lose the opportunity.

ckWQt6cKCx8,"I've always hated the use of big names for voice actors. I first noticed it in Shrek and by Shrek 3 it was just a gimmick to promote a crappy movie: Cameron Diaz and Justin Timberlake were dating, so the latter voice acted in the movie. It didn't make the writing not suck. Compare those regular actors to voice acting legends like Hank Azaria or John Dimaggio too - those guys can do anything. Dimaggio was Bender in Futurama, Wakka in Final Fantasy X, and Jake in Adventure Time. He's massively talented and incredibly diverse. Few regular big name actors have the ability to use a voice other than their own (though Jason Segel isn't too bad). I feel like using big names has overshadowed these amazing talents and they aren't usually as good as the trained voice actors.",0,0

ckWQt6cKCx8,"the voice actor should only matter if their voice talent is great. Eddie Murphy, Jack Black, Mike Myers, Jim Carrey, John Goodman, Gilbert Gottfried, Mark Harmon, James Woods, and the late Robin Williams are prime examples of actors whos' voice roles are not only recognizable, but also well trained and full of talent. When a famous actor is also a talented voice actor like Mike Myers or the late Robin Williams, and has a wide variety of voices to add to the character they portray while coupled with good animation, you reach a point where the character often takes precedence over the actor and while you certainly know who is voicing the character you also recognize the particular role they are playing apart from their many other roles. Someone like Dwayne Johnson may be a popular actor, but outside of the singing I would not recognize his role in Moana from a voice playback of the Scorpion King because he has no voice talent.",0,0

MiZCudqoFAU,"Since the makers of this video who paid YouTube to get on the trending page won't tell you, I will. Gun stocks rise because people are motivated to buy guns after a mass shooting. Part of what motivates them to do this is the desire to protect themselves from a perceived danger. The other part of this is that people know that politicians will use this even to try and restrict access to guns so it makes people think they'd better buy now before they lose the opportunity. Naturally, when sales go up, the companies do better. When the companies do better, their stock rises because more people see it as a good investment.",0,0

Obviously we should be spending 10 seconds of our life on fake news, instead of a video that you could've made titled Oh shit, Shooting occured, plz help those in need.\\n\\nI'm quite curious as to why your video editor didn't actually make a video, I literally could've made this video in 10 seconds exactly. In fact, these are the types of videos that make regular YouTube viewers think that YouTuber's jobs are easy, because let's be honest here - they think that our 20 minute videos only took 20 minutes to make. Instead, they usually take much longer. \\n\\nEither way, thanks for this beautiful like to dislike ratio.

But throughout it all, I never stopped loving her because I knew deep down there was a beautiful person in there who was just trying to find herself. Even when she received a lot of criticism by the media for her music, choice of clothing, and actions at the VMAs. There is something so special and endearing about her -  don't know what it is, but I can definitely say I'm glad I continued being a fan and I'm always amazed at how much she continues to grow.

MiZCudqoFAU,"Since the makers of this video who paid YouTube to get on the trending page won't tell you, I will. Gun stocks rise because people are motivated to buy guns after a mass shooting. Part of what motivates them to do this is the desire to protect themselves from a perceived danger. The other part of this is that people know that politicians will use this even to try and restrict access to guns so it makes people think they'd better buy now before they lose the opportunity. Naturally, when sales go up, the companies do better. When the companies do better, their stock rises because more people see it as a good investment.",0,0

Obviously we should be spending 10 seconds of our life on fake news, instead of a video that you could've made titled Oh shit, Shooting occured, plz help those in need.\\n\\nI'm quite curious as to why your video editor didn't actually make a video, I literally could've made this video in 10 seconds exactly. In fact, these are the types of videos that make regular YouTube viewers think that YouTuber's jobs are easy, because let's be honest here - they think that our 20 minute videos only took 20 minutes to make. Instead, they usually take much longer. \\n\\nEither way, thanks for this beautiful like to dislike ratio. The fact t hat this is trending obviously means that you paid someone, hence your name - CNNMoney. Anyways, thanks for reading, catch you on the flipside, now I'm going back to watch Fox.",1,0

Thankfully, my mother was watching my niece during one of her BBQ s & noticed my niece having trouble sitting up & other balancing problems....My mother had my sister rush in to see her pediatrician but thankfully my nieces dr. was out & had to see another. That pediatrician noticed something that caused her to leave the examination room.....she returned 18 minutes later with a determination in her eyes. She told my sister not to go home, not to stop for any reason but, she was to go immediately to children's hospital in L.A. After 7 hrs in emergency 🚨 she was diagnosed with stage 3 neuroblastoma .

So I would say Jared Kushner is the Antichrist Donald Trump even said if he can't bring peace in the Middle East no one can.  Donald Trump also said in his speech to the UN  Security and Peace Read Kjv 1 Thessalonians 5:3 and he said Beat swords into plowshares. If you're not saved I pray that you find Jesus and ask him to Save you and write you name in the Lambs Book of life if your left behind don't lose hope Read Rev. 14:9-12 also Rev 7:14-17.

Mp_u8KvKg9I,I've heard you mention that quote about just getting a camera and hitting record before.

Thanks for all your work on this show!,9,0
Mp_u8KvKg9I,John: the world didnt know about Wonder Woman after the no mans land incident is because most of the witnesses died. The Germans were all killed in the battle and the Allies who took the village were killed when the poison bomb got dropped leaving almost every witness dead. Luthor found the picture because he was searching for others like Superman (maybe looking someone to fight Superman before settling on Batman). He looked into the stories of this super powered woman from WW2 coming from the few survivors and eventually tracked down that picture. Couldn't use her against superman because she had dissapeared off the grid.,5,0

XCWmONajkOg,"Nothing against the singer or how good the song is. \\n\\nBut personally for me the literal meaning of the song is somewhere along the line: a person couldn't love another as much as they could have considering how much they were loved. And now they hope their (ex) lover finds someone better than them.\\n So instead of pretending that you care and hoping they find someone better, how about you just let them be. Let them hate you instead of trying to appear good to them by being like I hope for the best for you. Even when relationships end under good terms, if someone had truly been in love they don't get over it that easily, so let them hate you cause if you already know you messed up and someone can do better than there's no need to be like that.\\n\\nLike sure maybe you do actually wish the best for them, but if you were in their shoes you wouldn't want to hear anyone say that to you (at least I wouldn't want that) cause who cares what you hope and wish for if you already wasted my time and hurt my feelings. If I loved you then I still love you and it doesn't matter what you 'think' cause it's not going to make me feel better.\\n\\njust my opinion.",0,0

Weinstein was a man who was a gatekeeper of something everybody wanted and nobody had to offer. Stardom. And so he used that power to get what he wanted. It has NOTHING to do with him being a man. It has to do with him having power. The same power that women want and the same power that they use in the same way when they have it.\n\nWomen aren’t some benevolent heavenly gender that are so far above men. Women do the exact same crappy stuff men do the second they have the chance.,0,0

xBU77C4cpTk,"GUYS!!! This is a partnership with MISSGUIDED not Walmart. \\n\\nTo the people complaining about pricing: As Carli mentioned in her video, she isn't in charge of pricing. If you've ever bought anything from Missguided you know they have pretty good quality items, so of course they aren't gonna be budget friendly. Also, Missguided has sales all the time to kind of make up for it, especially if you're a college student. When you first sign up with Missguided it asks you if your'e a college student and make sure to sign up with your college email to get discounts through Unidays. Download the Missguided App, you'll be aware of all the sales going on.\\n\\nTo the people complaining about the outfit design: These were based off of Carli Bybel's own style. She wouldn't design things that she wouldn't wear. A lot of her followers love how she dresses (which is why her first launch sold out so quickly). She mentioned in her video, you could wear most of these items for Holidays/Special Events. Most of the items are not very conservative, most of them are crop top/bandeaus. I've seen many women who are not so slim rock crop tops. If you aren't comfortable wearing the crop tops don't buy them. There are other items that she offers like the skirts, pants, shoes, or jackets. \\n\\nTo people complaining about the sizing: As far as it being only for skinny people, I disagree, The sizing is pretty much 0-12 across the board on most of her items, and only a couple of her items offer bigger sizes. But that's typical for Missguided. It's basically your standard XS, S, M, L, XL. And since there are so many items in this collection (i think she said 100), it's difficult to make so many different sizes of each item. If you look at the single size chart on the Missguided website an XS is a size 4 and an XL would be considered a size 12. \\n\\nIt's not everyone's style, and not on everyone's budget. If you don't like the items or don't like Carli, then don't purchase them plain and simple.",2,0
xBU77C4cpTk,Super happy for you. There were pieces I liked and others not so much but I liked most of them. Very good job Carli. Don't let any of these negatives comments get you down. You're #bookedandbusy and they're #brokeandmad Keep up the good work darlin! ❤️❤️,1,0

Wp2TUPo5W0c,"Thank you so much for the video Dan. I want to share my story with everyone. I recently, out of nowhere, started having seizure symptoms and got rushed to the hospital.The test results show I have potassium difiency which caused hyperventilaltion syndrome (I tends to forget to breath when I'm stressed and hyperventilates to make up for it)) which caused the seizure symptoms. The doctor was confused why me, a 27yo has potassium defiency but I immediately knew it was a result of my self-destruction in the effect of depression, I've been vomitting almost every night and feeling utter crap but my depressed mind just revels in it instead of trying to do something to make myself feel better or seek medical help. I also, because my parents always assumes I'm being dramatic when I feel sick, low-key wanted myself to me terminally ill and die to get revenge on them. After being released I had similar symptoms for several times within two weeks. After a third trip to emergency the doctor told me (very nicely) that these relapses are caused more by my anxiety than anything else. And suggest I go seek professional help.\\nSeizure symptoms are really no fun and laying in emergency overnight staring at my heartrate on a screen becamse a real wake up call to me and the scare was so real and huge that I realized I had been slipping downwards even though I've always thought I have control over my mental health problems. I mean I've been working I'ven been functioning I'm keeping my life normal. But I knew that night in emergency things are wrong beneath the surface and I need to get a grip on things.\\nIt's been exactly 2 weeks since my last trip to emergency and with every minute I realize fighting mental illness is not like a battle that I can go BOOM! POSITIVITY! I'M A RAY OF SUNSHINE FROM NOW ON! Intead it is a fight with an addiction. My own brain's addiction to negativity and sadness. Negative thoughts are an addiction as any addiction. And I am being brave and proud of myself for going cold turkey on negativity and constantly catching my fall and coaxing with kind, patient, gentle words and constantly reminding myself that I am to allow myself to be happy. Just like somebody told me on Koko. Just know that it is your brain being addicted to the sadness and just want to go there, that Sadness is where you feel your safe and comfort zone is. And allow yourself to be happy. It's that hard and it's that easy and I am giving myself a gold star like anyone battling any kind of addiction.\\nLove and strength to everyone too ❤",0,0

Wp2TUPo5W0c,"Plz like this comment I really want dan to see it its really important\\nOmg thank you for this Dan. U have no idea how long I've waited for this kind of video. I've been depressed for years, and no matter what I do, it never seems to help. I find it hard to do normal things, and when i manage to do them, I don't enjoy it. I feel all of the symptoms you talked about. I don't think I've been actually, genuenly happy for years. I've been bullied through out my entirety of secondary school, people telling me I'm worthless, that no one likes me, that I'm better off dead. And with my parents arguing at the time, and getting a divorce just before my GCSEs, it made matters even worse. There have been multiple occasions where I've stared at the rack in the kitchen which holds all our sharp knives, and go to pick one up, only to be stopped by someone walking in. I self harm, I cry myself to sleep every night. I have, on one occasion, tried to overdose on my mums medicine. Back to my point, I want to thank you, Dan, for helping me realize that its ok to talk about my problems and not turn to death every time. Thank you for helping me realize that there is hope out there. That I can do something about it. Thank you Dan.",1,0
Wp2TUPo5W0c,"i love videos like this,but when i say i'm depressed to my family, they just say i'm too young and i'm seeking for attention. No one cares about young people with depression, this video helps me, and probably everyone else who watched this video,thank you dan(iel)",0,0

You might as well have Kelkyanne Conway.  I do not understand how Megan can hold that position in the face of what Trump has said about her father.  WTF???

The energy of the photons is equal to the rest mass of the particles, due to the famous E = mc².\\n\\nRadioactive glucose emits positrons, anti-beta decay, and it's used in PET scans. When the positrons emitted collide with electrons in the brain, the photons can be detected. This shows where the brain is most active (uses the most energy) and can also be used to find cancerous tumours in the brain.\\n\\nCERN managed to make an antihydrogen, an antiproton orbiting a positron, but of course it was annihilated very quickly, 7 seconds I think.\\n\\n_A level physics is fun ^^.

You seem to be handling the idea of it well though. You know the episodes will happen and you'll get the 'numb' feeling but you seem very conscious of the fact that it'll pass and you'll be able to move forward again eventually, which I've always found important. If you can't see a future you, you feel lost but if you can see past the feeling (or lack there of) you know it's just a matter of Yeah, this sucks but maybe I'll be fine by tomorrow. Being able to continue planning your future, knowing you'll still have this happen now and then, in my mind, shows a strong person. I know you didn't make this video for pity and I totally get that but just know that we're here to cheer you up with stupid memes, sarcasm, and all the irony you need.",0,0

Wp2TUPo5W0c,"Hey. I also have depression and this video made me cry, thank you for making it! Because I’m a generally happy person, people often don’t believe me because it is all in my head. You understand what depression feels like completely and I feel as if people who don’t have depression can’t even begin to describe it. I wouldn’t wish mental illness on anyone and I’ll make sure to *try* to do some kinda excercise 😒 (other than P.E which will literally be the death of me). I also have issues with sleep because of depression and knowing that others understand is helpful. Thank you!!!",0,0

I’ve been hella depressed for pretty much my entire life and I always had a hunch you had depression. Maybe it was the constant self deprecating jokes or the comments of wanting death 🤔 but in all seriousness it’s hard to talk about mental illness even if it is much more accepted than it was ten years ago. For you to announce this to the world is brave and everyone here is proud of you.",0,0
Wp2TUPo5W0c,"Last year i fell into a depressed state that lasted about a year. I'm not sure if I can call it depression because it only lasted a year but I often felt like there was this gaping hole in my chest that despite being empty, was so heavy and I felt like I could not do anything. It wasn't the same as being sad but when I had that feeling I knew that I was pretty much a gone cause for the rest of the day. I cried literally everyday, to the point that I actually started counting the number of times I cried, as like some sort of weird coping mechanism. Most people around me didn't realise how depressed I was. In fact, one of my friends said she was jealous of how happy I was all the time. But with the support of my closest friends and family and God, I started getting better till one day, I looked at what I called my cry count, the note where I recorded all the times I cried, and said no more and deleted it. I have gotten better since. Now I occasionally relapse but its not so bad. It helps to have people to support you through your difficulties so don't keep it all to yourself!\\n.\\n.\\nP.S. Dan, I absolutely love your curly hair",0,0

Wp2TUPo5W0c,one thing i’ve noticed is that after this video a lot of people i follow on social media who have some sort of mental struggles found the courage to go and ask for help. many of them have decided to make an appointment with the therapist and some of them even got the needed medication prescribed. there are also people who HAD gone through the therapy in the past but stopped it for some reason and now are restarting again. all because of one important video by one amazing person. and it makes me so happy and proud. thank you dan for making such a great influence <3,0,0

I went to the doctors for eczema and he told me I was depressed and scratching is how I coped and now my skin is all messed up and I hid it for the last 5 years from my friends or anyone who didn’t know previously. Now I realise all the things that made me depressed didn’t actually come into mind or “effect” me emotionally. I did just scratch and still do it as relief. Even though I have millions of scars all over my body, things can be so much worse. Stand strong. 💜💛",0,0

I wish we lived in a world where no one would judge another based on who they were, but unfortunately we don't. Dan, you sending your message of struggle and recovering out to the whole world gives me hope- not that the world will become a better place, but one that is more receptive to the cries and victories of those who feel the same way.

I slept for 4 or so hours this afternoon to avoid my thoughts and also because anxiety and depression are so mentally draining sometimes that I can’t not sleep. I’m in a similar place to what dan described right now, where it only comes back a few times a month usually. But when it does it comes back intensely and suddenly. Those days I don’t usually get out of bed, and often don’t eat or take care of myself. Finishing the day with this made me feel just a little better. Thanks dan.",0,0

Wp2TUPo5W0c,I have bad depression. I can’t function sometimes. Things just feel pointless but I am also suicidal. Have been since 5th grade. I got a B and almost drowned myself in the school toilet. It was bad and I had nothing. \n\nThings just got worse and I thought it was normal and just life was nothing. It got worse and in eighth grade it got so bad I tried to kill myself on 3 different occasions for different reasons. My parents found out after they got into my phone and I got sent to the hospital. I couldn’t be trusted to stay alive and I just lied my way out to my family. Right now I’m 9th grade I don’t go to a therapist and I take the wrong dose of meds but fixing it would mean I would have to admit I have a problem to my family. I started cutting but I am currently 2 weeks clean and I think I may get better but I will be surprised if I make it to 16 much less 18 and right now I have nothing. You have helped me a lot but thing couldn’t get worse to begin with. I know how to tie a noose with my eyes closed and my arms are a mess. My anxiety and depression is bad but it was worse so it’s ok. Not ok but better. I am not about to kill myself so that’s a good sign. Thank you.,0,0
Wp2TUPo5W0c,"I had clinical depression for like five or six years of my life, and I only started feeling good enough to get off of medication last year. You’re right, you do have to force yourself to live a healthy life to start getting better. You have to learn to actually put yourself before others no matter how hard that is. I’m so proud that I’m a happier person now, even if I do still get depressed and anxious from time to time.

SmfWvo4cMpU,"So this is so weird as I watched your videos when you told us your diagnosis but then, about just over a month ago, I was diagnosed out of the blue with cancer myself on my head - intermediate stage melanoma skin cancer on my head. I've just come back from hospital 3 days ago now and am in a lot of pain and barely able to do anything myself. I had to have a skin graft on my head as well as a Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy where they removed 5 lymph nodes from my neck to see it the cancer has spread to them or not. I have to wait 3 weeks till I find out the results for this, it's so scary. I'm also going to be left with a permanent bald patch on my head where they had to remove the melanoma, so my hair will never grow back there. It's so upsetting, but I just wanted you to know that you're not alone. I never in a million years thought at such a young age I would be diagnosed with cancer. I lead a very healthy lifestyle and could never have predicted this, and I'm only 26. Anyway, just sending you hugs, and its so nice to see your improvement over the months <3",1,0

oKzFGhlFqqE,"Frankly, HIllary Clinton should shut about about this, because she has no leg to stand on.  She isn't responsible for the acts of the slimy, sexual predator who is her husband, but she is responsible for enabling him and trash-talking the women he used.  I don't want to hear her blather about sexual predators like I don't want to hear Melania Trump blather about bullying -- they both have a house to clean before preaching to others.\\n\\nFurthermore, this is a great chance to impress on the Democrats once again how much crap Big Money is in politics -- it gets you slimed by association when a big donor is shown to be an equally big arsehole. Get that money out of politics, and at least you only have to deal with the jackasses who're elected officials in your party.",0,0

TWO FACED he/she OBAMA said DONALD IS SEXIST AND MADE HIM OUT TO BE SLIMY BECAUSE HE MADE A COMMENT ABOUT GRABBING PU$$Y which is LIGHT for what we guys usually have to say about it. So where am I going with this well he /she obama had rappers around her and her gay husband constantly. Gay hussein said over and over he had j-z on speed dial. HELLO!!!! j-z only talks about pu$$y and hoes and all that crap. But when a political opponent says something nowhere near what the people this two faced he/she hangs around then suddenly that he/she is indignant, WHAT A FKING JOKE!  This liberal show is trying to equate a man who has had every girl who said something derogatory proved a LIAR and most have admireing stories about there meeting Donald. My point is you twist the fact liberal shows cannot report on YOUR man being a fking PREDATOR you gotta try to slough it off by putting our hero president you keep bashing beside him. TV IS FOR DUMMIES. Its for people who got a light grasp on reality.  The reason this talk show host can act like he does not KNOW that ALL guys talk about pu$$y is because look at him he's a pole smoker 100% Because if he wasn't QUEER I'd have to call him a liar.",0,0

I mean its not entirely my fault right? I know how much it fucking sucks, and it helps me feel less alone in being so... disordered?? when people share so thanks..

Wp2TUPo5W0c,"I actually don't know whether it not i am going through depression. But I would understand if i am. MyMom and dad got divorced just before my first birthday and i only get to see me dad on week every year, and he hasn't visited during the past three, not to mention that growing up literally the entire school (except my small group of like 5 friends) dispised me for no reason in particular my entire childhood. When i tried to talk about it with family everyone claimed it as me being dramatic and that it was all in my head, and now i am scared to talk to my family about it until i am sure i know what is goi g on. I have also been classified as a jinx so my life is just a long trail of bad luck. Recently my mind has been telling me horrible things about myself like you'd be more valuable to everyone if you were dead or no one really likes you, its all pity, you could die tomorrow and everyone would celebrate. I have also developed issues with my family, they are always picking on me and making me feel small, constantly reminding me if my past mistakes. I have tried self-harm, i am too weak to cut, but suffocation with a pillow is easy enough. Sorry if this is really long and overdramatized, I understand if most people dont want to hear this stuff from a person they never met. Again i am sorry",0,0

Wp2TUPo5W0c,aaa thank u for making this lil video dan !!! ive been struggling myself for years now n ive kept it all bottled up inside except for once earlier this year when i told my parents. they told me they would find me anyone i needed to help me but of course i told them i was fine. its months later n im going through some bad feelings again n i think i really need to just say screw it n ask for help. hiding it n trying to figure things out on ur own is exhausting. its help me back from so much too n im so tired of it !!! u sharing this n saying that its okay to talk about makes me feel not so ashamed of my thoughts n feelings. anyway have a good one i love u a lot !!!!!!!!! i hope i can gather the confidence to talk to someone finally,0,0
Wp2TUPo5W0c,One of the biggest most profound things I got from this... I am not my disorder and I don't need to define who I am by my shortcomings.\nYou're a beautiful person Dan and even if it takes you a long time to get a video out we all understand and care about you as a person. You're not just an entertainer to us,0,0
Wp2TUPo5W0c,Thankyou so much for sharing this Dan. I have been slowly struggling with depression since I was about 9 or 10. Im getting better thanks to a very good friend I met because of you and Phil. I hope you keep getting better,0,0
Wp2TUPo5W0c,"Dan... i gravitated towards you in the first place because you seemed like you had gone through depression (even though you never said it outright) and I can't tell you how much this video means to me. After 4 years, 6 therapists, 12 medications, and no improvemnet, it's so easy to just give up, but you are one of the reasons I'm still holding on. Thanks for being real and honest and willing to share. You are truly the best.\\nAlso that tiny clip of you at TATINOF is heartbreaking in context. I wish I could send you a hug.",0,0

Wp2TUPo5W0c,"I really appreciated that you, Dan, included the fact that feeling depressed is different than clinical depression. This age of self-diagnoses misequates feeling down and sad for a short period of time as clinical diagnosis and that can become an issue. Clinical depression requires medical and/or psychological attention and I really appreciate you speaking about your experience. Thats not to say feeling down or depressed temporarily is not significant. But each situation calls for a different response!!",0,0
Wp2TUPo5W0c,"so glad you feel better.. i dont have depression, but i do have other shit, and hearing about the process (ESPECIALLY exercise ughhh i know i have to do it) has been so, SO good to hear.  Very proud of you!! hope the future contains smooth sailing!!!!",0,0

Wp2TUPo5W0c,"I feel a lot better that a person I feel so close with suffers with something I've dealt with in 5th grade. I still do have depressing episodes sometimes but rarely but I've also got major anxiety. I was on medication (zolof) on 25mg. People just say that its just hormones, but they don't believe me when i say I'm feeling depressed. It sucks but its something a lot of people understand and have.",0,0
Wp2TUPo5W0c,Depression is so difficult my dudes and I would not wish it upon anyone.,0,0
Wp2TUPo5W0c,"My depression symptoms are extremely similar (including the loss of appetite). But even if they weren’t, I would so appreciate you using this huge platform you’ve built to bring attention to this. And I greatly appreciate your comments that you are what you are *in spite of* your depression, not because of it, which is so so so true. It’s so easy to look at the black cloud of my depression and wonder what I could be doing if it wasn’t working with other mental health problems to hold me down, and it’s easy to be angry. And sometimes, you just have to be angry I think. So thanks again, Dan. It means so much",0,0
Wp2TUPo5W0c,maybe im just really stoned but this video was actually damn good love you danny you obviously put a lot of work into this and its great.,0,0
Wp2TUPo5W0c,Awww Dan your story is so amazing and I'm so glad that u shared that I was just wondering if u have ever struggled with extreme anxiety like I do it would be great if u were to share anything u know or have experienced about it if u have or not,0,0

Wp2TUPo5W0c,"I had to talk to my doctor so he could prescribe me with depression and I could get 6 free sessions at the psychiatrist and he judged me... the doctor, the one that’s suppose to help me judged me when I told him some of the things I did, I already hated talking about it cause I thought people would judge me but The doctor judged me and so did the psychiatrist so now I hate talking about it even more",0,0
Wp2TUPo5W0c,"As someone who has been Depressed for years since I was little. And well I'm very quite, having a high level of anxiety, depresstion, and stress. So saying anything is hard for me, and I get either very angry or very sad. When I'm angry I'm mad at myself and well I don't know why.  Well I do now, but back then I'd yell at myself and was close to death many times when being both sad and mad during my depresstion. When I'm sad I question why I'm alive and when I should even be breathing. It was hard to be happy and I'm stuck crying for hours. I feel like I'm not good enough as a person, why I even do anything anymore, or not eat for days then binge eat. I literary once sat in the shower (I was really sad) and thought to let the water fill up and drown myself. \\n\\nAnd things not helping me during this time was my schools very stric rules, my dusfunical family, and my bad thoughts from years of bullying. And well I went to three different places till I got a therapist and my pills made me sick at first. Then I got better and everything is getting better and life is brighter. So as Dan said see a professional, get help, and everything will be okay",0,0
Wp2TUPo5W0c,i’ve suffered from depression and self harm but pretty much my whole family pretends it isn’t real and this is very validating and important so thank you,0,0

Wp2TUPo5W0c,Yess thank you Dan for talking about this. I've been struggling with OCD and depression and this made me feel better.,0,0
Wp2TUPo5W0c,"Thank you for sharing, Dan. I agree about the feeling of the 'black hole'- except for me, it feels more like a black storm cloud in my mind, made of irrational thoughts like the ones you described. Sleeping too much or too little is also big in my life, as well as the lack of appetite (it kinda feels like I'm either not allowed to eat, or I do it to keep myself busy). If I may add another tip here, though, cleaning is a good physical activity that will help both in self-care and productivity. Just getting up to make your bed is a good start. When I clean the carpet of the kitchen or do the dishes, it makes me feel like I actually have purpose and influence in my surroundings- it makes me feel like I have control. Again, thank you for sharing this, and I wish you all the best in the future.",0,0
Wp2TUPo5W0c,This is exactly what I needed right now. I have been crying every single day for a whole month now and there's no real reason to this. I am in that black hole constantly and it's only gotten worse over time. And it makes me feel so out of place because everyone around me seems fine but I'm not. It just sucks. It feels like life is just passing me by and I'm a ghost. It takes up all my energy and I have no motivation to do anything anymore. I have considered going to a professional but I've always been sacred to open up because I don't want to be labelled as 'mentally ill' and let that become my identity. But this video has helped me become more aware. It's nice knowing that I'm not alone. Thank you for posting this Dan. You're amazing ❤️,0,0

Wp2TUPo5W0c,I have both serious anxiety and mild depression. I tried talking to my grandmother ((who I live with)) about wanting to see a therapist and she said I was being over dramatic.

I sent it to my friends and for the first time I was actually able to talk about my issues. So thank you 💙💙💙,0,0

Now I still have depression because it's in my DNA but I have learned to live with it with the help of my therapist.  The mixture of drugs and the therapist (who is awesome by the way) helped a lot.  It still hurts to look back but I have to learn to deal with my past and except that.  I am determined to get better, to be happy.",0,0

Wp2TUPo5W0c,"Hey, Dan! So I've been feeling like this for a while now, I'd say maybe 2-3 years, and some of my closest friends know about how I feel, but I don't know how to tell my parents. In fact, last time I went to the doctor, they asked me questions in order to determine if I suffered from depression, AND I LIED. I already figured I did, and my mom was sitting right there in the room staring at me with her judging why-aren't-you-perfect-like-me eyes so I just casually answered no to every question even though some of the answers were most certainly yes. Whoop dee doo. Thanks, peer pressure! Normally I relieve my stress through running & basketball, but seeing as I've had a broken shin for the past 2 months, that's not really an option right now. I'm just not sure what to do and am hoping that since I just poured my heart out in one comment that's probably about to reach the max level of characters, you'll have some kind of advice for me...?? Thanks for always making me laugh & helping pull me out of my hole on days like these. :)",0,0
Wp2TUPo5W0c,"I want to get help about my mental help but my parents don't believe that I have mental health problems. I've tried telling them but they just brush it off as me overreacting or as me self diagnosing myself.

qRoVlH1OcI4,"I see nothing wrong with protesting.....unless you have a dumb reason for it, and the NFL players did. Kaepernick, one of the key ones, refused to stand up for the flag because it represents a country that oppresses black people and people of color. This is 2017, not 1968. Black people are not oppressed. If anything, straight white males are. These athletes are filthy rich assholes who make a shit load of money by tackling people and playing ball. They do so in AMERICA. This country pays them $1.5million to be in ads and play ball. No one else makes that kind of money-not even the highest paid surgeon(Invasive Cardiologist) makes that much, and these people save lives-not appear on TV for the entertainment of sports enthusiasts. If these NFL players break a law, they merely have to bribe an official and they can get off scot free. They of all people have no right to protest, so they absolutely should stand during the anthem, and should most certainly be suspended if they don't. Trump is right to say that they are disrespecting our country, and Hillary, once again, is wrong. If anyone has the right to protest the flag, its white families who cannot earn money due to chronic disabilities and are denied welfare because some lazy ass mom with a bunch of kids she can't afford or an illegal Mexican family needs it more. There people have every right to protest, not some filthy rich football player. Many of you are hating on trump because you don't like him. He isn't perfect, but he's human. Does he say some stupid shit? Yes, he does. But given the choice, would you rather have someone who runs their mouth but does their job right, or someone who can make a decent speech while enjoying the suffering they're causing you? Take your pick.",3,4

Wp2TUPo5W0c,I have ptsd and depression and  anxiety so I know what your going thought,0,0
Wp2TUPo5W0c,"Thank you for sharing this. I'm 31 and have had serious depressive episodes since I was 9. Mine seems strongly biological (I also have a bipolar uncle!). I've been on antidepressants since I was 15, and I'll probably be on them for my entire life. I'm okay with that, though. I've had to take allergy medicines since I was too young to swallow pills, so a life with medicine is normal to me. I've also seen therapists, but they did squat for me when I wasn't on medicine. Everybody's experience is different, though. I also tend to have the kind of depression where I feel sad and cry a lot, and get clingy. Most people seem to feel nothing and withdraw, but I feel actively terrible during my episodes.",0,0
Wp2TUPo5W0c,"How does anyone start therapy or how do you know that something is wrong? Because sometimes I feel like that, so bad and dark and in the cloud of misery but then whenever it eventually ends I feel like I'm overreacting and that wasn't as bad as I thought it was. And sometimes I think I need a therapist or something but I don't think I could ever bring it up to my parents because I think they would be like what do you mean you're fine or they'd take me and it'd turn out I was actually overreacting",0,0

Wp2TUPo5W0c,Thank you Dan. This has really helped me realize or further realize how I can assist my friends and boyfriend with their mental illnesses.

I would wander out of the house in my early teens and memorize roads, and the walking hurt but I got better and better at it. during those walks, I would just kind of meditate, and it was a lot like painstakingly climbing out of the hole you described. it wasn't a cure, but it helped ground me. it's hard, living day to day, and sometimes I slip up, but it's important to remember that, Idk. you're not a bruised supermarket apple, and again, it can get better. this was sweet",0,0

Wp2TUPo5W0c,It often starts during childhood or adolescent days because of what we call identity role(though not all people have the same reasons as this like Dan having clinical depression). Best way to overcome is really just to seek someone who you can trust fully and devote yourself. It is where you can learn to have self-esteem(well some ppl don't) but having someone you can hold on to will slowly help you get better as you grow.,0,0

I was depressed for 8 years some days were better than others during that time period in my life but I was never fully happy I felt so horrible, hopeless, and useless. So I can definitely sympathize with what you're going through and even though I consider myself to be better than what I was I can bounce back into depression fairly easily but I've finally found a group of people that are supportive and I've never had anyone like that in my life before. Unfortunately, I never tried to get help... but honestly I should have. Sometimes I wonder how different things would've turned out for me or if maybe I would've been able to get to this point in my life sooner but I guess I'll just never know if that's the case. I really do hope that things continue going well for you. Never give up cause you never truly fail until you quit trying,",0,0

Wp2TUPo5W0c,I have had depression ever since 6th grade and I am in high school now. I take strong antidepressants and I also had a therapist ever since 6th grade and it was honestly a very tiring and interesting journey to find out who I really was as a teenager. I found out my true identity in 8th grade and I am still trying to find out the rest of me nowadays. I am a teenager that loves physiology and enjoys seeking the concept of life XD,1,0

I feel like Louis is really struggling and I suspect he has been for a very long time...\\nHonestly, despite how much I hate management for the shit they put Louis through and the insecurities they gave him about being the useless one in the band, it's worked out in his favour because they've mostly left him alone to make his own solo music, with all the production power focussed on Harry and Niall. It means his solo stuff has a much more genuine, honest and raw feel to them than any of the others'.",0,0

HYWiIWpcCIM,"I have 'f*ck fate' tattooed on me, so that should tell you how I feel about determinism.",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,This person doesn't know what they are talking about determinism is the belief that everything follows scientific laws and therefore even though we have a consciousness we are already on a set path which cannot change. It isn't a debate we have only one fate and we don't have a choice about it. This video isn't trying to be correct but to be a motivational piece on how you should try to be a better person.,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,It’s all about choices and your reaction to whatever is happening.,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,Free will is an oxymoron. Fate guides your hand.,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,We have free will within certain physical boundaries,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,Actually we aren't free to choose our attitudes if there is no free will.,0,0

HYWiIWpcCIM,"Lol, this is some funny stuff. There is more going on at the same time in this world then we have a number for  , like we can't count that high. So if I walk outside and step on an Ant, then that was predetermined that I was going to step on that Ant long before I went outside? Sorry,  but a million choices go through my head and everyone else's head and out that Choice or choices from those millions of thoughts and ideas , I really had no choice to begin with? Sorry  ,but we all have free will and if it was not for free will then the expression of ideas and thoughts world be completely different.  Go ahead and pick a color out of the coloring box or not, it's your choice.",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,The monetary system limits our freedom of free will.,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,That dog analogy is the equivalent of story mode in a video game. You can control the player but the game has a set story and ending regardless of who plays it. Its the Illusion of choice.,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,You have will. But it certainly isnt free.,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,220 people only watched 1 second of the video!,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,this is so good! I absolutely agree.,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,Did you just try to solve a physical scientific question with a platitude?,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,I have free will in the sense that I do what I choose to do based on who I am.\nI have no free will in the sense that who I am was determined by external factors.,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,Why couldn't you upload this earlier when we actually had this for a test?,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"You know what. Eventhough most people make sense when they say that we have no freewill according to most sound justifications like we are part of the universe etc. I believe them and it made me more miserable bcos the reason my mind wanders all the time is that I don't like my condition; enough to wish that I am not part of this universe, I mean I didn't signed up for this, my parents made me and the laws of nature cooked me to this form and consciousness. So in a way I appreciate the hard labor of the universe but since I don't want to exist I thought about suicide, researched it. I found out that it is a way out. Just like that and you won't be part of humanity's existence. BUT since I am made up of common elements it doesn't mean that the universe cannot cook me in another place or condition so I figured if the universe wanted me and others similar like me in our way of thinking so bad to exist maybe the universe is bored. If I kill myself then it's freewill there. I won't be existing to amuse the universe anymore. If I don't then it's also freewill. So what am I gonna do? Only me knows ☝",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"My fate was seen in my eyeball using witchcraft when i was a child. I expressed it using poetry as a schoolkid  but didnt realise what i was describing until recently. \\nIt was hellfire. And an exact event occured 2 years ago that was foreseen and i was warned of as a child. I was warned to beware of a bearded fat man which turned out to be me.\\nim not fat , i received the holy spirit unbaptised and was quickly cut off. \\nwhich filled me with evil spirits.\\nSo even with Gods intervention  with the holy spirit, fate played out EXACTLY as seen in my eyeball using witchcraft in my childhood.\\nthere mustve been a million choices made in that time by me and those affecting my life but it still worked out exactly. \\nWhich makes me side with dog on a leash theory in the video.\\nGod  allows us to believe we are the authors of our own salvation, perhaps for our own happiness. But its  only when you're damned that you realise  that there was no escaping your destiny. \\nAnd bear in mind im aware of time travel, but i was damned by the witch who saw hell in  my eyeball. And he is also aware of it.",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"I don't think you can beat determinism by just believing you can. Determinism has already decided in your conclusion to the question, even if it is to believe you have free will. This is some odd pop philosophy",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,But if you think everything is predetermined someone strip themselves of liability and accountability and may therefore perform horrible acts as they felt it is predetermined by not binding themselves to any moral obligations.\n\nAt the flip side it can empower someone to do great things cause they feel it is their mission in life.\n\nIn my opinion it pushes people to their extremes as they are less likely think of consequences since consequences are just part of the predetermined future.,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,two psychological qualities defeatism and aspiration that you end up is also coz of no free will.,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"based on the first 3 minutes, i really worry that this video is promoting the idea that its up to you to decide whether free will exists. umm.. it either exists or it doesn't. sorry to say but the ontology of the universe doesn't care about you.",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,i cant chose between 'free will' or 'determinism'. even if i knew wich one would make me happier. i dont chose to believe something. i look at the facts and decide which one seems more plausible.chosing one over the other because of preference can only be done by ignoring facts,0,0

HYWiIWpcCIM,"For sure we don't have total free will, because otherwise we would already be the overmen described by Nietzsche. I mean we probably have quite some power to will though. Then the universe can't be fully determined because at the quantum level everything is only defined in terms of density of probability. I think we are asked to choose between two extremes and most likely the truth is just somewhere in-between.\\n\\nAnd actually there's a misconception people have about quantum physics, we don't live in a random world, we live in a probabilistic world. Randomness is not predictable at all, whereas here, although we cannot predict the outcome at a quantum level, we can predict the probability of outcomes.",0,0

HYWiIWpcCIM,"Since the fundamental aspect of reality is the will of course we are free as things-in-themselves.  The individual is the thing-in-itself, not the ego, not the self, but the will.  What we will is determinant on character.  Change the character change the will.  Thus, Paul could say, 'it is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me.'  If you see the reality of the world and then make a dicision that is a free choice.   Kierkegaard called this the leap of faith.  Reason is limited to the phenomenal presentation, the will is not.",0,0

HYWiIWpcCIM,"Let's look at this as a thought experiment (but, fyi, there is no right or wrong answer).\\n\\nYou enter a white room from door number one with another door on the other end of the room.\\n\\nStraight ahead of you, and in between the two doors are two buttons.\\n\\nNeither button has any marks or distinguishing features.  They seem to be complete copies.\\n\\nWhich button do you press? Left or right? 1 or 2?\\n\\nOnce you press the button, a sign lights up politelty asking you to leave through door number 2 on the other end of the room.\\n\\nThis door transports you back through door number one and wipes your memory of the previous experience percisely.  You have no memory or the slightest feeling of deja vu when enering the room again.  Everything, down to the last atom, is exactly the same from your perspective.\\n\\nAgain, there are two buttons in front of you and a door on the other side of the room.\\n\\nWhat do you do?\\n\\nDo you choose the same action as before (since you have no prior knowlege of your previous action) or do you do something completely different?",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"A proper School of Life video, like back in the day? Wow!",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"I follow both determinism and aspiration, while I see technical correctness in determinism I also agree that the emotions and workings of the human brain tend to misunderstand what it really means; it doesn't mean fate or an inability to change for example, just that these outcomes follow from the past and whatever state of wiring your brain currently is in and that the very knowledge of determinism is an event that can affect what you are 'determined' to do.",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"This is an utterly pish it's whatever you believe it is answer. Yes, the determinism argument doesn't need to be in absolutes- but you're practising the opposite of philosophy by telling people to make up their own minds based on relevancy to a question like this. Dissapointed.",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"I believe in a soft fatalism.  We have free choice, but that is really only granted to defy our a divinely appointed destiny lest we chide against the Almighty as one does a dictator.   You can step back from your calling.  You can bite the beckoning finger and chart a course foreign and unprotected.  Freedom can sometimes be as spiteful exercise.  I believe those who suffer most in life are the most free.  Those who feel the most ease have allowed natural designs and propensities to lead the dance.  For such a person there are only moments of agony as one figures out his own yearning and ability.  That momentary pain of disconnect is remedied as soon as body and mind syncs up to bow itself to a fate that sits at an arms reach of scepter and crown. A fate that can not clutch these ornaments of power will clutch a whip or a rode.  Men would much prefer to die a fated death in their youth, than to die at an old age covering their feet.",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"Determinism does not mean that you should give up because the future is already planned. It means that what you do was always what you were going to do. It is not that was going to happen to me whether I do __ or not. The option is not there and was never there. You always were going to do or not do __ . Just in case this is not true, act as if you do have free will and strive for the best.  There is really no downside.",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,To have free will means that you have the option to do good or to do bad. Free will have never ment that we can do what ever we dream about.,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,Your conciousness is free . Where focus goes energy flows. Control your energy control your destiny,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"So everyone is just going to ignore an entire discipline within philosophy which has given us so much - phenomenology. Free will is an unconditional given beginning from experience. When you posit a deterministic worldview you are doing metaphysics, which cannot hold its own weight if we begin from pure conscious experience alone. The world still has not realized that metaphysics has failed us, and phenomenology is the new and final first philosophy.",1,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,I like the sound effects,1,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,Everyone down here in the comment section is starting debates but I'm just like who cares. This video was saying that you shouldn't care about what others believe but focus on how this question relates to your life. Loved the video,1,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"The main argument for predeterminism is physical. Politics and social environments may undirectly and partly determine our actions, but they are physically determined just as well. It's not just that it could hardly be another way: everything simply cannot be, and never could have been any different.\\nThis theory seems to be widely accepted now, and it's also been supported by the latest research in neuroscience.\\nNevertheless, the conclusion of the video remains a nicely balanced way of dealing with the idea of a completely determined world as well as with the (so damn convincing) illusion of free will that keeps us going.",1,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"Not sure about this one Alain... interesting idea nonetheless! But the thought that whether we *do* have free will or not surely is worth considering? Not just whether it is more beneficial to believe so. Seems like a dangerous idea that the truth of how the world actually is should be disregarded, in favour of just believing whatever makes our lives better. Thought experiment: if I am happier and lead a more fulfilling life if I believe that the earth is flat, should I avoid pursuing the truth and believe it?",1,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,I recently finished 1984 and was about to procrastinate.\n\nSomeone's definitely stalking me.,0,1
HYWiIWpcCIM,"There simply isn't a debate over this.  All evidence proves that there isn't free will.  Everything is environmental, and we are part of that external environment.  There is no nature vs nurture, only nature.\\n\\nMaking choices doesn't mean you have free will, nor using your brain to select actions means you have free will.  Your brain structure is genetic and all the things inside come from the environment.  Neither of these you can control.  Ultimately, the concept of free will is an delusion used by human beings to give artificial hope or a psychological boost.",0,1

HYWiIWpcCIM,Doesn't this boil down to where we believe our locus of control is?,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"It can't be both. You can lie to yourself and act like there is sweet spot between the two like this video describes but that won't change the fact that everything was predetermined directly after the big bang. We are the result of particles bumping together, making stars, expoding supernovas, and under the right conditions, complex life and millions of years of evolution. We think we make our own choices but our brains would make the same choice every time if the initial conditions are the same.",0,0

HYWiIWpcCIM,"This video is more about what feels nice to us as humans and less about objective truth.

It’s just a thought, but it’s a reoccurring thought of mine that I want to share. Do you guys get these thought too?",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,Our life is predetermined:\n1. We are ALL going to die one day from something.\n2. We are ALL going to forget everything we ever knew and experienced.\n3. We are ALL going to be forgotten one day in future eternity as if we never ever existed at all in the first place.\n(OSICA).,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"Nihilism is the answer. Absolute Nothiing is nonsense because its unquantafiable, undefineable, unmeasureable etc. . Determinism = Infinity cause theres always more reasons, logic, scientific study. So infinity is nonsense because its unquantafiable , undefineable , unmeasureable etc. . Reality is one or the other infinite or nothing . Ie. Existence is entirely subjective anythings possible.",1,1
HYWiIWpcCIM,"We have free will to the extent that our pre-programmed brains allow us, but what we do is inevitable because of the environment around us and our preset biological preferences for action.

HYWiIWpcCIM,No need to watch the video. The answer is: both. 100% free will and 100% predestination. The seeming paradox is only one caused by limited language and limited human perception and reasoning. They are not mutually exclusive.,1,4
HYWiIWpcCIM,"I love SOL, but I disliked this video. It's as if philosophy is only up for the individual to pick and choose what suits the individual. We should also reflect on things in terms of how they impact the collective. Regarding this topic, the idea of no free will is a potentially dangerous proposition for society, in my view. How could we ever judge or incriminate someone if no one is responsible for their actions?",0,3
HYWiIWpcCIM,"We  definitely have free will (we can choose), but  we are also pre-determined..... to be the best we can be... in our own unique ways - which we can know somehow. (introspection and work)...",0,3
HYWiIWpcCIM,"Wrong terms, I judge. Free will is not the opposite of predetermination. Self-determination is. Thus, the terms should be: Self-determination vs. Predetermination. And, since there is NO magic, there is NO predetermination. This is due to the fact that predetermination requires some form of magic pre  (e.g. - God, gods, fate, horoscope, luck, etc.), thus without magic no action or outcome can be predetermined. This is my reasoned judgement based on my prior reasoned judgement that there is NO magic. Free will, according to Kant, is the ability to do what you DON'T want to do solely because your reason has led you to a judgement that to do so is the RIGHT thing to do. Key points: 1) There is NO magic. 2) Read and understand Kant, he's brilliant.",0,3

No matter how much CBT one employs, if their hormones are too far out of balance, then they cannot choose their attitude. Also, there is a bigger concept that needs to be understood: even the choice to change one’s influences is based off previous influences that one did not choose.",0,1

xBU77C4cpTk,"Amazing. Beautiful colors and fabrics. Everything may not be for me, but at least half  of everything is. Also, you get what you pay for with F21. While I love that store, you need to really take care of the clothes you buy there if you want them to last. I feel like these would last a tad bit longer. Much support and good vibes!",0,0

xBU77C4cpTk,"Carli, I'm so disappointed ☹ most of this stuff are items I can find at Forever 21. I was so looking forward to it but I'm not crazy about anything, especially the slouchy looks that I can't get in Downtown LA for $5. Nothing like all the good quality product you had for Spring. I'll probably buy 1 item. All the rest I hated 😭",0,0

xBU77C4cpTk,I want that Velvet dress so bad but I wish it could come in at least 2 more sizes up I'm way more comfortable buying things that are slightly baggy and not completely fitted and plus the size conversions to Australian gets me a bit worried...,0,0
xBU77C4cpTk,"Too expensive. I think the previous collection was better. The majority doesn’t look like fall to me. I like some of the pieces but the only pieces I can afford to buy and can wear are the joggers and the navy leggings which I’m not that crazy about. A lot are two pieces which are cute, but I’ll never wear the top. I know you can buy the top and bottom separately but I would’ve liked the option of a matching jacket or longer top that doesn’t show my stomach. I definitely like the mini pink and green dress from last collection better because I liked the high neck these look plain to me. I think my favorite pieces are the jeans jacket and the shoes but can’t afford to spend almost $100 on 1 item. Pretty sad I probably won’t be getting anything. Sorry Carli, love you!! Not trying to bash on you, just being honest on why I’m not fan of the collection so far. I’m definitely waiting to see the rest of the collection. Again this is just my opinion, everyone else seems to love it otherwise:)",0,0

Since there wasn’t a try on in this video by anyone slimmer. Got a good amount tho.

HYWiIWpcCIM,"As a hard determinist, I believe that even our thoughts and personal decisions are beyond our design. As we cannot control the biological and chemical functions of our brain, the traits given to us by our genetic code, or the external stimuli that influence us, since our consciousness, judgement, perception and decision making ability are directly tied to our brain (precisely our frontal lobe), and as there is no perceivable way to test the concept of free will (since time is unchangeable), the existence of free will, the concept of randomness, and the perception of ‘possibility’ are purely based on faith. Scientifically, every event can hypothetically be predicted through calculation, as all matter exists under the laws of nature and physics.",0,0

HYWiIWpcCIM,"I disagree with the way determinism is described in this video. It's talked about like it says that our lives are determined by the people and activities around us. I believe that determinism is the theory that absolutely everything is determined by the laws of nature. This brings me to two conclusions- One, that, given the exact same set of circumstances twice, the same result will be achieved, even with human thought or decision.\\nTwo, that, given knowledge of all things, present and past, literally EVERYTHING, a being could successfully predict the future with 100% accuracy.\\nSo for me, this video does not even discuss determinism. \\nWith my interpretation of determinism, there is no reason to change one's view or actions about the world, because it will not change anything. You just have to kind of ignore it and move on.",0,0

HYWiIWpcCIM,@The School Of Life ; Thank You so Much for giving Insight on this Issue. I had prevously written to you about this Particular Topic as I sought to find clarity and understanding about this. I am very much grateful for your response.,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"What people don't seem to understand here is that he's not arguing that free will exists. He's arguing that propagating the idea that free will doesn't exist can be harmful. And in making this claim, he's rendering the question of free will's existence to a mere curiosity and not something of significance. Certainly if free will doesn't exist, the illusion of it does. And this illusion is what allows human beings to conceive of the universe they occupy as well as what allows for the existence of morality.\\n\\nSo to people saying things like science should not lie to people about free will, your belief in what should or should not be done relies on your own inherent belief in free will. \\n\\nLong story short, if you're willing to tell people that free will doesn't exist, at least stress the importance of treating it as if it did.",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"Our personality is the continuity of every decision we ever made. So free choice is crucial to identify as the person we are.\\nIf you believe in determinism, you believe that you never made any decisions in your life. There would be no difference, as everything is just the product of causality. \\nI know you can't prove one thing or the other, but i really have to believe in free will, otherwise it would drive me into depressions.",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,Free will doesn't exist and the Bible confirms it. Wannabe Christians who don't read the Bible believe in free will because they're retarded and believe in a horned red man who causes all the evil in the world. Directly contradicting the same God they claim to worship who says he does all good and evil in Isaiah 45:7. Romans in the New Testament declares God predestined people for salvation directly removing any chance of their being free will being predetermined events can't be enforced by any freedom of action even to the very least extent.,0,0

In difference to that, the believe in determinism gives us an impression of having no choice in life. That results, in my opinion, in an negative thinking wich blocks an active and self-fullfilling life. That might sound like a paradoxon, but it think that an active life needs the believe in a free will and self-made choices to accomplish and succes. To sum it up: I believe in determinism from a scientific point of view. From a human point of view, that looks to manage everyday life, wich can`t result on scientific thinking in every moment, i think it´s more succesful to believe in a free will. So, what´s your opinion on that?",0,0

To clarify, is our life predetermined and we only have the illusion of free will (choice) or do the choices we make change and affect future outcome? \\n\\nAs I feel is being discussed in this video this question has then been boiled down and changed in the course of making it more personal instead of general. But it does not answer my question or give insight on whether we actually posses something as free will, or that all is predetermined (by our brain functions/ some kind of god/ simulation theory).\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say the video isn't good or that I know better (I know absolutely nothing and am no philosopher), in fact thumbs up for the time and effort spent in creating this video!",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"We do not have free will. It's an illusion, a lie. I want to be a film director.

Your ability to kiss ass and suck up and sellout and be a sheep gets you further in life than being genuine. If others don't like you they want to see you fail instead of just leaving you alone. Our society is plagued with mental illness and no one wants to admit it. We make excuses.

HYWiIWpcCIM,"This school doesn't understand what free will means. Dogs tied to a cart? No. How about: humans are animals - like dogs, but we're a bit smarter, so we can better predict what consequences our actions might have. Our brains make decisions based on these calculations (just like a dog's brain), but the kicker, and it's been experimentally shown, is that our brain makes decisions BEFORE we are consciously aware of the decision. Therefore while we feel like we have free will because we feel our brains making decisions, we actually have no more free will than dogs or ants, who respond to their environment with the best reactions their DNA and previous experience can muster.

HYWiIWpcCIM,"Free will is not equivalent to indeterminism. If nature followed certain probabilities (which it probably does to some extent), how would we be in control of anything?

HYWiIWpcCIM,"IMO free will exists simultaneously with determinism. What is free will but our choices, and what are our choices but the deliberation over different courses of action before a singular decision is made -- a singular decision which is the specific and necessary result of an individual's biology (including neurology), environment, and history. When we deliberate about a choice we're searching our knowledge of the world to see what the best course of action would be.

Those who still argue this are just in denial about their lack of agency and the inevitable damage that realisation does to ones ego.\\n\\nOur existences were predetermined at the birth of the universe and no amount of stoicism will change that. \\n\\nThe argument over which view to take is far less important at an individual level than when we apply it to our judgements of others. It is the difference between voting to cut benefits for the disabled because we think that they just need to be more determined about finding a job, or not because we accept that life success is not all personal choice.\\n\\nBeing rats directed around a maze by stimuli we can't perceive, only one benefit can be gained by understanding our lack of free will. That is that we use the knowledge to foster more compassionate attitudes to one another and aim wherever possible to create environments that can positively influence those subjected to them.\\n\\nWe don't chose our lives but we have no choice but to go along with the delusion.

They're actually showing the same amount of respect by kneeling of course the ones that sit are kinda of disrespectful but the ones kneeling are very respectful. They aren't acting like it doesn't exist they are prostesting. You guys get mad when blacks protest someone dying by yelling through cities but when they do it peacefully you still get mad?

xBU77C4cpTk,"Too expensive. I think the previous collection was better. The majority doesn’t look like fall to me. I like some of the pieces but the only pieces I can afford to buy and can wear are the joggers and the navy leggings which I’m not that crazy about. A lot are two pieces which are cute, but I’ll never wear the top. I know you can buy the top and bottom separately but I would’ve liked the option of a matching jacket or longer top that doesn’t show my stomach. I definitely like the mini pink and green dress from last collection better because I liked the high neck these look plain to me. I think my favorite pieces are the jeans jacket and the shoes but can’t afford to spend almost $100 on 1 item. Pretty sad I probably won’t be getting anything. Sorry Carli, love you!! Not trying to bash on you, just being honest on why I’m not fan of the collection so far. I’m definitely waiting to see the rest of the collection.

Since there wasn’t a try on in this video by anyone slimmer. Got a good amount tho.

PUlfvXaISvc,"Thank you Statoil and good luck to all involved with the Hywind Scotland floating wind farm project!\\nI have suggestions for integrating wind farms into the electricity grid so as to provide power on demand whatever the weather.\\nWind, storage and back-up system designer http://scottish.scienceontheweb.net/Wind%20power%20storage%20back-up%20calculator.htm?wind=30#wind \\nPeak demand, wind and back-up power / energy usage and storage capacity calculator\\nFor the specification and design of renewable energy electricity generation systems which successfully smooth intermittent wind generation to serve customer demand, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and 52 weeks a year.\\n\\n(Which recommends about 150MWh of energy storage capacity for a 30MW wind farm)\\n\\nScottish Scientist\\nIndependent Scientific Adviser for Scotland\\nhttps://scottishscientist.wordpress.com/",0,3
PUlfvXaISvc,"What a nutty idea, $274M for a wind farm of a lousy 30MW. So $274M/30MW=$9.1K per peak kw or $26k per avg delivered kw , not including the 3X oversized transmission lines and the unavoidable backup/storage high cost. Hinkley Point capital cost is $26B for 3.2 GW @ a 90% CF% = $9k per delivered avg kw of output or  The avg cost of the last 6 Offshore Wind Farms built in Britain was $4.9k per peak kw. And avg 37% CF% = $4.9/.37 = $13.2k per avg delivered kw = $13.2/$9k = 1.5X the cost of Hinkley. That's for FOAK, First-Of-A-Kind nuclear, not like the well established, 1000th of a kind, factory produced, fully mature, Wind Turbines. And I hate the EPR, we should be going full out on factory built, meltdown proof Molten Salt Reactors, that is the future, the EPR is an expensive, over-engineered dinosaur Nuclear Tech. If we are going to continue with these expensive EPRs and AP1000s we might as well just rent power off of Russian or Chinese built offshore nuclear barges at 1/3rd to 1/2 the cost of the EPR or AP1000.  \\n\\nFed up with the French EPR, Finland opted for the Russian VVER-1200 with a guaranteed price of 50 Euros per MWh, 1/3rd the price of Offshore Wind and a six year build time. Far greater rate of electricity growth, for reliable 24/7 electricity close to demand centers than can be done with part time renewables.\\n\\nExcept the Wind turbines supply a low grade intermittent power that lasts for 8-20 yrs vs Hinkley a high grade reliable power that lasts for 60-100yrs. And the Wind doesn't replace any infrastructure, in fact it ADDS infrastructure due to intermittency, and will not replace any of the vast fossil infrastructure, you still need all the power plants, maintained manned and often fired up, building steam, all the vast natural gas pipelines, production wells, fracking sites, storage, oil infrastructure, tankers, military, coal mines, rail cars, LNG tankers, the works. That is a huge investment & maintenance cost. So all solar and wind does is replace a bit of NG fuel worth 2 cents a kwh in the USA.\\n\\nAnd now the EU has finally approved the South Korean APR-1400 for use in Europe. They are building four APR-1400's in UAE, starting from scratch, construction began in July 2012, first reactor to be finished this year, ahead of schedule, all four 5.6 GWe operating in 2020, generating 31X the energy of this incessantly hyped in Big Oil's controlled media, Hornsea 2 offshore wind farm, built by DONG = Danish Oil & Natural Gas company. Except the wind requires fossil shadowing power (~80% fossil), the Nuclear needs no fossil.  And Hornsea 2 @ a cost of $7.9B for avg 670MW or $11.8B/GWavg vs the APR-1400's @ $20B for avg 5.2 GW or $3.9B/GWavg or 32% of the cost. Except the nuclear is reliable 24/7, windy/calm, summer/winter, cold spell/hot spell power for 60-100yrs vs the wind lasting for 8-20yrs. And then there is the Nuscale, Terrapower and ThorCon SMRs which are factory built, deliverable Nuclear modules. So in fact there should be no problem supplying all of EU's electricity demand and additional EV electricity demand with Nuclear power. With the Nuclear having reliable, continuous surplus power at nighttime when the EVs are charging. So Nuclear will be able to supply all electricity demand with maximum grid efficiency and no need of either storage or fossil backup.",2,1

HYWiIWpcCIM,"But in my research, it seems like there is both free will and determinism at the same time.  Reality is random (pure mathematical randomness, as seen in Pascal's triangle) with all possible combinations of matter and energy being covered, somewhere, somewhen, in all possible universes.  This is a determinstic process, with a simple division and recombination of patterns where every division splits reality into two universes, and every recombination bringing some universes back together, like river tributaries flowing down a mountain.  The free will comes in with the fact that it's all a random process, and you can't know what will happen next in one timeline, even if you could know all the possible past timelines combined.  Which we don't.  So life is unpredictable, and the more complex an individual is, the more unpredictable they are.

I can’t add a year or take a year from my life no matter how hard i try, and because the moment of my death is already set in stone because the future exist where i die, that tells us that there’s no control of anything else either.

HYWiIWpcCIM,"Funnily enough, the voice actor sounds an awful lot like the guy who voiced the Meditations audiobook, a book on stoicism.",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,The conclusion has been also explained by Tolstoy. He stated that the frame in which we are able to make choice is insignificant but what really matters is our capacity to walk willingly through fate rather than being dragged by it.,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,Doesn't the ability to choose whether or not we want to lean more towards defeatism or aspiration presuppose the belief in free will?,0,0

HYWiIWpcCIM,@The School Of Life ; Thank You so Much for giving Insight on this Issue. I had prevously written to you about this Particular Topic as I sought to find clarity and understanding about this. I am very much grateful for your response.,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"What people don't seem to understand here is that he's not arguing that free will exists. He's arguing that propagating the idea that free will doesn't exist can be harmful. And in making this claim, he's rendering the question of free will's existence to a mere curiosity and not something of significance. Certainly if free will doesn't exist, the illusion of it does. And this illusion is what allows human beings to conceive of the universe they occupy as well as what allows for the existence of morality.\\n\\nSo to people saying things like science should not lie to people about free will, your belief in what should or should not be done relies on your own inherent belief in free will. \\n\\nLong story short, if you're willing to tell people that free will doesn't exist, at least stress the importance of treating it as if it did.",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"Our personality is the continuity of every decision we ever made. So free choice is crucial to identify as the person we are.\\nIf you believe in determinism, you believe that you never made any decisions in your life. There would be no difference, as everything is just the product of causality. \\nI know you can't prove one thing or the other, but i really have to believe in free will, otherwise it would drive me into depressions.",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,Free will doesn't exist and the Bible confirms it. Wannabe Christians who don't read the Bible believe in free will because they're retarded and believe in a horned red man who causes all the evil in the world. Directly contradicting the same God they claim to worship who says he does all good and evil in Isaiah 45:7. Romans in the New Testament declares God predestined people for salvation directly removing any chance of their being free will being predetermined events can't be enforced by any freedom of action even to the very least extent.,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,Just because we don't have free will doesn't mean we are predetermined.,0,0

HYWiIWpcCIM,"Man can do what he wills, but he cannot will what he wills. - Schopenhauer",2,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"I am confused here; is free will interpreted as claiming to have the power to control your life/future events? Or is the question more geared towards choice versus predetermination? To clarify, is our life predetermined and we only have the illusion of free will (choice) or do the choices we make change and affect future outcome? \\n\\nAs I feel is being discussed in this video this question has then been boiled down and changed in the course of making it more personal instead of general. But it does not answer my question or give insight on whether we actually posses something as free will, or that all is predetermined (by our brain functions/ some kind of god/ simulation theory).\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say the video isn't good or that I know better (I know absolutely nothing and am no philosopher), in fact thumbs up for the time and effort spent in creating this video!",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"We do not have free will. It's an illusion, a lie. I want to be a film director. Went to school got a degree and guess what it doesn't matter how good you are or how hard you work or how educated you are. Others determine what you can do in life. Not YOURSELF. Your ability to kiss ass and suck up and sellout and be a sheep gets you further in life than being genuine. If others don't like you they want to see you fail instead of just leaving you alone. Our society is plagued with mental illness and no one wants to admit it. We make excuses. Do we have the courage to break free from this cookie cutter corporate run world or are we just meat for the grinder. You live you work you get to have fun once in a blue moon then you die. We are just cattle for the super rich. Always have been.",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"Nothing is predestined. We are not robots. Further more we ask ourselves questions such as Where do we come from? What is the meaning of life? extra., Why? Because God has instilled in our DNA to search for him. An all powerful creator such as God all loving and merciful loves his creation so much, God wants us to find him.",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"Free will is an illusion created by humans watching our own brains work. Humans are animals - like dogs, but we're a bit smarter, so we can better predict what consequences our actions might have. Our brains make decisions based on these calculations (just like a dog's brain), but the kicker, and it's been experimentally shown, is that our brain makes decisions BEFORE we are consciously aware of the decision. Therefore while we feel like we have free will because we feel our brains making decisions, we actually have no more free will than dogs or ants, who respond to their environment with the best reactions their DNA and previous experience can muster. Just like humans.",0,0

HYWiIWpcCIM,"Free will is not equivalent to indeterminism. If nature followed certain probabilities (which it probably does to some extent), how would we be in control of anything? Whether it is determined or pure randomness doesn't matter at all for the decisions we make. Their origin is not us.",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,The thing is that you can make many things like exercising  and improving your life but this isnt free will,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"IMO free will exists simultaneously with determinism. What is free will but our choices, and what are our choices but the deliberation over different courses of action before a singular decision is made -- a singular decision which is the specific and necessary result of an individual's biology (including neurology), environment, and history. When we deliberate about a choice we're searching our knowledge of the world to see what the best course of action would be. There's nothing about that process which is incompatible with a world where the interaction of matter and energy follows physical laws of necessity",0,0

HYWiIWpcCIM,"The future will always ultimately have one outcome ; at some point, one event out of many choices will come to pass. True free will is impossible for your singular, subjective experience because of this very nature of time and life.\\n\\nUltimately, it doesn't really matter. The illusion of freewill has been with you up to this point and you've been as okay as can be expected. I feel this video misses the point of the question.",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,This is the first down vote i gave to School of life but the title is Do We Have Free Will or Are We Predetermined? and the video is about what we should believe to fell better not about how it is in reality.

HYWiIWpcCIM,"This is the worst video I have seen by the sol.\\n\\nDeterminism is not a choice and free will is not real. Those who still argue this are just in denial about their lack of agency and the inevitable damage that realisation does to ones ego.\\n\\nOur existences were predetermined at the birth of the universe and no amount of stoicism will change that. \\n\\nThe argument over which view to take is far less important at an individual level than when we apply it to our judgements of others. It is the difference between voting to cut benefits for the disabled because we think that they just need to be more determined about finding a job, or not because we accept that life success is not all personal choice.\\n\\nBeing rats directed around a maze by stimuli we can't perceive, only one benefit can be gained by understanding our lack of free will. That is that we use the knowledge to foster more compassionate attitudes to one another and aim wherever possible to create environments that can positively influence those subjected to them.\\n\\nWe don't chose our lives but we have no choice but to go along with the delusion. So we let the knowledge of our truth shape our pseudo decisions for the betterment of the collective reality and hope that it is our destiny to succeed.",0,0

As planets orbit your natal settings, they alter things but by and large you can literally see how things will unravel by looking at someone's chart and transits.",2,0

Where free will comes into play, is that by choice of our hearts and actions, this determines whether we will be in the “first” resurrection (being rewarded), or go through the correctional punishment, and then part of the “last” resurrection.",0,1

It's like he needs some day off but he can't not like us we do get plenty of rests but Louis kinda doesn't. Everyone is saying things like Make another music video! all he wants is us to understand that he needs more rest and he wants less stress like us.

qRoVlH1OcI4,It's the fucking anthem they're not kneeling for the pledge. All the anthem represents is how great America is. They're actually showing the same amount of respect by kneeling of course the ones that sit are kinda of disrespectful but the ones kneeling are very respectful. They aren't acting like it doesn't exist they are prostesting. You guys get mad when blacks protest someone dying by yelling through cities but when they do it peacefully you still get mad? You're basically saying blacks shouldn't be aloud to protest because both ways are wrong. This is more unamerican then not standing,0,0

oKzFGhlFqqE,This is the standard in our culture if your wealthy you get away with things as people try to carry favor with you by helping you out yet eventually it comes to light thankfully our society is improving slowly yet we must realize that there is more good in a group then bad like not all men are like trump all whites are not like white nationalist not all republicans support trump not all blacks sell drugs pick any stereotype or bigoted ideal however in order for this to be realized it’s not enough to say oh I find this horrible you must act it can be as simple as seeing someone being made uncomfortable an instead of ignoring it step into stop it additionally if you make a mistake own up to an then work to rectify it,0,1
oKzFGhlFqqE,"Word is that this talking head has witnessed Harvey Weinstein showering many times. Clearly, he's upset that Harv prefers women. Poor Seth has become a woman scorned.",0,0

oKzFGhlFqqE,"If Hillary had been elected Weinstein would have probably kept going. She's into WAYY darker stuff than him. And to be clear, on the scale of evil, in America's elite circles, harassing or assaulting 25 women is peanuts ... oh ... does that offend you? Good. Because there is REAL actual evil out there just carrying on, every day, meanwhile we crucify this idiot and think there are life lessons and social change to come from it. Anyone who changes how they live their lives because of this story is a blithering idiot. Sorry : )",0,0
oKzFGhlFqqE,"Wow, the attempt to associate Harvey with Trump has already begun. Harvey was as left as they come, nothing in common with Trump whatsoever, more like the rest of the entertainment business then anyone else, YET somehow now we see his picture in the same shot with Trumps. This is classic denial, misdirection, and blame shifting. Total propaganda piece right here.",0,0

oKzFGhlFqqE,oh sure tie trump to this scumbag wienstien. what a load of crap. Seth is just a typical liberal lying peace of ecrement. So damn sick of this incessant dribble from all the Hollywood and media scum. No wonder people are sick of this crap. 2018 is going to be rough on the democratics if this crap continues. I have to go puke now.,1,1
oKzFGhlFqqE,I'm not a Trump fan but geez you can't say a thing about a woman or you will be deemed sexist. \nTrump often called Ted Cruz a nasty guy. Trump called Hillary a nasty woman and that's considered sexist. Stop making women victims all the time. Otherwise the Republicans will keep winning.\nWe need to stop name calling because it's mostly fake news and Trump is going to win again. Look at all the thumbs down this video got. Seth is grasping at straws. He use to be soooo funny. What happened????,0,0
oKzFGhlFqqE,"What does the behaviour of a few men have to do with alleged systemic sexism? I wonder if these assholes will ever take on the pervasive, and actual, systemic discrimination and sexism against men under Family Law and in divorce court. Hopefully not, since the humour here leaves much to be desired, they'd probably just suck at doing it anyway like they suck at this.",0,0

oKzFGhlFqqE,"Also, of course Weinstein expects to get away with it. It's not like he harassed and raped all those women last weekend. He's gotten away with for *years*. Because women are not believed and are expected to put up with this man-child whiny toddler routine. Because boys will be boys right?\\n\\nUgh, infuriating. At least men are starting to speak up--figures like Seth Meyers and Colbert and such that has large audiences.",0,0
oKzFGhlFqqE,"Weinstein fucked some and harassed many high profile A-list actresses. only powerful and successful women came out but i think there are many others who were silenced. However now I know that all the outwardly beauty and charm is only one side of the success, the other side being sexually harassed by powerful men to become successful. Comparing them with what Trump did is a diversion from the whole matter.",0,0

oKzFGhlFqqE,"So easy to point the finger and in regards to male entitlement we have no entitlement in 2017 and i for one believe in equality if not specifically the toxic version of woman's lib we now see, the law society and especially the left is ready to crucify anyone with views opposed to their constantly and unimaginatively run mill of tags for each and everything they do not understand and feel threatened by and obviously this includes individuality. Seth  you are but a parrot and leave me unimpressed, not only that but because you are unable to stomach people who are  able to handle being what they are which in some cases mean masculine then that is an issue of your own.",0,0

oKzFGhlFqqE,Give credit to the less-powerful men who harass women with sexual comments and physical assault. Don’t save it all for the sexually predatory celebrities!  Men don’t listen to women so it’s up to men to come together and speak out. There are so many decent men but if they remain silent the disregard for the humanity of women will never stop.,0,0
oKzFGhlFqqE,"Both Trump and Weinstein are two perverted birds of a feather,\\nin prison with matching orange jumpsuits they'll look good together.\\nHere on Earth their wealth and power will help them both get away,\\nthough after life SATAN may say, It's here in HELL you two shall stay!\\n\\nQ: Where do Trump and Clinton's vacation location overlap?\\n\\n A: On Jeff Epstein's pedophile island. \\n\\nMaybe despite the left/right rhetoric these establishment politicians (Trump/Clinton) and their major donors (Ailes/Weinstein) aren't all that different; power hungry narcissists who get off by dominating women and those weaker than them. Pretty typical behavior for clinical narcissists. Hope that there actually is an Earth deity called SATAN to punish these wicked powerful men in HELL as they will likely escape justice here.",0,0

PUlfvXaISvc,"What a nutty idea, $274M for a wind farm of a lousy 30MW. So $274M/30MW=$9.1K per peak kw or $26k per avg delivered kw , not including the 3X oversized transmission lines and the unavoidable backup/storage high cost. Hinkley Point capital cost is $26B for 3.2 GW @ a 90% CF% = $9k per delivered avg kw of output or  The avg cost of the last 6 Offshore Wind Farms built in Britain was $4.9k per peak kw. And avg 37% CF% = $4.9/.37 = $13.2k per avg delivered kw = $13.2/$9k = 1.5X the cost of Hinkley. That's for FOAK, First-Of-A-Kind nuclear, not like the well established, 1000th of a kind, factory produced, fully mature, Wind Turbines. And I hate the EPR, we should be going full out on factory built, meltdown proof Molten Salt Reactors, that is the future, the EPR is an expensive, over-engineered dinosaur Nuclear Tech. If we are going to continue with these expensive EPRs and AP1000s we might as well just rent power off of Russian or Chinese built offshore nuclear barges at 1/3rd to 1/2 the cost of the EPR or AP1000.  \\n\\nFed up with the French EPR, Finland opted for the Russian VVER-1200 with a guaranteed price of 50 Euros per MWh, 1/3rd the price of Offshore Wind and a six year build time. Far greater rate of electricity growth, for reliable 24/7 electricity close to demand centers than can be done with part time renewables.\\n\\nExcept the Wind turbines supply a low grade intermittent power that lasts for 8-20 yrs vs Hinkley a high grade reliable power that lasts for 60-100yrs. And the Wind doesn't replace any infrastructure, in fact it ADDS infrastructure due to intermittency, and will not replace any of the vast fossil infrastructure, you still need all the power plants, maintained manned and often fired up, building steam, all the vast natural gas pipelines, production wells, fracking sites, storage, oil infrastructure, tankers, military, coal mines, rail cars, LNG tankers, the works. That is a huge investment & maintenance cost. So all solar and wind does is replace a bit of NG fuel worth 2 cents a kwh in the USA.\\n\\nAnd now the EU has finally approved the South Korean APR-1400 for use in Europe. They are building four APR-1400's in UAE, starting from scratch, construction began in July 2012, first reactor to be finished this year, ahead of schedule, all four 5.6 GWe operating in 2020, generating 31X the energy of this incessantly hyped in Big Oil's controlled media, Hornsea 2 offshore wind farm, built by DONG = Danish Oil & Natural Gas company. Except the wind requires fossil shadowing power (~80% fossil), the Nuclear needs no fossil.  And Hornsea 2 @ a cost of $7.9B for avg 670MW or $11.8B/GWavg vs the APR-1400's @ $20B for avg 5.2 GW or $3.9B/GWavg or 32% of the cost. Except the nuclear is reliable 24/7, windy/calm, summer/winter, cold spell/hot spell power for 60-100yrs vs the wind lasting for 8-20yrs. And then there is the Nuscale, Terrapower and ThorCon SMRs which are factory built, deliverable Nuclear modules. So in fact there should be no problem supplying all of EU's electricity demand and additional EV electricity demand with Nuclear power. With the Nuclear having reliable, continuous surplus power at nighttime when the EVs are charging. So Nuclear will be able to supply all electricity demand with maximum grid efficiency and no need of either storage or fossil backup.",2,1

qvXXMsiQBDg,"THE MEANING OF THE SONG (my opinion) he is rich he is handsome and we all come to the conclusion that he is happy and living a life that we can only dream of. The newspaper articles and photos show how happy he is .Well. Even though it might sound crazy he goes through the same pain the same shit like we do. His problems and pains are nothing but more complicated and huge than ours. Just like us sometimes he wants someone to hold on to . Someone to believe. But I'm pretty sure he can't differenciate the people who loves him and who loves his fame and money. He is infact lonely sometimes. The pressure he going through is unbelievable. His EVRY move is calculated, critized and just a small mistake could end up being a controversy. Louis I'm praying for you. Please don't crack under the pressure. Graphite can turn into diamond under huge huge pressure but it can also crack!!!!so far u did great be the same in the future.

HYWiIWpcCIM,"But in my research, it seems like there is both free will and determinism at the same time.  Reality is random (pure mathematical randomness, as seen in Pascal's triangle) with all possible combinations of matter and energy being covered, somewhere, somewhen, in all possible universes.  This is a determinstic process, with a simple division and recombination of patterns where every division splits reality into two universes, and every recombination bringing some universes back together, like river tributaries flowing down a mountain.  The free will comes in with the fact that it's all a random process, and you can't know what will happen next in one timeline, even if you could know all the possible past timelines combined.  Which we don't.  So life is unpredictable, and the more complex an individual is, the more unpredictable they are.  Thus humans, and dogs, and cats, and birds, and my Android phone, are free to do all kinds of weird things, and no one will ever be able to predict them.",0,0

HYWiIWpcCIM,"Free will is just a silly illusion dreamt up to feed the ego of human beings, there’s no reasoning behind it aside from making me feel good about myself. But because Time and the Future are things that actually do exist, then free will is something that cannot exist. For example in the future i am going to Die, and there’s nothing i can do about that, regardless if i take care of myself eat healthy exercise etc: my death date is already set in the future, and I don’t have any power to change it. I can’t add a year or take a year from my life no matter how hard i try, and because the moment of my death is already set in stone because the future exist where i die, that tells us that there’s no control of anything else either. Because everyone is ultimately doomed to die, and the day of their death does exist because the future Does exist, then free will cannot exist.

HYWiIWpcCIM,"What people don't seem to understand here is that he's not arguing that free will exists. He's arguing that propagating the idea that free will doesn't exist can be harmful. And in making this claim, he's rendering the question of free will's existence to a mere curiosity and not something of significance. Certainly if free will doesn't exist, the illusion of it does. And this illusion is what allows human beings to conceive of the universe they occupy as well as what allows for the existence of morality.\\n\\nSo to people saying things like science should not lie to people about free will, your belief in what should or should not be done relies on your own inherent belief in free will. \\n\\nLong story short, if you're willing to tell people that free will doesn't exist, at least stress the importance of treating it as if it did.",0,0

They're actually showing the same amount of respect by kneeling of course the ones that sit are kinda of disrespectful but the ones kneeling are very respectful. They aren't acting like it doesn't exist they are prostesting. You guys get mad when blacks protest someone dying by yelling through cities but when they do it peacefully you still get mad?

But about a month later I was ready and 9 months after that our 2nd child (and only boy) was born. That was 9 years ago..I now have my oldest who is 15.. My rainbow baby Macon who is 9 and identical 3 1/2 yr old twin girls Justice and Liberty. Our bodies know whats going on love...the roller coaster ride sucks, but when it happens its amazing. And ps.. I still told everyone the day of that next round of pregnancy tests too lol...with the I hope it sticks this time :) muah! -Ellie Kingsley",0,0
BidMbVRT8NU,Many people commenting here would do well to go to 13:05 and pay attention. This is very difficult and they are both very brave.

BidMbVRT8NU,"I'm so sorry this happened to you.  It's happened to me twice. The first time, I was 5 weeks and I didn't know that I was pregnant until the bleeding and cramping started.  It just felt wrong so I went to the ER, and they were able to confirm everything. The 2nd time I was 18 weeks.  Everyone knew.  I was starting to show and needed surgery.  Breaking the news was definitely the hardest part, and i cried with you on that part of the vlog.  The experience has also made my husband and I stronger and closer.  I'm praying for you both. ❤",0,0

BidMbVRT8NU,"Sweet Shawn & hubbin - I am a 48 year old who first and foremost have to tell the two of you that your parents must be so proud and blessed at the way your personal greatest heartbreak and loss, has been handled with so much Grace, honesty and love. The absolute love and support you two show one another is awe inspiring! I am so sorry honey, as I know from personal experience, it’s hard as a woman not to look at yourself in some way and wonder, however, it’s so devastating yet very common. Unfortunately it’s one of those ugly things we go through and grow through. Don’t ever blame yourself doll. It’s all in God’s perfect timing. You are blessed to have such a beautiful love story that’s real. I send you both Blessings and prayers for healing in your hearts. Good luck with everything you do! You are both extraordinarily, gorgeous, talented people, and when you least expect it , you will have your miracle again..",0,0

BidMbVRT8NU,"Anyone else a little off put by the smiles? They both seem disingenuous... woman go through miscarriages after they hear the heartbeat.

BidMbVRT8NU,"I’m so sorry for what you went through. I went through the same 22 years ago for my first pregnancy which wasn’t planned either but if it happened then it happened. Miscarriages usually occur in the first trimester. Mine occurred at 12 weeks. I started spotting and cramping. Went to see my dr who did an ultrasound and blood work. It was the end of the day so they would call me the next day to let me know if I was miscarrying or not. Cramping and bleeding got worse making it hard to sleep. It was so sore, I wouldn’t wish it on my worse enemy. Called the dr who said to meet him at the ER. As I was walking to the car, I felt some discharge. It turned out to be tissue. I ended up having a D&C. It was hard and having to tell family was even harder. But like your dr said, don’t blame yourself. It’s nothing you did. It’s just nature’s way of saying it wasn’t time. I now have 2 daughters ages 20 & 16 and they were/are competitive gymnasts. Know that you’re not alone. You’ll make great parents one day. Wishing you the best. Aloha! 🤙🏽",0,0

We had our 12 week appointment and when they did the ultrasound we could see baby's heartbeat & him/her was wiggling around moving those legs & arms. There was abnormal things seen in my ultrasound & when they sent me to see a specialist at university of Iowa hospitals & clinics (yes I'm from Iowa too!) A week later, baby no longer had a heartbeat. It was the most devastating news, especially since we had just seen baby moving around 1 week prior. My heart goes out to you!

BidMbVRT8NU,Nobody talks about the pain of trying for kids. My wife and I did not get married for a few years so we could enjoy traveling and having fun as a couple. By the time we tried for kids. Most  of our friends had kids. And they were around 12 or so. We waited one year before trying for kids. We thought it would happen after a month or two. After 1 year we both got checked out. We both had problems. Ivf worked right away. We were pregnant with twins. 5 months later my wife lost twin boys due to a weak cervix. They lived for 1 hour. I was so devastated. I was so mad teens have kids and do not plan for them  and people abort babies. My poor wife went through 5 more failed IVF cycles. We were down to the last 4 and 2 made it. We had a boy and girl =) What made it hard was how insensitive people are. It took us 4 years and 50k plus to have kids. We would go to parties and people would tell us we should have kids by now. Or do you not want kids. Life was hard doing things without kids was boring since we did it all before we got married. Every event has kids related. I would tear up every time I saw my neighbors kids yell goodbye as they went to work. I had Dad who never spent time with me. I am the opposite. I spend all of the time with them.,0,0
BidMbVRT8NU,"I am so heart-broken to hear this devastating news! My husband and I personally know how hard it is on both. After we had been married for 3 years, we decided the time was finally right for us to have a baby. We got pregnant pretty quickly. We were so excited and couldn't wait to tell everyone and to start buying baby clothes. At about 8 weeks, I started spotting and eventually had a miscarriage. We were so devastated!!! What a Rollercoaster - going from pure joy to unimaginable sadness! During the next 2 years, we had 3 more miscarriages. It was so awful. Mother's Day each year was the worst. Seeing all of my friends have babies, having to go to other people's baby showers, and being around babies at church...all of those things were so difficult for us. Finally, the Lord blessed us with an AMAZING MIRACLE...our daughter!! About 3 years after our daughter was born, we decided to try for another baby. Once again, I miscarried. I decided I couldn't live through another roller-coaster of emotions so I was done. No more babies! But then after about 2 months, I found out I was pregnant, and we were blessed with ANOTHER MIRACLE - a beautiful baby boy! We had to so a lot of praying and reciting Bible verses during that period of our life. Through the years, the Lord has allowed me to help so many other women who have gone through the same thing. I will put you on my prayer list. If I you ever need someone who understands, feel free to reach out to me. God is in control, and He loves you. He will be there for you every step of the way. Thank you for sharing your story. I know this will help so many other women.\\nHe maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful mother of children.

PUlfvXaISvc,"Thank you Statoil and good luck to all involved with the Hywind Scotland floating wind farm project!\\nI have suggestions for integrating wind farms into the electricity grid so as to provide power on demand whatever the weather.\\nWind, storage and back-up system designer http://scottish.scienceontheweb.net/Wind%20power%20storage%20back-up%20calculator.htm?wind=30#wind \\nPeak demand, wind and back-up power / energy usage and storage capacity calculator\\nFor the specification and design of renewable energy electricity generation systems which successfully smooth intermittent wind generation to serve customer demand, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and 52 weeks a year.\\n\\n(Which recommends about 150MWh of energy storage capacity for a 30MW wind farm)\\n\\nScottish Scientist\\nIndependent Scientific Adviser for Scotland\\nhttps://scottishscientist.wordpress.com/",0,3
PUlfvXaISvc,"What a nutty idea, $274M for a wind farm of a lousy 30MW. So $274M/30MW=$9.1K per peak kw or $26k per avg delivered kw , not including the 3X oversized transmission lines and the unavoidable backup/storage high cost. Hinkley Point capital cost is $26B for 3.2 GW @ a 90% CF% = $9k per delivered avg kw of output or  The avg cost of the last 6 Offshore Wind Farms built in Britain was $4.9k per peak kw. And avg 37% CF% = $4.9/.37 = $13.2k per avg delivered kw = $13.2/$9k = 1.5X the cost of Hinkley. That's for FOAK, First-Of-A-Kind nuclear, not like the well established, 1000th of a kind, factory produced, fully mature, Wind Turbines. And I hate the EPR, we should be going full out on factory built, meltdown proof Molten Salt Reactors, that is the future, the EPR is an expensive, over-engineered dinosaur Nuclear Tech. If we are going to continue with these expensive EPRs and AP1000s we might as well just rent power off of Russian or Chinese built offshore nuclear barges at 1/3rd to 1/2 the cost of the EPR or AP1000.  \\n\\nFed up with the French EPR, Finland opted for the Russian VVER-1200 with a guaranteed price of 50 Euros per MWh, 1/3rd the price of Offshore Wind and a six year build time. Far greater rate of electricity growth, for reliable 24/7 electricity close to demand centers than can be done with part time renewables.\\n\\nExcept the Wind turbines supply a low grade intermittent power that lasts for 8-20 yrs vs Hinkley a high grade reliable power that lasts for 60-100yrs. And the Wind doesn't replace any infrastructure, in fact it ADDS infrastructure due to intermittency, and will not replace any of the vast fossil infrastructure, you still need all the power plants, maintained manned and often fired up, building steam, all the vast natural gas pipelines, production wells, fracking sites, storage, oil infrastructure, tankers, military, coal mines, rail cars, LNG tankers, the works. That is a huge investment & maintenance cost. So all solar and wind does is replace a bit of NG fuel worth 2 cents a kwh in the USA.\\n\\nAnd now the EU has finally approved the South Korean APR-1400 for use in Europe. They are building four APR-1400's in UAE, starting from scratch, construction began in July 2012, first reactor to be finished this year, ahead of schedule, all four 5.6 GWe operating in 2020, generating 31X the energy of this incessantly hyped in Big Oil's controlled media, Hornsea 2 offshore wind farm, built by DONG = Danish Oil & Natural Gas company. Except the wind requires fossil shadowing power (~80% fossil), the Nuclear needs no fossil.  And Hornsea 2 @ a cost of $7.9B for avg 670MW or $11.8B/GWavg vs the APR-1400's @ $20B for avg 5.2 GW or $3.9B/GWavg or 32% of the cost. Except the nuclear is reliable 24/7, windy/calm, summer/winter, cold spell/hot spell power for 60-100yrs vs the wind lasting for 8-20yrs. And then there is the Nuscale, Terrapower and ThorCon SMRs which are factory built, deliverable Nuclear modules. So in fact there should be no problem supplying all of EU's electricity demand and additional EV electricity demand with Nuclear power. With the Nuclear having reliable, continuous surplus power at nighttime when the EVs are charging. So Nuclear will be able to supply all electricity demand with maximum grid efficiency and no need of either storage or fossil backup.",2,1

The free will comes in with the fact that it's all a random process, and you can't know what will happen next in one timeline, even if you could know all the possible past timelines combined.  Which we don't.  So life is unpredictable, and the more complex an individual is, the more unpredictable they are.  Thus humans, and dogs, and cats, and birds, and my Android phone, are free to do all kinds of weird things, and no one will ever be able to predict them.",0,0

HYWiIWpcCIM,"As a hard determinist, I believe that even our thoughts and personal decisions are beyond our design. As we cannot control the biological and chemical functions of our brain, the traits given to us by our genetic code, or the external stimuli that influence us, since our consciousness, judgement, perception and decision making ability are directly tied to our brain (precisely our frontal lobe), and as there is no perceivable way to test the concept of free will (since time is unchangeable), the existence of free will, the concept of randomness, and the perception of ‘possibility’ are purely based on faith. Scientifically, every event can hypothetically be predicted through calculation, as all matter exists under the laws of nature and physics.",0,0

HYWiIWpcCIM,"I disagree with the way determinism is described in this video. It's talked about like it says that our lives are determined by the people and activities around us. I believe that determinism is the theory that absolutely everything is determined by the laws of nature. This brings me to two conclusions- One, that, given the exact same set of circumstances twice, the same result will be achieved, even with human thought or decision.\\nTwo, that, given knowledge of all things, present and past, literally EVERYTHING, a being could successfully predict the future with 100% accuracy.\\nSo for me, this video does not even discuss determinism. \\nWith my interpretation of determinism, there is no reason to change one's view or actions about the world, because it will not change anything. You just have to kind of ignore it and move on.",0,0

HYWiIWpcCIM,@The School Of Life ; Thank You so Much for giving Insight on this Issue. I had prevously written to you about this Particular Topic as I sought to find clarity and understanding about this. I am very much grateful for your response.,0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"What people don't seem to understand here is that he's not arguing that free will exists. He's arguing that propagating the idea that free will doesn't exist can be harmful. And in making this claim, he's rendering the question of free will's existence to a mere curiosity and not something of significance. Certainly if free will doesn't exist, the illusion of it does. And this illusion is what allows human beings to conceive of the universe they occupy as well as what allows for the existence of morality.\\n\\nSo to people saying things like science should not lie to people about free will, your belief in what should or should not be done relies on your own inherent belief in free will. \\n\\nLong story short, if you're willing to tell people that free will doesn't exist, at least stress the importance of treating it as if it did.",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"Our personality is the continuity of every decision we ever made. So free choice is crucial to identify as the person we are.\\nIf you believe in determinism, you believe that you never made any decisions in your life. There would be no difference, as everything is just the product of causality. \\nI know you can't prove one thing or the other, but i really have to believe in free will, otherwise it would drive me into depressions.",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,Free will doesn't exist and the Bible confirms it. Wannabe Christians who don't read the Bible believe in free will because they're retarded and believe in a horned red man who causes all the evil in the world. Directly contradicting the same God they claim to worship who says he does all good and evil in Isaiah 45:7. Romans in the New Testament declares God predestined people for salvation directly removing any chance of their being free will being predetermined events can't be enforced by any freedom of action even to the very least extent.,0,0

HYWiIWpcCIM,"I am confused here; is free will interpreted as claiming to have the power to control your life/future events? Or is the question more geared towards choice versus predetermination? To clarify, is our life predetermined and we only have the illusion of free will (choice) or do the choices we make change and affect future outcome? \\n\\nAs I feel is being discussed in this video this question has then been boiled down and changed in the course of making it more personal instead of general. But it does not answer my question or give insight on whether we actually posses something as free will, or that all is predetermined (by our brain functions/ some kind of god/ simulation theory).\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I'm not trying to say the video isn't good or that I know better (I know absolutely nothing and am no philosopher), in fact thumbs up for the time and effort spent in creating this video!",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"We do not have free will. It's an illusion, a lie. I want to be a film director. Went to school got a degree and guess what it doesn't matter how good you are or how hard you work or how educated you are. Others determine what you can do in life. Not YOURSELF. Your ability to kiss ass and suck up and sellout and be a sheep gets you further in life than being genuine. If others don't like you they want to see you fail instead of just leaving you alone. Our society is plagued with mental illness and no one wants to admit it. We make excuses. Do we have the courage to break free from this cookie cutter corporate run world or are we just meat for the grinder. You live you work you get to have fun once in a blue moon then you die. We are just cattle for the super rich. Always have been.",0,0
HYWiIWpcCIM,"Nothing is predestined. We are not robots. Further more we ask ourselves questions such as Where do we come from? What is the meaning of life? extra., Why?

HYWiIWpcCIM,"Free will is an illusion created by humans watching our own brains work. Humans are animals - like dogs, but we're a bit smarter, so we can better predict what consequences our actions might have. Our brains make decisions based on these calculations (just like a dog's brain), but the kicker, and it's been experimentally shown, is that our brain makes decisions BEFORE we are consciously aware of the decision. Therefore while we feel like we have free will because we feel our brains making decisions, we actually have no more free will than dogs or ants, who respond to their environment with the best reactions their DNA and previous experience can muster.

HYWiIWpcCIM,"Free will is just a silly illusion dreamt up to feed the ego of human beings, there’s no reasoning behind it aside from making me feel good about myself. But because Time and the Future are things that actually do exist, then free will is something that cannot exist. For example in the future i am going to Die, and there’s nothing i can do about that, regardless if i take care of myself eat healthy exercise etc: my death date is already set in the future, and I don’t have any power to change it. I can’t add a year or take a year from my life no matter how hard i try, and because the moment of my death is already set in stone because the future exist where i die, that tells us that there’s no control of anything else either. Because everyone is ultimately doomed to die, and the day of their death does exist because the future Does exist, then free will cannot exist. Without the ability to stop myself from dying, I do not have Free Will. Because the Future exist, all of my choices have already been made.",0,0

qRoVlH1OcI4,It's the fucking anthem they're not kneeling for the pledge. All the anthem represents is how great America is. They're actually showing the same amount of respect by kneeling of course the ones that sit are kinda of disrespectful but the ones kneeling are very respectful. They aren't acting like it doesn't exist they are prostesting. You guys get mad when blacks protest someone dying by yelling through cities but when they do it peacefully you still get mad? You're basically saying blacks shouldn't be aloud to protest because both ways are wrong. This is more unamerican then not standing,0,0
qRoVlH1OcI4,"The most despicable thing about this is that our President has the time to worry about Football, TV ratings, and Twitter.\\nMost Vets I know do not give a $#!T about this subject.  Freedom means we can peacefully protest any way we want.  Not standing for the Anthem doesn't mean you are not patriotic.

Now tell me who gets mad at ppl, even tho they have a right to do so for kneeling for a positive cause. It's ok to support a group of nazis, but not a group of ppl trying to get equality.

When he spoke about the Vegas shooting I actually could hear him speak like the leader of the free world and sounded truly inspiring. but then he goes right back to talking like a jock or some dumb rich kid. I have tried over and over this past year to give him a chance but I can't fucking do it any more.
