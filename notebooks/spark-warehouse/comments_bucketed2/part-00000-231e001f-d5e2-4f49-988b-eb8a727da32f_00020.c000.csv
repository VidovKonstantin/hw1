zPGRU49esCU,Hey. I used to live in St.Martin and have loads of friends who survived  Irma. Trust me they don't need to cook there these days. Food is not what they worry about most.

zPGRU49esCU,"I have a good tuna salad & some other ideas... I am just hoping this helps someone. I'm sure there's a TON of people on here who have family in FL, I know I do. My tuna salad goes great on any kind of cracker, bread, in a tomato, lettuce, or wrap. Especially for people trying to stretch a meal while packing in a lot of vitamins or just use up veggies. The majority of these things will last out of the fridge and even though there is quite a bit of prep, it's totally worth it. You can even just throw all of it on a sandwich in a pinch and get the same flavor. \\n\\nI came up with this about a year ago when my husband and I were down on our luck and I was trying to pack a bunch of nutrition, & bulk into an affordable meal.\\n\\nAnyways, I normally use 2-3 cans of tuna, if you only have 1 can, just use that! I've done it before, and it still worked perfectly. My cats usually get part of the can. It's also another way to feed your pets if you need to. Lol So I hit the drained tuna immediately with the juice of 1 lemon. If you don't have lemon, use red wine or some other kind of vinegar. Then add 1/2 - 1Chopped red onion, 1 chopped green bell pepper, 1 seeded chopped tomato or a handful of cherry/grape tomatoes, both sweet & kosher dill pickles chopped, or relish, S&P everything and add a touch of mayo. You could even omit the Mayo if you wanted. The veggies and the lemon juice add enough moisture which cuts back on the amount of mayo needed. The acid from the lemon cuts through the fishyness as well. I have also added celery to this and have topped it with provolone. Could be a great vegg friendly item for people who don't like to eat tuna.\\n\\nAnother great idea with tuna and or leftover pasta. You can always make tuna salad for 1 day or meal, then make a pasta salad the next. If you cooked a couple days prior to your power being knocked out, it's possible that you already have cooked pasta. If you have frozen peas, add those in with a simple tuna salad made with something along the lines of tuna, lemon juice and zest or vinegar, red onion, and dill weed, or dill pickles. It's another way to stretch something you've already made or use up something you have already. \\nThis pasta salad can go so many different directions. You could do a Greek or Italian style, cold/room temp pasta salad with different cheeses, deli meats and veggies. Adding things like spinach to bulk it up. If you add cheese, you should eat it asap obviously.\\nYou could even do a veggie wrap with peanut sauce...",0,1

Glad to see people get excited about something and yes the price tag sounds expensive but if you think about these phones are pretty much miniaturized computers that allow us to do business and personal things.

9YyB6sQ4iwA,"The iPhone X is a rip off. It doesn't offer IP68 water resistance like the Note 8, or Galaxy S8, or heck even the Galaxy S7 for that matter. It doesn't have a headphone jack and instead requires an easy to lose dongle and gives you yet more stuff to carry around that a $1,000 phone should not require. Yeah that dongle screams premium. /)_<\\n\\nThe iPhone X does not support fast charging out of the box and requires you to buy two more adapters to carry around in addition to your headphone dongle just to get it to work and yet even more money spent. \\n\\nThe iPhone X now supports wireless charging! Yea! But unlike the Galaxy S8/Note 8 does not support fast wireless charging. \\n\\niPhone X starts out at $999.99 before tax and offers no MicroSD card slot for expansion, instead forcing you to spend $150.00 more for 256GB, which is still less memory than what you would get had the 64GB iPhone X just supported MicroSD cards. You could have popped in a 256GB card and had 320GB of storage for that same $150 upgrade. And it would be removable! Just pop it into your desktop for simple copy and paste file transfer to a hard drive and your done. But nope, you need to wire up to your PC and use the cluttered iTunes program, or the incredibly slow data munching cloud service to transfer files. \\n\\nSo who wants to take bets that the new improved camera on the iPhone X will still record all audio in mono sound when shooting a video, instead of Stereo like every other phone. (In 2017 the iPhone 7 still records in mono.) \\n\\nAnd so much for that OLED screen. I said that Samsung doesn't sell their best AMOLED screens to competitors, as the Galaxy gets the best of the best. I was right.  \\n\\nThe Note 8 has a Super AMOLED display that produces over 1,200 nits of brightness and has a 2,960 x 1,440P, 6.3 inch display, with a pixel density of 522. The Galaxy Note8 is certified by the UHD Alliance for Mobile HDR Premium. And it has full 100% DCI-P3 Color Gamut. \\n\\nThe iPhone X has a 5.8 inch display (5.15 usable) with a resolution of 2,436 x 1,135 (Apple calls this a Super Retina display.)\\nThe display has a nit brightness of 625. (It won't be as viewable on sunny days in comparison to the Note 8 which is 2X brighter.) \\n\\nThe iPhone X screen has a pixel density of 458 PPI. \\n\\nThe iPhone X uses very cumbersome and likely not truly reliable face unlock tech for mobile payments and access to your phone. It also has support for traditional pass words which would be the wiser of the two main options. \\n\\nThe Galaxy S8/Note 8 also have face unlock, in addition to Retina unlocking and passwords. Plus they have very reliable fingerprint scanners unlike the iPhone X for access to the phone and for mobile payments.   \\n\\nAnd finally the Note 8 and the iPhone X both support Augmented Reality tech. However only the Galaxy S8/Note 8 support proper VR.\\n\\nSo is the iPhone X worth a $1,000.00??? Not in my opinion. Especially since the iPhone X isn't a $1,000.00 when purchased. You have to figure this → $999.99 + say Wisconsin sales tax of 5.1% for example if you just happen to live in that state. Now the phone costs $1,050.99 + those spiffy adapters that you need to purchase for your fast charging, which brings you up to another $75.00 or so. Plus now add $200.00 for Apple Care+ and finally you may need a case, so there 's another $35.00 ~ $75.00 for you. So realistically your spending about $1,400 for the phone. \\n\\nSo should you buy the iPhone X? That's up to you. It's your money. To each their own. \\nShow less\\nREPLY",0,0
9YyB6sQ4iwA,The real question and I hope you make a video of is Face ID vs Touch ID. A lot of people such as myself feel like they should've made Touch ID an option and implemented either on the back or power button (which is no longer the name of it.) how can people like myself look pass Touch ID and learn to adapt to Face ID.

But he is the Jay Cutler of the NBA by SAS standards. All the talent, weapon on offense, but doesn't make anyone better and can't lead a team. Carmelo should be a solid #3 option to depend.

-JmNKGfFj7w,"He knows its all a meaningless illusion. All genius creative people come to this conclusion. Just saw 'End of the tour,' about David Foster Wallace. This writer sums up the meaninglessness of awards ceremonies. 'Is this who we are? A binge-watching, technologically-sedated mass with an almost religious conviction that instant celebrity and spiritual contentment are one and the same. “Is this who we are?” is a question that will not be getting asked on this year’s red carpet. The questions asked will remain the same empty, salivating ones that were asked on last year’s red carpet: “Tell us about that designer outfit you have on, how surprised were you to be nominated, and of course who do you think will win?” We already know what the stock answers will be: “It’s such an honor to be here. A dream come true. Wish me luck.” The End of the Tour ends with a plaintive cry into this celebrity-obsessed wilderness. ' http://www.huffingtonpost.com/allen-callaci/the-oscars-get-it-all-wrong_b_9015408.html \\nSo Jim Carey isnt crazy, he's just on the same page as every one else who's realised the meaninglessness of entertainment obsessed culture. we're gonna have to develop some real machinery inside our guts... to turn off pure, unalloyed pleasure. Or, I don't know about you, I'm gonna have to leave the planet. 'Cause the technology is just gonna get better and better. And it's gonna get easier and easier... and more and more convenient and more and more pleasurable... to sit alone with images on a screen... given to us by people who do not love us but want our money.

zPGRU49esCU,"I have a good tuna salad & some other ideas... I am just hoping this helps someone. I'm sure there's a TON of people on here who have family in FL, I know I do. My tuna salad goes great on any kind of cracker, bread, in a tomato, lettuce, or wrap. Especially for people trying to stretch a meal while packing in a lot of vitamins or just use up veggies. The majority of these things will last out of the fridge and even though there is quite a bit of prep, it's totally worth it. You can even just throw all of it on a sandwich in a pinch and get the same flavor. \\n\\nI came up with this about a year ago when my husband and I were down on our luck and I was trying to pack a bunch of nutrition, & bulk into an affordable meal.\\n\\nAnyways, I normally use 2-3 cans of tuna, if you only have 1 can, just use that! I've done it before, and it still worked perfectly. My cats usually get part of the can. It's also another way to feed your pets if you need to. Lol So I hit the drained tuna immediately with the juice of 1 lemon. If you don't have lemon, use red wine or some other kind of vinegar. Then add 1/2 - 1Chopped red onion, 1 chopped green bell pepper, 1 seeded chopped tomato or a handful of cherry/grape tomatoes, both sweet & kosher dill pickles chopped, or relish, S&P everything and add a touch of mayo. You could even omit the Mayo if you wanted. The veggies and the lemon juice add enough moisture which cuts back on the amount of mayo needed. The acid from the lemon cuts through the fishyness as well. I have also added celery to this and have topped it with provolone. Could be a great vegg friendly item for people who don't like to eat tuna.\\n\\nAnother great idea with tuna and or leftover pasta. You can always make tuna salad for 1 day or meal, then make a pasta salad the next. If you cooked a couple days prior to your power being knocked out, it's possible that you already have cooked pasta. If you have frozen peas, add those in with a simple tuna salad made with something along the lines of tuna, lemon juice and zest or vinegar, red onion, and dill weed, or dill pickles. It's another way to stretch something you've already made or use up something you have already. \\nThis pasta salad can go so many different directions. You could do a Greek or Italian style, cold/room temp pasta salad with different cheeses, deli meats and veggies. Adding things like spinach to bulk it up. If you add cheese, you should eat it asap obviously.\\nYou could even do a veggie wrap with peanut sauce...",0,1

9YyB6sQ4iwA,"I just don't  understand what you mean by Worth it. Let's break it down. It is an overpriced product, like most of everything that Apple sells. It doesn't have any true innovation. The cut out at the top is a complete utter blasphemy for anyone who has a keen eye for design and knows what functionality is and how it works. Without losing any screen real estate, are you for real? With the cut out you loose part of the real estate in mostly anything you do on the phone and you can save the but you can make it smaller so that you don't loose anything on it NO! It's not ideal and it's not functional, so why make the customer do it  when  you could've done it in the design? Augmented reality? That's been done by Microsoft, Nokia, Sony, Google, may I keep going? Microsoft has a whole department on it. Face ID? It's a really risky and bad move from Apple. It isn't even that reliable, can they better it? Yeah, but why get rid of a clearly secure way to secure your phone for something you haven't even perfected? And don't come at me with it was sacrificed for the screen and put more features on it. WRONG! Samsung's Note 8 and S8/+ have the bezeless effect and have Iris scanner, facial recognition, a headphone Jack, a fingerprint scanner on the back and it's IP68, hence on the 68, all on one phone. The LG V30 also has all of that with a quality DAC  on board. So please, do people a favor and actually present products with an honest and not biased opinion. The phone is not worth $999 or up. It's recycled technology, cramped on a shell that has people thinking is a luxury and exclusive brand. It has fast charging on board but you have to pay for it? That's like an $90 charge, extra from the $999 for the base model. The phone doesn't get bright with only like 625 nits on it, the note 8 goes for 1200 nits, Double that!!!!! Is the note 8 worth $950? Yes, but it has way more features, good quality headphones out of the box, better design, functional as well, you don't need to pay for the features. And I could go on... pleaseeeeee do humanity a favor and inform with the truth and don't over hype a product that is not worth the money. You might be able to buy it or probably be able to get it from Apple if they pay you off for a good review, but don't sell a dream for people who don't have the money to bug something overpriced and completely not worth it.",0,0

9YyB6sQ4iwA,"I just don't  understand what you mean by Worth it. Let's break it down. It is an overpriced product, like most of everything that Apple sells. It doesn't have any true innovation. The cut out at the top is a complete utter blasphemy for anyone who has a keen eye for design and knows what functionality is and how it works. Without losing any screen real estate, are you for real? With the cut out you loose part of the real estate in mostly anything you do on the phone and you can save the but you can make it smaller so that you don't loose anything on it NO! It's not ideal and it's not functional, so why make the customer do it  when  you could've done it in the design? Augmented reality? That's been done by Microsoft, Nokia, Sony, Google, may I keep going? Microsoft has a whole department on it. Face ID? It's a really risky and bad move from Apple. It isn't even that reliable, can they better it? Yeah, but why get rid of a clearly secure way to secure your phone for something you haven't even perfected? And don't come at me with it was sacrificed for the screen and put more features on it. WRONG! Samsung's Note 8 and S8/+ have the bezeless effect and have Iris scanner, facial recognition, a headphone Jack, a fingerprint scanner on the back and it's IP68, hence on the 68, all on one phone. The LG V30 also has all of that with a quality DAC  on board. So please, do people a favor and actually present products with an honest and not biased opinion. The phone is not worth $999 or up. It's recycled technology, cramped on a shell that has people thinking is a luxury and exclusive brand. It has fast charging on board but you have to pay for it? That's like an $90 charge, extra from the $999 for the base model. The phone doesn't get bright with only like 625 nits on it, the note 8 goes for 1200 nits, Double that!!!!! Is the note 8 worth $950? Yes, but it has way more features, good quality headphones out of the box, better design, functional as well, you don't need to pay for the features. And I could go on... pleaseeeeee do humanity a favor and inform with the truth and don't over hype a product that is not worth the money. You might be able to buy it or probably be able to get it from Apple if they pay you off for a good review, but don't sell a dream for people who don't have the money to bug something overpriced and completely not worth it.",0,0

She then makes up a convoluted compromise out of hope. Apple users deserve better. They really seem like they're being mistreated and mislead and being given less than what they deserve.

KCiahBMis1E,"Wow, what a great run. Great cr, great driver. For those complaining about it being an empty shell with a roll cage, yeah well that's still a sedan, and their point here isn't to break a record of a street legal car. I assume the goal was to break the record of a Sedan body car, at all costs. Hence the 600 ponies, nearly double that of a factory STi. I say job well done. Oh and to have Prodrive in the video brings back memories. Those glorious late nineties .. Subaru for life!! 💪💪",0,0

KCiahBMis1E,"I guess you could call it a sedan...the roll cage is in the way of the rear doors...I don't think there's even a back seat. Sedan body style, sure. I understand that to get it to sub 7's, the interior and insulation needed to be ditched. I however, do not believe this vehicle can be used to do anything normal anymore. I don't even think it's street legal, as it was when it set the time, here in america. It's now a purpose built TA livery. Good job goes to Richie for not having a subaru yard sale. I guess I set my standards too high...not a lot of production vehicles can go from dealership lot, to Nordschleife TA, without modification, and set a decent lap time.",1,2

R6ja9qNmOaM,Yeah this poll was a whole big pile of 💩!!,0,0
R6ja9qNmOaM,The thing is.. Look at Melo and his game he's just one of the best. throughout every season he's proved to be great and the fact that they put a rookie Mr. 1 round 2nd pick over him (who currently has NO score or dunks or rebounds or assist or anything in the NBA for the past 15 years) is flat out ridiculous! Melo deserves better and I find it disrespectful to put a rookie who's about to barely play his first NBA game is fucking horseshit.,0,0

R6ja9qNmOaM,There's more to basketball than scoring. Not a team player,0,0
R6ja9qNmOaM,Honestly I'd put Harrison Barnes over Melo at this point. Their offensive stats were quite similar last year with 'Melo only being slightly better and Barnes can play defense. When you also consider that Barnes is likely to improve next year still being rather young and now having a year of experience as a no. 1 option under his belt and the 'Melo could quite possibly decline next year considering he's 33 and will be 34 at the end of the season I think putting Barnes over him is perfectly reasonable.,0,0

So I guess guys like AI, T-Mac, Grant Hill & Charles Barkley our trash 2(smh)...Carmelo is a top  15-20 player and top 5 scorer, some of y'all need 2 do your homework and if you don't believe me just go back and watch how Melo and the nuggets knocked my Mavs out the playoffs in 2009 or how he took it to the Heat a couple of years ago in the playoffs(his team the knicks weren't consistent but he brought it every game),he plays for a really bad organization not his fault the Knicks suck. #RealFacts",0,0

pyZVUC5jeVw,"It's so sad to see Lawrence dating this up himself director. He's not a good influence. You can tell she's trying so desperately hard to impress him - her mentioning Jane Eyre and Wide Sargasso Sea and all that allegories and metaphors bollocks  - and you can tell he's all smug and self satisfied about it...which says a lot about his maturity as a man who's pushing 50. I detest men like him. They pride themselves on being auteurs, intellectuals and open minded, but really they're just manipulative, crypto misogynists, who parade around pretending to be liberals when it suits them.  She's quick to slag off Trump in interviews and she's right, I can't stand Trump, but at least it's obvious that he's a see you next tuesday.  These soft spoken Aronofsy types are slippery as fresh dog shit on a rainy day.  Lawrence should date men her own age and just learn the craft of film making for men like...Aron off putting ski. She doesn't have to sell herself short by sleeping with him. She's a friggin Oscar winning actress and a millionaire for crying out loud.",74,19
pyZVUC5jeVw,"If you see the chemistry between her and Chris Pratt, when they were promoting Passengers. Then you come and see this, you have to wonder what the fuck is going on?

pyZVUC5jeVw,"She's so desperately trying to justify her bae's inclination for brutalizing women in his films with that whole feminist blabbering bs 🙄 this is not a feminist film, no one needs to pointlessly depict so much abuse. I, and all women, already know that violence against us exists, so no thanks captain obvious. Showing a woman who is raped and in the process decides she is enjoying it helps no women, only Aronofsky benefits from using this as a tool for shocking easily shockable people, which is in line with the intellectual weakness of his criticism to the issue of violence against women or against mother earth. JLaw's justification made no sense, even she knows trying to present this movie as a feminist critique to whatever is just trying too hard. The worst thing is that all the trendy outlets will mindlessly repeat her words for clickbait. They also need to get down that privileged universal, biblical train because the judeo cristian myth is not accepted everywhere in the world, so it is simply not true that they are working with methaphors and allegories of universal reach.",0,0

It's sad really, that actors are expected to be incredibly lucid and have all these amazing ideas and opinions, when really they don't have to be! She plays a character, she didn't create the film.\\n She should talk about how she delved into the character...how she portrayed her, how she truly felt about the story. That's what is unique to her, not what she has trained to say, not the directors noble intentions for the film. Instead she (and other actors who these days keep trying to signal how intelligent they are) gives non-sensical, overly wordy, meaningless platitudes about what the film 'means'. Sorry for rantin, but honestly check out every interview for any major recent successful film bf the actors all have these weird rambled talks about what the film means and it's both funny and boring.",0,0
pyZVUC5jeVw,"I came to find out more about the movie and I'm very confused by the title which has nothing to do with the interview and even more confused with the comment section.

My state, the highest recorded temp was 81 years ago/113 degrees, the highest recorded national temp in America, 134 degrees 100 years ago in Death Valley and it's never been hotter since then. All the other states I checked, 55 years ago, 81 years ago etc... so there must be 'isolated regional polar region warming' because it sure the fuck isn't getting universally/globally hotter anywhere. The sea levels had record lows recently/last five years lol, every single basic observation refutes the 'climate change/oxymoronic' claims. Yes the climate does in fact change! always has. Hot air rises and aggregates where? the equator/tropic zones so it would effect temperatures from the center of the Earth all the way to the polar regions, thus it should be getting hotter on average EVERYWHERE, it isn't as my common sense observations proved. Just research the hottest day in your state, I guarantee it will have been 60-100 years ago.",0,0

Going back to Passengers, I don't think Jennifer should have ever apologized that she went for that script or even talked about how people 'hate' her movies because it didn't sit well with the critics.

Es triste saber que la mujer que crecí admirando, mi ídolo, mi inspiración, murió y parece que nadie se da cuenta. Shakira perdió ese algo que la hacía única (de tal modo que se apoya en otros para hacer sus trabajos, a Shakira nunca se le vio tan dependiente de otros artistas, es incapaz de defenderse sola fuera de su sona de comfort), que la hacía especial, perdió su esencia, se volvió vulgar, perdió su inocencia, perdió ese sentimiento: ¿Hace cuánto no llora cantando sus canciones?... Yo sólo digo que Shakira tiene que haberse perdido a sí misma, terminó convirtiéndose en otra artista comercial, y quizás físicamente no esté muerta, pero qué peor muerte que caer en la indeferencia y falsedad por encajar en un mundo que va evolucionando, qué peor muerte que el negarse a uno mismo.",1,3

2y7rk7eHHAM,"Well, it seems my United Democratic Republic of Korea is the correct idea concerning North Korea (9 provinces). So, Nostradamus mentions in the Quatrain - C1:Q81 - is telling me something else. He made a big mistake by eliminating Jang Song-Thaek as he is mentioned within the triad letters (K.Th.L.). Jang Song-Thaek was executed in 2013. So, this means a group within the military following Jang Song-Thaek wants to overthrow Kim Jung Un. (((Message to Jang Song-Thaek's group: Take control of the country before it is too late!))) Nostradamus is giving me the hint here - Jang Song-Thaek (banished from the political party and then executed), I read through his biography. Who is next?  dead and scattered are the remaining clues. Kim Jong Il died of a heart attack? We could assume this to be the case. Kim Jong Il died in 2011. So, the (L) is Kim Jong Il as dead. The last one is telling me the fate of North Korea. OR it could simply be about just Kim Jung-Un? What could cause scattered??? Nuclear explosion? Nuclear explosion accident? (I hope this is the case rather than the people). He tries to escape in a submarine and it gets destroyed? Someone in the military decides to eliminate him with a tank? Or is it a freak accident of some sort like some of the individual Nostradamus mentioned the historical timeline? Well, two individuals are gone. Only (K) is left and this is Kim Jung Un! All praise Jang Song-Thaek !!! and his military group! King of Terror of 1999 is Igor Strelkov Girkin (C10:Q72), Mabus is Mohan Madhukar Bhagwat(C2:Q62), Stalin (C8:Q80), Oliver Cromwell (C8:Q76) and Richard Cromwell (C1:Q78).",0,0

I don't even think it's street legal, as it was when it set the time, here in america. It's now a purpose built TA livery. Good job goes to Richie for not having a subaru yard sale.

ZBo1S6YZXa0,Take a shot each time she says Morphe,3,0
ZBo1S6YZXa0,It really disturbs me to my core how arrogant you seem in videos. Like I wish you were more humble due to the fact that you wouldn't have your boujee ass house if it weren't for your subscribers and that it is so time consuming to decorate that we can't even get consistent videos? Most people who watch your videos make a living working actual jobs where they don't have the luxury of just being too busy in Fiji to do their job? Answering 12 emails and shopping at sephora doesn't seem that stressful to me.  Just a thought,15,5

ZBo1S6YZXa0,"Jaclyn sweety I love you , but I felt like I was watching the How to: Easy Smokey cat eye or your How to: Easy Glam look from a couple months ago. You created this unbelievably beautiful palette, where you can do so many looks and get crazy creative. You can easily step out of your comfort zone. I think many of us here are waiting for new makeup look using the shades such as Pool Party, Jada, Royalty, Twerk, Diva, Little Lady, Sissy etc. COME ON MAMAS !!! Give us the good stuff cause hun... ITS BEEN AWHILLLEEEEEEE 🙌🏼 I've seen all the repost you do on other youtubers creating looks using just your palette booboo!!! See if maybee that could help you get inspired, there's no shame in that AT ALL ! I can imagine that after a certain point and all these years it's easy to get stuck when it comes to new ideas.

She's been a little MIA but that's because she's got a whole other life to live & nobody realizes how draining it really is to be a YouTuber. \nIf you were really a fan you would understand that... and no I'm not kissing ass I'm just trying to get some of you to understand!,0,0

You couldn't break a record so you guys had to give it to Prodrive to get it where it needs to be.

I assume the goal was to break the record of a Sedan body car, at all costs. Hence the 600 ponies, nearly double that of a factory STi. I say job well done.

I don't even think it's street legal, as it was when it set the time, here in america. It's now a purpose built TA livery. Good job goes to Richie for not having a subaru yard sale. I guess I set my standards too high...not a lot of production vehicles can go from dealership lot, to Nordschleife TA, without modification, and set a decent lap time.",2,2

Weak-rodded FA20 that makes EJ207 power from the 90s....... How about you guys try and break records in a STOCK car......the Civic Type R set a record, IN STOCK FORM.

I really like your hosting style, it's like I'm hanging out with a friend who's telling me about the product - very accessible and informative.

lse3oJfPPk4,"I really wanted a Apple Watch so I preordered the 3 literally 30 minutes after they went live to preorder, I got mine with Verizon, I think I got a good deal mine was about $450 the others I think were sold out, the prices were ridiculous up to 600-1000 price range it was ridiculous. I think that was the Hermès edition though, anyhow I can’t wait to get mine, hopefully if I don’t like it they told me I can return it within 3 months so hopefully I do like it but I think this is an investment since I do exercise and I leave my phone in my car I can just listen to music via the watch with Bluetooth headphones by the way does anyone know where I can buy some AirPods I love Apple headphones I really want to AirPods or if you have a headphone that is comfortable to the ear that is Bluetooth compatible let me know. Also you can Apple Pay with the watch I do that with my phone at gas stations, or if I go to the store. I feel like it’s just a big money thing for them though so they can make more money with the service provider $10 for a smartwatch every month is kinda pricey I mean I probably won’t sit there and call with my watch but we’ll see.",0,0

Do you know how much testing they do?

La letra es una oda a la pereza, como antídoto contra los terribles acontecimientos de nuestro tiempo, mientras canta: StopWatching the news, because the news contrives to frighten you. El disco se pondrá a la venta el 17 de noviembre con el título “Low In High School” Es el primer material del artista en tres años, desde que en 2014 publicó su último trabajo, World Peace Is None of Your Business. Los doce temas que compondrán el disco han sido grabados en La Fabrique Studios en Saint-Rémy-de-Provence (Francia) y en Forum Studios, los estudios de Ennio Morricone en Roma.

ZBo1S6YZXa0,"Jaclyn, i have been a loyal and loving fan for a few years. I found you when i was pregnant with my now 2 year old. I spent my pregnancy on bed rest with her and stumbled upon your channel. You are just the most beautiful woman I've ever seen. And your personality is nothing short of the best. I now watch you with my 2 year old and when we watch you, she says, ohhhh, so peeeeeety  (pretty) mommy, peeeeety, while you blend your eyeshadow and do your face make up lol. I've loved EVERY single look you've done, but  honestly, i think this is my MOST favorite! I think it's because first and foremost, i LOVE your palette and i LOVE those warm toned colors, and because matte eyeshadow looks are my FAVORITE! I think i love it so much too because I am OBSESSED with bronzing AND contouring. I LOVE it when you do both. I don't like the just bronzing look. It adds so much beautiful dimension to the face when you do both. And finally, because you got me HOOKED on Lolita, and it still is my favorite lip color of ALL time! I pick up a tube every time I'm at Sephora because they are sold out often and I'm terrified of them running out or discontinuing it or something crazy like that.  Thank you for all your inspiration and making it seem like i am chit chatting and getting ready with a girlfriend. Love you so much girl and happy to hear you and your family are safe! Xoxo",0,0
ZBo1S6YZXa0,"Gotta say... Girl's got a bomb down to earth personality and such a genuine passion for what she does and for US as her subscribers. I think some people sometimes forget or take for granted all the hard work she has put into putting herself out there and giving her all in what she does. Keep on keeping on girl <3\\n\\nNever regret being a good person, to the wrong people. Your behavior says everything about you, and their behavior says enough about them",0,0

ZBo1S6YZXa0,"FINALLY a tutorial with your palette. Good thing no one held their breath. And amen to the people that did post videos on YOUR palette. You're definitely not the same YouTuber I started watching 5 years ago :/. There's definitely just as successful people here on the tube that still post at least once a week. You've been absent in the YouTube realm for about a year really. Your fans give you tons of ideas for videos and it's like you ignore it all and instead make up excuses. This is your job now, not a hobby I get it and see it. Please go back to some of your old ways.",0,0

ZBo1S6YZXa0,"I have been watching jaclyn's videos for the last 2 years and this is the first time i'm starting to take less interest in her channel. Her new palette looks great and it finally get released in the UK next week. But she's hardly posted videos using this palette, that's taken her years to make. There are colours in the palette (brights) that I never use and she's mentioned she'll do more tutorials. When? Because right now why should I part with my money? I fully understand we all have things going on in our lives. But just 1 tutorial a week using different looks since she first announced the palette would have been great, and without youtube and us, this palette would never have happened. So I don't think that would have been too much to ask.",0,0

I am so tired of those kind of looks! They're gorgeous but I know how talented you are and I know you can pull a lot more creativity from your mind!!! It might help you destress to be really investing in some looks you're not used to. I really miss your videos but I know you're very busy. I guess sometimes it just doesn't seem like you are interested in it anymore, and not inspired any more. I love you and your videos so much, you are in my top 3 favorites YouTubers/ Makeup Artists. Anyway, keep being you! You are beautiful and so strong. I hope you have more energy and creativity for newer looks and more videos! Love you 💖",0,0

Yes, she gets a good amount of her money because of us who watch her videos... BUT stop acting like she isnt a regular human being like the rest of us. LIFE happens.. sometimes you have to take time to yourself. She is a married women, dealing with different struggles .. just because LauraLee has time to make videos every day, doesnt mean Jaclyn does. They are TWO different people with TWO different lives.

I think it would get better after the software, but I also don't believed other smart watches are better than Apple Watch. I've own Samsung and other android smart watches and they really suck. They need way more improvement than apple.  So I don't really agree about your last part of your video.

Battery is life is superior without LTE.

I have no doubt Apple has worked some great engineering to get the ground plane folded somehow into the screen, I don't see how they can make it long enough for frequencies below 900Mhz to work well enough.

lse3oJfPPk4,"I really wanted a Apple Watch so I preordered the 3 literally 30 minutes after they went live to preorder, I got mine with Verizon, I think I got a good deal mine was about $450 the others I think were sold out, the prices were ridiculous up to 600-1000 price range it was ridiculous. I think that was the Hermès edition though, anyhow I can’t wait to get mine, hopefully if I don’t like it they told me I can return it within 3 months so hopefully I do like it but I think this is an investment since I do exercise and I leave my phone in my car I can just listen to music via the watch with Bluetooth headphones by the way does anyone know where I can buy some AirPods I love Apple headphones I really want to AirPods or if you have a headphone that is comfortable to the ear that is Bluetooth compatible let me know. Also you can Apple Pay with the watch I do that with my phone at gas stations, or if I go to the store. I feel like it’s just a big money thing for them though so they can make more money with the service provider $10 for a smartwatch every month is kinda pricey I mean I probably won’t sit there and call with my watch but we’ll see.",0,0
lse3oJfPPk4,"Don’t get Watch OS4 if you have the series 2 or less. It’s absolute garbage. You can’t control music anymore from your watch, and there still isn’t any sort of syncing for the messages.  The only thing somewhat useful is the flashlight, and that’s just meh.",0,0

lse3oJfPPk4,"I was talking to an ATT representative, they said you do not have to get another line in order for the LTE to work. It is supposed to piggy back off of your main phone line. Which might explain why apple didn't ask for any network info when I pre-ordered it. \\n\\nAlso,  maybe next time give the job of reviewing a brand new product to someone who is actually interested in reviewing it. And maybe to someone who understands how software works.\\n\\nRoad map wise bringing LTE to watches is a major step towards the next big change to the smart phone industry, turning smart phones into smart wearable phones.

Here it does feel like quite a sudden jump, maybe that's just the instrumental). \\n\\nI like that it's a catchy pop tune with some not-so-pop lyrics which has always been Moz's style. It's so darn catchy, he must have gotten a few music technicians who knew how to make an ear worm in the studio.\\n\\nInitially I found 'Time, do as I wish' to be a bit arrogant, but I suppose it's about his depression and he's able to control it by sleeping and actually finds strength in that 'pillows like pillars', but I do wish this was used better in another song or gone into more as an idea.\\n\\nSaying he slept while people were out working hard is still very rude sounding to me, Morrissey does realise his job is in the music industry, right? May not be conventional, but it is technically a job to keep the machine turning. I mean just think of all the CDs, T-shirts, etc he's selling and propping up the corporate giants.\\n\\nThere are some parts that feel like he just came up with on the spot, like I doubt the line 'No highway, freeway, motorway' took him very long at all. It's lazy.\\n\\nThe song could have been better, but considering I initially hated it and now don't mind nodding my head to it... That's a big improvement.

iL_-GwbEP4g,"Morrissey regresa con las pilas cargadas y con muy mala baba. La portada es ya una provocación, pero en el nuevo disco carga contra figuras políticas, cuestionando la autoridad y disparando contra las mentes bienpensantes. Algunos de los títulos del nuevo álbum nos dejan claras sus intenciones:\\nIsrael, Who Will Protect Us From the Police? y The Girl from Tel-Aviv Who Wouldn’t Kneel.\\nEl ex-vocalista de The Smiths ya publicó en 2013 una autobiografía incendiaria que resultó un éxito de ventas y 2014 reveló que se había sometido hasta en cuatro ocasiones a distintos tratamientos para luchar contra el cáncer.\\nEl artista británico estrena el primer single Spent the day in bed, un tema que nos recuerda al mejor Morrissey. La letra es una oda a la pereza, como antídoto contra los terribles acontecimientos de nuestro tiempo, mientras canta: StopWatching the news, because the news contrives to frighten you. El disco se pondrá a la venta el 17 de noviembre con el título “Low In High School” Es el primer material del artista en tres años, desde que en 2014 publicó su último trabajo, World Peace Is None of Your Business. Los doce temas que compondrán el disco han sido grabados en La Fabrique Studios en Saint-Rémy-de-Provence (Francia) y en Forum Studios, los estudios de Ennio Morricone en Roma. El undécimo disco de la carrera de Morrissey ha sido producido por Joe Chiccarelli, quien también ha colaborado con artistas como The Strokes, Beck y The White Stripes.\\nMúsica independiente novedades.",0,0

SHq2qrFUlGY,"shakira, love you so much. But, fue un video muy esperado y es de muy mala calidad...\\n\\nPienso que tienes que volver para aqui a los Estados Unidos para que vuelvas a tomar o retomar la calidad de sus videos. Barcelona no es un lugar para hacer musica...hacer musica es propio de Miami o NYC...Definitivamente tienes que volver para estas tierras donde te exigen demasiado por la calidad y por la gran competencia que hay en U.S. y cambia de director musical o de videos...\\nSabemos que tienes hijos y esposo, y que tu tiempo es mas limitado. Por eso debes entregarte con mas concentracion y calidad en tus proyectos. Te cuento que no puedes darte el lujo de la mediocridad porque hoy en dia te ve el planeta entero y debe haber concordancia con el contenido y con la imagen o video. Acuerdate de esto siempre: Una idea, una imagen, un sentimiento. \\nNo hagas las cosas por hacerlas sino por su vocacion natural musical....Tu album tienes unas canciones super bellas, realmente una obra musical como lo son: Amarillo, Nada, Toneladas, Deja Vu, Comme Moi, and when a woman. Pero sus videos deben estar a una altura universal....\\n\\nTu no tienes derecho a ser superficial o mediocre, Por que? porque el planeta entero espera mas de ti, y te exige mas, y tambien porque de ti dependen miles de niños por alimentar en paises en via de desarrollo.  Y el planeta entero espera un buen disco y un todo fabuloso para el Proximo Mundial....\\n\\nEscoge y trabaja con los mejores musicos o personas de la musica del mundo, tu te lo mereces....\\n\\nDeja a Pique con el balon y Tu a la musica, y asi cada uno a sus zapatos= Zapatero a tus zapatos....",0,0

6O7x7-srbHI,"I saw some of your old vlogs before and I enjoyed watching it. I'm sorry to hear about your condition but I know that you can do this!!! I'm in the healthcare profession and I can't help myself to share what I know about cancer and the acidity in the body. I want to recommend for you to read, Killing Cancer not People by Robert Wright, he is the founder of the American Anti-Cancer Institute based in Seattle. And you can also check out their website and look at their top ten list. The first one on the list is medical grade alkaline water. Maybe you should check it out, because we know people who has cancer who was helped by this water. The water helps by neutralizing the acidity in the body. Because when you have cancer, that means that the body is very acidic. Please don't drink soda, carbonated water or flavored water because those are very acidic, so its not good for you. And I'm sorry, I saw your coconut water, we tested that brand and that is also acidic. If you don't have a machine that makes the medical grade alkaline water, the best is to just drink purified tap water. If you have to do research on the water, go to PubMed.gov or google scholar and type in Electrolyzed reduced water (ERW) and it will show all the scientific researches done by other countries regarding this water. Robert Wright recommended a specific brand for the water and it is in his book. I hope you got something from my sharing and I will keep praying for your fast recovery.

6O7x7-srbHI,"http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/854566\\n\\nHi Wil! I am one of your active prayer warriors.\\nSometime in 2006-2007 a friend's sister had cancer. This friend, a german businessman, had heard about the cancer benefits of CORDYCEPS and requested my hubby to buy fresh Cordyceps from Binondo and had it sent to Germany in a refrigerated container (ice box). Before his sister had ingested Cordyceps she'd sleep for hours after her chemo session, totally weakened. When the package arrived the Cordyceps was mixed (a tiny slice will do) in her chicken soup. Immediately, a positive change in her was noted after chemo. Whereas before she'd be seen lying, now she was seen watering the plants in the garden and in a happy mood. Today she is alive and well. ☺\\nSo try mo 'to Wil. Kung nabibili yan sa Binondo, i'm sure meron din nyan dyan sa chinese stores. There are powdered varieties and even in pill form (i take the pill when i have cough for faster relief) but for chemo side effects, the fresh variety is more recommended.\\nGod bless you young man. Get well soonest. ❤",2,0

lse3oJfPPk4,Does it has finger print recognition? That would be a must have in the hardware! It probably will be in Apple watch 4 as a gimmick feature to sell and reason to upgrade!,0,0
lse3oJfPPk4,I was one of the first to get the series 3. Had to wake up at 2 a.m.,0,0
lse3oJfPPk4,And how do apple explain the connectivity on the beach? Did you had wifi?,0,0
lse3oJfPPk4,"you forgot to mention that the LTE version also has a ceramic back, whereas the note LTE version is a composite back (glass)... also the stainless steel and ceramic models are only LTE.\\n\\nAlso...the LTE watch does not work on all bands and in some countries, it is limited to LTE bands...it would be interesting to see if you got a cellphone signal out in the see on your surfboard - if you did, then you should on the watch...but if you dont, then this is nothing to do with the watch, but instead to do with the cellphone coverage in that area.\\n\\nI live in japan. I got the watch on launch day. it works out an extra $3 a month, and the first 6 months are free - but, in japan we only have LTE coverage for the watch. However, i was able to venture out without my wallet or phone - i just paid with apple pay and still felt connect to the world with messages etc.\\nMore or less, if your phone gets an LTE signal then your watch will too - if youre in a 3G area, then your watch wont work (apart from a few countries with the additional bands).\\nIf you only get 2G or no phone signal (such as out in the ocean) then your watch wont work.",0,0

lse3oJfPPk4,"Uh oh, this is the first time I’ve heard that LTE on the watch ups your bill by $10/mo. That’s a tough sell over the life of the watch, unless you’re a heavy user leaving the phone at home. Personally, I’ll keep my series 2 because why would I leave my phone at home? I walk 5 mi./day with the phone around my ankle and my Apple earbuds, and work the phone from my watch, perfect setup.",0,0

Battery is life is superior without LTE.

I have no doubt Apple has worked some great engineering to get the ground plane folded somehow into the screen, I don't see how they can make it long enough for frequencies below 900Mhz to work well enough.

Here it does feel like quite a sudden jump, maybe that's just the instrumental). \\n\\nI like that it's a catchy pop tune with some not-so-pop lyrics which has always been Moz's style. It's so darn catchy, he must have gotten a few music technicians who knew how to make an ear worm in the studio.\\n\\nInitially I found 'Time, do as I wish' to be a bit arrogant, but I suppose it's about his depression and he's able to control it by sleeping and actually finds strength in that 'pillows like pillars', but I do wish this was used better in another song or gone into more as an idea.\\n\\nSaying he slept while people were out working hard is still very rude sounding to me, Morrissey does realise his job is in the music industry, right? May not be conventional, but it is technically a job to keep the machine turning. I mean just think of all the CDs, T-shirts, etc he's selling and propping up the corporate giants.\\n\\nThere are some parts that feel like he just came up with on the spot, like I doubt the line 'No highway, freeway, motorway' took him very long at all. It's lazy.\\n\\nThe song could have been better, but considering I initially hated it and now don't mind nodding my head to it... That's a big improvement.

I'm glad that it makes them confident, because ulatamitly make-up can be fun and is totally a way to express yourself and boost ones confidence!

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"Do as The Walking Dead does... Make it close to the source material, but different enough so that those that know the story by heart still get something new out of it. Almost like a variation of sorts. Like you want the story to still be similar, but having surprises and even tangents that weren't explored within the source make it new and exciting for all.",0,0
IvFw9zhIYkQ,"I had the same reaction you did with the trailers. Looks good, but we'll see. I agree with the notion about Mortal Kombat being good for following the story. But the whole time my nerdy attention was wondering WHO was at your house playing your NES Classic and WHY choose Luigi for World 1-2! Oh, and WHY WASN'T IT ME?! lol",0,0
IvFw9zhIYkQ,"I love detailed stories in video games but I think movies have to be careful in bringing a video game to life. To me a video game that would make a good movie would have to met a few expectations. \\n\\n1. Gameplay is not essential to the story. In games where gameplay is essential to being a part of the story (strategy games, stealth games, puzzle games, skill games, etc) a movie would lost those elements making it fundamentally a bad representation of the game. Imagine a GTA movie, basically it would be the Fast and Furious the fun of killing people, stealing cars, and the absurdity of it all would be lost in a movie.\\n2. No multiple endings. By creating a movie based off game with multiple endings you are choosing an ending which then everybody who doesn't agree with that ending or would have done things differently now thinks the movie is wrong. If an ending is to be chosen let the game developers chose it when making a sequel. Imagine a Persona 5 movie, there are so many alternate endings that no fan would truly be satisfied.\\n3. No create your own character games. Games where a player has to chose a sex and race of the character would face similar problems to number two. No one would be satisfied. Not to mention that every group would get up in arms over whomever the director chose. Imagine a Fallout 4 movie, do you make the Sole Survivor a white male, a white female, a black male, black female, etc? No option is a good bet to avoid public backlash.\\n4. No super strict lore. Though stories with lose in game lore would face difficulties making a movie based off a game that has strict lore would probably make people even madder. One thing wrong or changed and that's all anyone focuses on. We see plenty of examples like recently the Assassin's Creed movie.\\n\\nTo me the best way to make a movie from a video game is to never follow the main story line of any game but make it lore accurate. I think Warcraft had the right idea and would have been a great movie if they had gotten the lore right. It is telling a story that players have never seen before but have heard about, meaning we can't really compare it to the game. The downfall was the lore errors. Make a movie within a video game world but not of a video game - for example - Batman: Assault on Arkham; technically takes place within the Batman Arkham universe but doesn't copy a game, because those stories have been told already. If you want a live action movie do a game within the Fallout universe but instead of Fallout 4 show us what is happening in Houston, TX or Chicago, IL; or show us the Conquering of Tameriel by Thanos. Just make sure these movies are lore accurate.",0,0

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"I would rather have video game movies based on video games with little to no story, that way you can see if movie writers still have an active imagination instead of them just copying and pasting most of the elements from the game's story into a movie for the quick cash-in. It takes more brain thinkin and creative imagination to make a movie based on Bubble Bobble than it does Tomb Raider.",0,0

I'm excited since even though it doesn't follow the plot of TR 2013, it instead seems to take elements and ideas from the games to tell their own story. To me, all that matters is if they can pull off an entertaining adventure that captures the heart of the entire TR franchise.",0,0

And they needs to call back some imagery and tropes of the game to add the spice of having fans notice those call-backs.  After that they story can be whatever they want. \\n\\nSadly, It sure seems like THIS TR movie is trying to recreate that rebooted  game story, and that could be an issue...since that story had issues and fans have seen it.\\n\\nThe second problem this movie will face is; well who remember this movie, ...A sixteen-year-old girl who was raised by her father to be the perfect assassin is dispatched on a mission across Europe  Sure, Lara didn't start out as an assassin but that is what she becomes in the first 15 minutes of the game.

Nice references to the games with a similar score and remixes as well as many mythology gags placed in there but still be in more of a side-series, that way it gets treated as it's own thing.",0,0
IvFw9zhIYkQ,"IMO, you shouldn't recreate a story that gamers already have experienced on an interactive level and now you're asking them to just sit and watch an abbreviated version of that? Keep the key, core elements that makes a franchise appealing in the first place and leave the rest up to a good script writer and director to make it a fun movie. Let video games be video games and let movies be movies. With Tomb Raider, there's not a lot you need to ask from them. Give Lara charisma, dual pistols and a globe trotting adventure w/ tombs and such. That should be easy for Hollywood to make a fun movie with. If you can't massage a video game property or it's story into a decent movie format, then maybe it should never have been a movie in the first place?",0,0
IvFw9zhIYkQ,"Final Fantasy Advent Children is probably the best way to handle video game movies. High quality sequels or prequels that add to the world without being a copy and paste of the game.

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"I think if video game movies are going to truly work, they need to be ADDITIONS to the story. Something Cannon that contributes to the story as a whole. It's been attempted but not enough people are trying to perfect it. A perfect example would be Halo. There is a huge diverse universe to draw from since I feel you shouldn't use the already acted characters. A movie from the HALO Series would have to be something within the universe but not covered in the video games ie the Cole protocol. I know they've already made two movies but they were side-projects by the same production company meant to be used for marketing reasons not something full fledged. We just need people to actually attempt it and for directors to get out of there own way and make the movie proper without retconning everything.",0,0

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"Would it help if they did something ala Spider-Man: Homecoming or Deadpool? In that it doesn't need to talk about any origin stories, or at least swiftly allude or tell it in flashbacks, and the rest is its own story? I imagine that, in a time where video games are almost movies with interraction, a movie doesn't have to be of that game, but another time in the same universe. That was what I thought the Assassin's Creed movie was; it took place in the same universe as the games, but changed the cast and time period because that was anyway something the games would do.\\n\\nSo the Tomb Raider movie could tell a story about this remade Lara Croft's story, but have her suffer PTSD flashbacks from her origin story game as she does stuff. I think (THINK) that one thing the first game was criticized for was that it didn't really have a lot of tomb raiding, so with that out of the way, the movie could focus on actual archeology and such.\\n\\nI agree with you that one should be able to just think it doesn't look bad, but I'm not that excited either.

IvFw9zhIYkQ,My biggest problem with video game movies nowadays is that they're just telling the same story as the video game. And they aren't doing it as well as the video game. The major problem is a lack of creativity. When you look at a good comic book movie you see someone telling a similar feeling story but with new creative content like what's a lot of what Marvel does. Civil War has a similar feel to the comic book but it's telling its own story. And that's what video game movies need to do. It's all about studying and understanding the content that you're creating the movie from.,0,0

When you have games like the old Tomb Raider titles that had an epic musical score, and then you make a movie this uses bad techno music and sets that look more like bad theme park attactions than actual places, you cheapen the experience (i.e. the first Angelina Jolie Tomb Raider movie).",0,0

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"You hit the nail on the head with regards to movies based on video games from past and present.  Even though I personally liked those movies you mentioned by name the games by far were better; it would be nice if the translations got major improvements.  Like books you worry translating a condensed version of a story with added bonus of not being interactive, also most producers of movies, video games and music don't necessarily care about content so much as money brought by products.  We still get bad interpretations of comic books, books and even other movies based on a previous movie (which is one you would think they would get right).",0,0
IvFw9zhIYkQ,"As a non-console gamer who saw the Jolie Tomb Raider films and never played the old games, I think your response to the trailer is very telling: It's possible that the games are actually the bigger medium here, and the movie's purpose is just as much to drive the game franchise forward as to emulate its mojo - to be a two-hour ad for the Tomb Raider games the way the old Transformers were a series of half-hour ads for toys.",2,0

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"I would like to see a good Video Game movie but I just feel like there's alot of people in hollywood that just don't care and they try and make any kind of profit off of a well known Video game. Think of it like with Activision as of lately they don't seem to care about their fans or gamers because they just throw in micro transactions on their games to make more money even where it's not needed like Call of Duty and Destiny.. get rid of the micro transactions and listen to the fans and you'll still make more money. But instead they just listen to greed and force people to spend hundreds of dollars to try and gamble for the items in game they want.. like a cool camo or emote and it just pisses me off that people can get so greedy and careless. But there are some games that have a chance to make a good Video Game movie like The Last of Us, Bioshock, Gears of War, Horizion Zero Dawn, and a couple others",0,0
IvFw9zhIYkQ,"I don't think the problem with Assassins Creed was that it was different from the games. In fact I thought introducing new characters was a genius move on their part.

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"I think movies based off video games should focus on expanding the mythology of that video game franchise. Or use the games environment and setting as a back drop to tell stories that would be to  short or boring as a video. Like people want a Grand Theft Auto movie, how about just make a movie about Niko Bellic and how his time in the war changed him or his European crime life that caused him to flee to America in the first place. Use them to give certain characters more screen time that the game didn't. Going back to assassins creed, I love Connor from AC3 and me and people who don't like him would agree that if he had a sequel to explore more of his character that would've been a great idea; so why give him a movie about him dealing with the events of the previous games.

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"Good topic. I think a good way for a film adaptation of video games is to make them their own unique story while keeping it canon to the source material. It could be a progressing story that's either a sequel or prequel. That way, when a later installment of the game is released, one player would question what happened previously, and another player would say Oh, you'd have to watch the movie to find out what happened. I think that idea would drive interest to see the movie and play the games.",0,0
IvFw9zhIYkQ,"Extra Credits has a great ep discussing some of the reasons I think making a good adaption is difficult (linked here) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnP2boSC-FM  Moreover though, games have gotten to the point where story rules in certain game genres but has yet to get to the depths that a film could reach. This might have something to do with the very nature of games where you interact within a game with agency which is not something you can do with a film. It's definitely a cash grab by studios though, because the game industry is so lucrative, because everyone is grabbing for an MCU style system and because making film is expensive and there is a need to look for a good return on investment with much of what is made today. The film industry is weird that way...because as much as I think film can be art, it is also inextricably tied to business and profit. Games are in some ways an outgrowth of that same idea, just much earlier along in the process. I just want more original stuff out there, I will just go play the game if I want that first original experience, there's no need to create a film experience as well unless you're going to bring something new or expansive to what I'm watching. Nice little talk though, I'd love to see more!",0,0

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"I still consider Run Lola Run to be one of the greatest video game movies ever... and it isn't even based on a game! But it's a film where the main character is able to Save and Reload. \\n\\nBasically, she's trying to stop her boyfriend from committing a robbery, and every time she dies or makes a mistake, she Reloads to a previous point in time.",1,2
IvFw9zhIYkQ,"This is the biggest problem with game-based films. What makes a game great is not necessarily translatable to the silver screen. Tetris is one of the most popular games ever, but I doubt you could make a movie out of stacking boxes. Likewise, 120 minutes of a fat Italian man jumping on turtles would probably not break the box office.\\n\\nThe reason is (partly) this: In a game you react to the action because you are actually performing it. It doesn't matter if you are Crash Bandicoot, Lara Croft or Heihachi Mishima. There doesn't need to be a story line. Most classic games just had one screen of text explaining the backstory, which was essentially unnecessary to the enjoyment of the game. The princess has been kidnapped. Somebody set us up the bomb!\\nIn a film, the writer, director and actor all need to work together to make us understand the character and empathize with him/her/it. If they don't, we have no connection to the character - and therefore to the action - and we're just watching a two hour long parkour video.\\n\\nGame franchises that have more of a story line are (for the reasons listed above) almost universally awful as movies, and only appeal to fans of the games. The true test is to show the movie to an audience who has never heard of the game franchise and see if they like it. We who are fans of a franchise are often blind to the shortcomings of these films, we remember our feelings from playing the game, and transpose them onto the film.\\n\\nThe only way to make it work IMO is to give the backstory, setting and characters to real screen writers and have them write a script that isn't a recreation of the game. Get a real director and make him direct the movie based on this script, not the game. It looks like this is what they did here.",2,1

Cinderella's fairy godmother, which as previously mentioned, also has Cruella's voice in it which links to the Little Mermaid.\\n\\nSo Ursula is linked to Cruella who is linked to the Stepmother who is linked to the Queen of Hearts.

It's only informative and teaching people how to fix their own phones I mean it's not lie they could be losing money on ripping people or carriers off right!!?? Lol!!

The start screen of Origins also has an awesome elf language song in the opening screen, if you could find the words to it.  I used to leave the splash screen up until that song stopped playing, just to listen to it, then listened to it in the start screen when the game opened.  Your version would probably be even better.  There's also Leliana's Song in Origins, and it's also in the made-up elf language.  I prefer the start screen song if I had to pick, but many would prefer Leliana's Song.\\n\\nPlus Dragon Age: Inquisition is full of bard songs, if one took an interest in them.

6O7x7-srbHI,"Chemotherapy should already be illegal, but it’s not. Many Americans don’t even know that the success rate of chemo is only 2.3% and failing to overcome cancer sits at 97.7% on average. 75% of oncologists and also general doctors wouldn’t recommend chemotherapy to a family member, and they wouldn’t do it themselves either. So it leaves us wondering why others need to go through chemo if doctors wouldn’t go near it.\\n\\nWhat happens with chemo is that it turns the body more acid and because of that, more cancer cells can thrive. It could kill the ones the patients already have, but it sets the right environment for other cancer cells to multiply.\\n\\nChemotherapy kills good gut bacteria and lowers human immunity. Doing so, the person loses their ability to fight cancer and even other diseases. A good analogy to explain how chemotherapy works is to imagine that you are in a swimming pool, and someone dumps a ton of toxic pesticide next to you just to kill a few bugs in the water.",1,0

I'm in the healthcare profession and I can't help myself to share what I know about cancer and the acidity in the body. I want to recommend for you to read, Killing Cancer not People by Robert Wright, he is the founder of the American Anti-Cancer Institute based in Seattle. And you can also check out their website and look at their top ten list. The first one on the list is medical grade alkaline water. Maybe you should check it out, because we know people who has cancer who was helped by this water. The water helps by neutralizing the acidity in the body. Because when you have cancer, that means that the body is very acidic. Please don't drink soda, carbonated water or flavored water because those are very acidic, so its not good for you. And I'm sorry, I saw your coconut water, we tested that brand and that is also acidic. If you don't have a machine that makes the medical grade alkaline water, the best is to just drink purified tap water. If you have to do research on the water, go to PubMed.gov or google scholar and type in Electrolyzed reduced water (ERW) and it will show all the scientific researches done by other countries regarding this water. Robert Wright recommended a specific brand for the water and it is in his book. I hope you got something from my sharing and I will keep praying for your fast recovery.

I got the watch on launch day. it works out an extra $3 a month, and the first 6 months are free - but, in japan we only have LTE coverage for the watch. However, i was able to venture out without my wallet or phone - i just paid with apple pay and still felt connect to the world with messages etc.\\nMore or less, if your phone gets an LTE signal then your watch will too - if youre in a 3G area, then your watch wont work (apart from a few countries with the additional bands).\\nIf you only get 2G or no phone signal (such as out in the ocean) then your watch wont work.",0,0

Battery is life is superior without LTE.

I have no doubt Apple has worked some great engineering to get the ground plane folded somehow into the screen, I don't see how they can make it long enough for frequencies below 900Mhz to work well enough. That's why most other LTE watches have used the wrist band as part of the ground plane.",0,0

Q3Rq-irFn1w,"In The Little Mermaid, Prince Eric's caretaker, Grimsby, is voiced by Ben Wright, who was also the voice of Roger from 101 Dalmatians.

Cinderella's stepmother is voiced by Eleanor Audley, who also did Maleficent in Sleeping Beauty. One of Aurora's fairy godmothers, Flora, is also the Queen of Hearts, AND Verna Felton (Flora, Queen of Hearts) was also... Cinderella's fairy godmother, which as previously mentioned, also has Cruella's voice in it which links to the Little Mermaid.\\n\\nSo Ursula is linked to Cruella who is linked to the Stepmother who is linked to the Queen of Hearts. Also, there was an actor in Sleeping Beauty as one of Maleficent's goons who was in Snow White as Sleepy and Grumpy, successfully linking the Evil Queen with both Lady Tremaine (the evil Stepmother) and the Queen of Hearts.\\n\\nAll five of them can be linked very easily.",0,0

IvFw9zhIYkQ,I think it's awk since I wouldn't see a video game movie unless I played the game and to get mass appeal I'd think the movie would have to stray away from whatever lore was built into the game so I think it leaves you in a pickle either go for mass appeal (like you should since that's the goal) or go for the players. If you go mass appeal and everyone talks about it being based on a game average people will be like I haven't played that game why would I see it (barring any amazing trailer) Then if you go for the gamers who played the game which narrows your audience and then out of that pool they have to want to actually go see it when it may simply be a retread of the game they love just a little fancier. So it seems like a lose lose to me unless it's with a game property that is universally known like Mario or Zelda but even then you need all your ducks in a row otherwise you'll wind up with more failed attempts so it's hard and I don't know if we'll get there but hopefully.,0,0

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"I think an adaptation of a video game only makes sense when the movie can bring something to the game either action-wise or story-wise. If for example, you can make action scenes better, because you are not hindered by the game mechanics, that works. And if you can make a better story because the story of the game was flawed, that also can work.\\n\\nI can't really see how a Tomb Raider movie can improve story or action of the game as both were pretty good, making a movie kind of unnecessary.

Video games are a interactive entertainment experience, I can't lump or compare the two because in my eyes they are not really related. Games require much more work, and the reason you come back to them can vary. Example: If you play games like Zelda or Prof. Layton because you enjoy puzzles, a movie adaptation may not feel right to you no matter what the plot is, because you’re given nothing to solve on your own.",0,0
IvFw9zhIYkQ,"Do as The Walking Dead does... Make it close to the source material, but different enough so that those that know the story by heart still get something new out of it.

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"I had the same reaction you did with the trailers. Looks good, but we'll see. I agree with the notion about Mortal Kombat being good for following the story. But the whole time my nerdy attention was wondering WHO was at your house playing your NES Classic and WHY choose Luigi for World 1-2! Oh, and WHY WASN'T IT ME?! lol",0,0
IvFw9zhIYkQ,"I love detailed stories in video games but I think movies have to be careful in bringing a video game to life. To me a video game that would make a good movie would have to met a few expectations. \\n\\n1. Gameplay is not essential to the story. In games where gameplay is essential to being a part of the story (strategy games, stealth games, puzzle games, skill games, etc) a movie would lost those elements making it fundamentally a bad representation of the game. Imagine a GTA movie, basically it would be the Fast and Furious the fun of killing people, stealing cars, and the absurdity of it all would be lost in a movie.\\n2. No multiple endings. By creating a movie based off game with multiple endings you are choosing an ending which then everybody who doesn't agree with that ending or would have done things differently now thinks the movie is wrong. If an ending is to be chosen let the game developers chose it when making a sequel. Imagine a Persona 5 movie, there are so many alternate endings that no fan would truly be satisfied.\\n3. No create your own character games. Games where a player has to chose a sex and race of the character would face similar problems to number two. No one would be satisfied. Not to mention that every group would get up in arms over whomever the director chose. Imagine a Fallout 4 movie, do you make the Sole Survivor a white male, a white female, a black male, black female, etc? No option is a good bet to avoid public backlash.\\n4. No super strict lore. Though stories with lose in game lore would face difficulties making a movie based off a game that has strict lore would probably make people even madder. One thing wrong or changed and that's all anyone focuses on. We see plenty of examples like recently the Assassin's Creed movie.\\n\\nTo me the best way to make a movie from a video game is to never follow the main story line of any game but make it lore accurate. I think Warcraft had the right idea and would have been a great movie if they had gotten the lore right. It is telling a story that players have never seen before but have heard about, meaning we can't really compare it to the game. The downfall was the lore errors. Make a movie within a video game world but not of a video game - for example - Batman: Assault on Arkham; technically takes place within the Batman Arkham universe but doesn't copy a game, because those stories have been told already. If you want a live action movie do a game within the Fallout universe but instead of Fallout 4 show us what is happening in Houston, TX or Chicago, IL; or show us the Conquering of Tameriel by Thanos. Just make sure these movies are lore accurate.",0,0

After that they story can be whatever they want. \\n\\nSadly, It sure seems like THIS TR movie is trying to recreate that rebooted  game story, and that could be an issue...since that story had issues and fans have seen it.\\n\\nThe second problem this movie will face is; well who remember this movie, ...A sixteen-year-old girl who was raised by her father to be the perfect assassin is dispatched on a mission across Europe  Sure, Lara didn't start out as an assassin but that is what she becomes in the first 15 minutes of the game.

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"IMO, you shouldn't recreate a story that gamers already have experienced on an interactive level and now you're asking them to just sit and watch an abbreviated version of that? Keep the key, core elements that makes a franchise appealing in the first place and leave the rest up to a good script writer and director to make it a fun movie. Let video games be video games and let movies be movies. With Tomb Raider, there's not a lot you need to ask from them. Give Lara charisma, dual pistols and a globe trotting adventure w/ tombs and such. That should be easy for Hollywood to make a fun movie with. If you can't massage a video game property or it's story into a decent movie format, then maybe it should never have been a movie in the first place?",0,0

But instead they just listen to greed and force people to spend hundreds of dollars to try and gamble for the items in game they want.. like a cool camo or emote and it just pisses me off that people can get so greedy and careless. But there are some games that have a chance to make a good Video Game movie like The Last of Us, Bioshock, Gears of War, Horizion Zero Dawn, and a couple others",0,0

Even though I personally liked those movies you mentioned by name the games by far were better; it would be nice if the translations got major improvements.  Like books you worry translating a condensed version of a story with added bonus of not being interactive, also most producers of movies, video games and music don't necessarily care about content so much as money brought by products.  We still get bad interpretations of comic books, books and even other movies based on a previous movie (which is one you would think they would get right).",0,0

It's been attempted but not enough people are trying to perfect it. A perfect example would be Halo. There is a huge diverse universe to draw from since I feel you shouldn't use the already acted characters. A movie from the HALO Series would have to be something within the universe but not covered in the video games ie the Cole protocol. I know they've already made two movies but they were side-projects by the same production company meant to be used for marketing reasons not something full fledged. We just need people to actually attempt it and for directors to get out of there own way and make the movie proper without retconning everything.",0,0

Like people want a Grand Theft Auto movie, how about just make a movie about Niko Bellic and how his time in the war changed him or his European crime life that caused him to flee to America in the first place. Use them to give certain characters more screen time that the game didn't. Going back to assassins creed, I love Connor from AC3 and me and people who don't like him would agree that if he had a sequel to explore more of his character that would've been a great idea; so why give him a movie about him dealing with the events of the previous games.

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"Good topic. I think a good way for a film adaptation of video games is to make them their own unique story while keeping it canon to the source material. It could be a progressing story that's either a sequel or prequel. That way, when a later installment of the game is released, one player would question what happened previously, and another player would say Oh, you'd have to watch the movie to find out what happened. I think that idea would drive interest to see the movie and play the games.",0,0
IvFw9zhIYkQ,"Extra Credits has a great ep discussing some of the reasons I think making a good adaption is difficult (linked here) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnP2boSC-FM  Moreover though, games have gotten to the point where story rules in certain game genres but has yet to get to the depths that a film could reach. This might have something to do with the very nature of games where you interact within a game with agency which is not something you can do with a film. It's definitely a cash grab by studios though, because the game industry is so lucrative, because everyone is grabbing for an MCU style system and because making film is expensive and there is a need to look for a good return on investment with much of what is made today. The film industry is weird that way...because as much as I think film can be art, it is also inextricably tied to business and profit. Games are in some ways an outgrowth of that same idea, just much earlier along in the process. I just want more original stuff out there, I will just go play the game if I want that first original experience, there's no need to create a film experience as well unless you're going to bring something new or expansive to what I'm watching.

But it's a film where the main character is able to Save and Reload. \\n\\nBasically, she's trying to stop her boyfriend from committing a robbery, and every time she dies or makes a mistake, she Reloads to a previous point in time.",1,2
IvFw9zhIYkQ,"This is the biggest problem with game-based films. What makes a game great is not necessarily translatable to the silver screen. Tetris is one of the most popular games ever, but I doubt you could make a movie out of stacking boxes. Likewise, 120 minutes of a fat Italian man jumping on turtles would probably not break the box office.\\n\\nThe reason is (partly) this: In a game you react to the action because you are actually performing it. It doesn't matter if you are Crash Bandicoot, Lara Croft or Heihachi Mishima. There doesn't need to be a story line. Most classic games just had one screen of text explaining the backstory, which was essentially unnecessary to the enjoyment of the game. The princess has been kidnapped. Somebody set us up the bomb!\\nIn a film, the writer, director and actor all need to work together to make us understand the character and empathize with him/her/it. If they don't, we have no connection to the character - and therefore to the action - and we're just watching a two hour long parkour video.\\n\\nGame franchises that have more of a story line are (for the reasons listed above) almost universally awful as movies, and only appeal to fans of the games. The true test is to show the movie to an audience who has never heard of the game franchise and see if they like it. We who are fans of a franchise are often blind to the shortcomings of these films, we remember our feelings from playing the game, and transpose them onto the film.\\n\\nThe only way to make it work IMO is to give the backstory, setting and characters to real screen writers and have them write a script that isn't a recreation of the game. Get a real director and make him direct the movie based on this script, not the game. It looks like this is what they did here.",2,1

The start screen of Origins also has an awesome elf language song in the opening screen, if you could find the words to it.  I used to leave the splash screen up until that song stopped playing, just to listen to it, then listened to it in the start screen when the game opened.  Your version would probably be even better.  There's also Leliana's Song in Origins, and it's also in the made-up elf language.  I prefer the start screen song if I had to pick, but many would prefer Leliana's Song.\\n\\nPlus Dragon Age: Inquisition is full of bard songs, if one took an interest in them.

6O7x7-srbHI,"Chemotherapy should already be illegal, but it’s not. Many Americans don’t even know that the success rate of chemo is only 2.3% and failing to overcome cancer sits at 97.7% on average. 75% of oncologists and also general doctors wouldn’t recommend chemotherapy to a family member, and they wouldn’t do it themselves either. So it leaves us wondering why others need to go through chemo if doctors wouldn’t go near it.\\n\\nWhat happens with chemo is that it turns the body more acid and because of that, more cancer cells can thrive. It could kill the ones the patients already have, but it sets the right environment for other cancer cells to multiply.\\n\\nChemotherapy kills good gut bacteria and lowers human immunity. Doing so, the person loses their ability to fight cancer and even other diseases. A good analogy to explain how chemotherapy works is to imagine that you are in a swimming pool, and someone dumps a ton of toxic pesticide next to you just to kill a few bugs in the water.",1,0

L3O6LocRoTo,"When Disney bought Star Wars, I knew the brand would never be the same again. Sure we can make some great arguments for why the prequels didn't deserve to exist, but at least Lucas was trying to do somethings different with those. Disney Star Wars is just so damn derivative of what has already come, I just can't immerse myself as much anymore. \\n\\nAnd while I did like Rogue One and thought it was a well made film, seeing it one time was enough. All of these Disney films feel like novelty films, not anything really moving the narrative along. I think the next Star Wars film is going to have to really take some long strides in building a new story arc, otherwise, it's just the same recycled stuff over and over again.",1,2
L3O6LocRoTo,"I have to wonder how relevant Watchmen actually is to an entire generation who have no idea what it's like to turn on the news not knowing if you might see an announcement that world war 3 was about to start.  It's now almost a historical document about living in the cold war, framed as a superhero movie, or series.",2,3
L3O6LocRoTo,"*warning: overanalzying* *pretty good overanalyzing though* So there's a specific cultural reason that aunt has to be a part of dirty aunt Roth, because the joke is meant to poke fun at Roth being vaguely dirty (initially that's what it was), and there's only a few contexts for one adult to call another adult out for being dirty... if one of them is a huge Puritan, or if there's some sort of additional context that makes it not appropriate, specifically the context of a young kid being around. To a child, or at least a teen, Roth would be aunt Roth. She's not the other SJ guys' aunt in that context, she's aunt Roth in the way that adults come to refer to each other by their relations, and the guys would be uncle this or that.  This context is also in part a result of their awareness of a younger skewing audience, so Roth may also be seen as the viewer's aunt. Annnnyway...",1,1

I’m still on the 1st ever gen that came out in 2015 and nothing much has changed except for under the hood upgrades and LTE which let’s face it, not many of us see a need for at this point. Plus, that ugly red dot on the digital crown. Wtf was Apple thinking with that? I thought they used to be one of the leaders in producing revolutionary designs but adding an unnecessary red dot just to differentiate it from its predecessors shows how little they went into improving on its design. Hopefully the series 4 would give me more reason to upgrade.",0,0

I got the watch on launch day. it works out an extra $3 a month, and the first 6 months are free - but, in japan we only have LTE coverage for the watch. However, i was able to venture out without my wallet or phone - i just paid with apple pay and still felt connect to the world with messages etc.\\nMore or less, if your phone gets an LTE signal then your watch will too - if youre in a 3G area, then your watch wont work (apart from a few countries with the additional bands).\\nIf you only get 2G or no phone signal (such as out in the ocean) then your watch wont work.",0,0

Q3Rq-irFn1w,"Loved this video! Those lipsticks are gorgeous!! As for the last two, it might be because of the lighting, but I though they were quite different. One was more of a brick-ish/ox blood kind of shade, where as the other was closer to an ox blood/plum. When I saw the swatches, the first thing that came in to my mind was this; why not use the darker plum-ish one to line the outside and part of the inner lip, and then use the other to finish off the middle part of the lip? Like a fade? I don't know the technical lingo lol but I hope you know what I mean.  I've seen pictures of people that would do it red and black lipstick. Either way, those colours are gorgeous and they look amazing on you! Love your show. Love your personality. Love your heart. Love you! You rock!

Q3Rq-irFn1w,Can you plz do a Halloween video bunny I love those like if you want her to do the video,1,0
IvFw9zhIYkQ,I think it's awk since I wouldn't see a video game movie unless I played the game and to get mass appeal I'd think the movie would have to stray away from whatever lore was built into the game so I think it leaves you in a pickle either go for mass appeal (like you should since that's the goal) or go for the players. If you go mass appeal and everyone talks about it being based on a game average people will be like I haven't played that game why would I see it (barring any amazing trailer) Then if you go for the gamers who played the game which narrows your audience and then out of that pool they have to want to actually go see it when it may simply be a retread of the game they love just a little fancier. So it seems like a lose lose to me unless it's with a game property that is universally known like Mario or Zelda but even then you need all your ducks in a row otherwise you'll wind up with more failed attempts so it's hard and I don't know if we'll get there but hopefully.,0,0

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"I think an adaptation of a video game only makes sense when the movie can bring something to the game either action-wise or story-wise.

And if you can make a better story because the story of the game was flawed, that also can work.\\n\\nI can't really see how a Tomb Raider movie can improve story or action of the game as both were pretty good, making a movie kind of unnecessary.

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"I love detailed stories in video games but I think movies have to be careful in bringing a video game to life. To me a video game that would make a good movie would have to met a few expectations. \\n\\n1. Gameplay is not essential to the story. In games where gameplay is essential to being a part of the story (strategy games, stealth games, puzzle games, skill games, etc) a movie would lost those elements making it fundamentally a bad representation of the game. Imagine a GTA movie, basically it would be the Fast and Furious the fun of killing people, stealing cars, and the absurdity of it all would be lost in a movie.\\n2. No multiple endings. By creating a movie based off game with multiple endings you are choosing an ending which then everybody who doesn't agree with that ending or would have done things differently now thinks the movie is wrong. If an ending is to be chosen let the game developers chose it when making a sequel. Imagine a Persona 5 movie, there are so many alternate endings that no fan would truly be satisfied.\\n3. No create your own character games. Games where a player has to chose a sex and race of the character would face similar problems to number two. No one would be satisfied. Not to mention that every group would get up in arms over whomever the director chose. Imagine a Fallout 4 movie, do you make the Sole Survivor a white male, a white female, a black male, black female, etc? No option is a good bet to avoid public backlash.\\n4. No super strict lore. Though stories with lose in game lore would face difficulties making a movie based off a game that has strict lore would probably make people even madder. One thing wrong or changed and that's all anyone focuses on. We see plenty of examples like recently the Assassin's Creed movie.\\n\\nTo me the best way to make a movie from a video game is to never follow the main story line of any game but make it lore accurate. I think Warcraft had the right idea and would have been a great movie if they had gotten the lore right. It is telling a story that players have never seen before but have heard about, meaning we can't really compare it to the game. The downfall was the lore errors. Make a movie within a video game world but not of a video game - for example - Batman: Assault on Arkham; technically takes place within the Batman Arkham universe but doesn't copy a game, because those stories have been told already. If you want a live action movie do a game within the Fallout universe but instead of Fallout 4 show us what is happening in Houston, TX or Chicago, IL; or show us the Conquering of Tameriel by Thanos. Just make sure these movies are lore accurate.",0,0

Let video games be video games and let movies be movies. With Tomb Raider, there's not a lot you need to ask from them. Give Lara charisma, dual pistols and a globe trotting adventure w/ tombs and such. That should be easy for Hollywood to make a fun movie with.

Games require much more work, and the reason you come back to them can vary.

But instead they just listen to greed and force people to spend hundreds of dollars to try and gamble for the items in game they want.. like a cool camo or emote and it just pisses me off that people can get so greedy and careless.

Like people want a Grand Theft Auto movie, how about just make a movie about Niko Bellic and how his time in the war changed him or his European crime life that caused him to flee to America in the first place. Use them to give certain characters more screen time that the game didn't. Going back to assassins creed, I love Connor from AC3 and me and people who don't like him would agree that if he had a sequel to explore more of his character that would've been a great idea; so why give him a movie about him dealing with the events of the previous games.

It could be a progressing story that's either a sequel or prequel.

I think that idea would drive interest to see the movie and play the games.",0,0
IvFw9zhIYkQ,"Extra Credits has a great ep discussing some of the reasons I think making a good adaption is difficult (linked here) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnP2boSC-FM  Moreover though, games have gotten to the point where story rules in certain game genres but has yet to get to the depths that a film could reach. This might have something to do with the very nature of games where you interact within a game with agency which is not something you can do with a film. It's definitely a cash grab by studios though, because the game industry is so lucrative, because everyone is grabbing for an MCU style system and because making film is expensive and there is a need to look for a good return on investment with much of what is made today. The film industry is weird that way...because as much as I think film can be art, it is also inextricably tied to business and profit. Games are in some ways an outgrowth of that same idea, just much earlier along in the process. I just want more original stuff out there, I will just go play the game if I want that first original experience, there's no need to create a film experience as well unless you're going to bring something new or expansive to what I'm watching.

Assassin's Creed biggest problem was there 3 great ideas in there that could of been there own individual movies.

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"This is the biggest problem with game-based films. What makes a game great is not necessarily translatable to the silver screen. Tetris is one of the most popular games ever, but I doubt you could make a movie out of stacking boxes. Likewise, 120 minutes of a fat Italian man jumping on turtles would probably not break the box office.\\n\\nThe reason is (partly) this: In a game you react to the action because you are actually performing it. It doesn't matter if you are Crash Bandicoot, Lara Croft or Heihachi Mishima. There doesn't need to be a story line. Most classic games just had one screen of text explaining the backstory, which was essentially unnecessary to the enjoyment of the game. The princess has been kidnapped. Somebody set us up the bomb!\\nIn a film, the writer, director and actor all need to work together to make us understand the character and empathize with him/her/it. If they don't, we have no connection to the character - and therefore to the action - and we're just watching a two hour long parkour video.\\n\\nGame franchises that have more of a story line are (for the reasons listed above) almost universally awful as movies, and only appeal to fans of the games. The true test is to show the movie to an audience who has never heard of the game franchise and see if they like it. We who are fans of a franchise are often blind to the shortcomings of these films, we remember our feelings from playing the game, and transpose them onto the film.\\n\\nThe only way to make it work IMO is to give the backstory, setting and characters to real screen writers and have them write a script that isn't a recreation of the game. Get a real director and make him direct the movie based on this script, not the game. It looks like this is what they did here.",2,1

lLAmL6Tz59Y,"Whats the point of getting an Iphone? I mean sure the camera and the processor and epic Screen. But most phones which are cheaper than the Iphone have that too. And a real photographer wont use a phone for taking photographs, he probably owns a Go-pro for action shots and a DSLR for other Photos. I own an Iphone 6s, and I've never used the 3D touch feature.(I find it useless) The phone is so thin, I don't get it. Its like you have to buy a thick cover in order to feel that it is in your hand and that it doesn't slip off the moment you take it out of your pocket. I mean sure, its so expensive that the person who owns one can show off with it: \\n\\nX: Damn bruh I got myself and Iphone\\nY: Damn you so riccch\\nMe: Whats the point in spending so much money over an apple, I mean get better shit for cheap. Even their laptops are shit. I'm just saying, I wouldn't spend money to buy a phone so I could tell the public that I'm rich in an indirect way.\\n\\nPlus whats the point? I mean, every year there is like a new Iphone which is basically the same thing with a better processor. For the Iphone X, Face recognition seriously? How the fuck is someone gonna unlock the phone if he/she is in an emergency situation and he/she has Siri disabled? He/she would probably get killed before his/her Iphone recognises his/her sweaty face(Sweat due to panic). They should have kept the Fingerprint scanner.\\n\\nAnyways, this is my opinion. If you are buying the Iphone 8/X, then congratulations to you.",0,0

W7DErx-Yg9g,"Awesome video!  Makes me want to watch the show.\\n\\nIs there any chance you could be convinced to do some of the Dragon Age franchise songs?\\n\\nI Am the One in particular has both an English version in Inquisition and an elven version in Origins in the end credits.  The start screen of Origins also has an awesome elf language song in the opening screen, if you could find the words to it.  I used to leave the splash screen up until that song stopped playing, just to listen to it, then listened to it in the start screen when the game opened.  Your version would probably be even better.  There's also Leliana's Song in Origins, and it's also in the made-up elf language.  I prefer the start screen song if I had to pick, but many would prefer Leliana's Song.\\n\\nPlus Dragon Age: Inquisition is full of bard songs, if one took an interest in them.  I Am the One and Once We Were are my favorites in Inquisition, offhand, but other people like happier tunes.",0,1

My guess or opinion is besides the genetic predisposition,maybe the chronic consumption of really spicy food may have just really irritated the mucosal lining on your guts.

People you don't even know praying for you sending all that love and positive energy your way. I keep you in my prayers and pray that you respond well to the treatment you are getting.

6O7x7-srbHI,"Chemotherapy should already be illegal, but it’s not. Many Americans don’t even know that the success rate of chemo is only 2.3% and failing to overcome cancer sits at 97.7% on average. 75% of oncologists and also general doctors wouldn’t recommend chemotherapy to a family member, and they wouldn’t do it themselves either. So it leaves us wondering why others need to go through chemo if doctors wouldn’t go near it.\\n\\nWhat happens with chemo is that it turns the body more acid and because of that, more cancer cells can thrive. It could kill the ones the patients already have, but it sets the right environment for other cancer cells to multiply.\\n\\nChemotherapy kills good gut bacteria and lowers human immunity. Doing so, the person loses their ability to fight cancer and even other diseases. A good analogy to explain how chemotherapy works is to imagine that you are in a swimming pool, and someone dumps a ton of toxic pesticide next to you just to kill a few bugs in the water.",1,0

Once they rebooted the canon, and started rebuilding and fleshing out the characters, I am still excited and intrigued. But, that's me. I'm a die hard Star Wars fan. I didn't hate Episode 1. I tolerate Episode 2, and I enjoyed Episode 3. I didn't crumble into a bloody mess when George Lucas enhanced the original movies. I just enjoy Star Wars and lose myself in the adventure.

I just go see the movies enjoy the fun of them go home thank god i dont have to over analyze everything about the movies i see it would kill watching movies for me.On a side note i miss how happy u guys use to be around when the Avengers first movie came out thank god for Roth she at least tries to keep it positive or else this would just bum me out still luv u guys thoe lol.,0,0

L3O6LocRoTo,"+ScreenJunkies News ,Thank you for mentioning all the natural disasters and offering to show ways to lend help (yet still leaving out Florida, for some odd reason). I usually post long comments to these videos, but *some great relief organizations* are: The Red Cross (American and International), AmeriCares, Direct Relief International, OXFAM, International Relief Teams, CARE, GlobalMedic, ShelterBox, Relief International. (As well as several faith based charities, but I listened the highest rated non-government and non-sectarian agencies, as they tend to appeal to the widest audience of donating people in the U.S. and abroad.) Source: https://www.raptim.org/focus-on-ngos-34-disaster-relief-organizations/ \\n+Roth Cornet ,I've come to think of you more as my optimistic but slightly subversive dirty step-sister (because I'm not your colleague or a drinking buddy/friend). +Andy Signore ,sorry but +Lon Harris has already been proposed as the grumpy and loving grandpa. Try again big guy. (a suggestion in reference to the original WKRP) And I really like seeing +Joe Starr and +Spencer J Gilbert come in on the SJU desk often, but when someone like yourself and +Dan Murrell are away, can we have more variety of guest hosts? Like: +Hal Rudnik (he was good on the show that guessed the opening weekend box office for 'IT'), +Jay Washington (he's always funny), +Jenny Nicholson (she does well with these Star Wars topics, of course), and both +Billy Business & +Lon Harris did nice work in your seat Andy.

L3O6LocRoTo,this movie will be centered solely around dialogue in the original trilogy because it will be another set of call backs just like Rogue One because why wouldnt Disney want to ruin another movie? JJ Abrams also directing Return Of The Jedi Part 2 im not too excited for. A New Hope ---The Force Awakens scene for scene,1,1
L3O6LocRoTo,"I completely agree with you guys. When did we become so fixated on learning everything about these characters. I hate when movies spoon feed us all this information. It's similar to video games now a days where everything is too easy and we're explained every  little thing before starting the first level. Whereas before we had to figure it out as we go. I miss the mystery and intrigue.  It's the role reason i hated Rogue One and why I'm not going to see the Han Solo movie. Sorry, I just had to rant a bit. Carry on.",1,1
L3O6LocRoTo,"When Disney bought Star Wars, I knew the brand would never be the same again. Sure we can make some great arguments for why the prequels didn't deserve to exist, but at least Lucas was trying to do somethings different with those. Disney Star Wars is just so damn derivative of what has already come, I just can't immerse myself as much anymore. \\n\\nAnd while I did like Rogue One and thought it was a well made film, seeing it one time was enough. All of these Disney films feel like novelty films, not anything really moving the narrative along. I think the next Star Wars film is going to have to really take some long strides in building a new story arc, otherwise, it's just the same recycled stuff over and over again.",1,2

L3O6LocRoTo,"*warning: overanalzying* *pretty good overanalyzing though* So there's a specific cultural reason that aunt has to be a part of dirty aunt Roth, because the joke is meant to poke fun at Roth being vaguely dirty (initially that's what it was), and there's only a few contexts for one adult to call another adult out for being dirty... if one of them is a huge Puritan, or if there's some sort of additional context that makes it not appropriate, specifically the context of a young kid being around. To a child, or at least a teen, Roth would be aunt Roth. She's not the other SJ guys' aunt in that context, she's aunt Roth in the way that adults come to refer to each other by their relations, and the guys would be uncle this or that.  This context is also in part a result of their awareness of a younger skewing audience, so Roth may also be seen as the viewer's aunt. Annnnyway...",1,1
L3O6LocRoTo,"For Watchmen, I'm indifferent.  The killing point is going to be if there milking the story line (I never read it), and the show turns into the last season of GoTs, or worse <name a CW super hero show>. I really liked the Leftovers (& HBO) so.....there's a little hope.",0,0

However, i was able to venture out without my wallet or phone - i just paid with apple pay and still felt connect to the world with messages etc.\\nMore or less, if your phone gets an LTE signal then your watch will too - if youre in a 3G area, then your watch wont work (apart from a few countries with the additional bands).\\nIf you only get 2G or no phone signal (such as out in the ocean) then your watch wont work.",0,0

lse3oJfPPk4,"Uh oh, this is the first time I’ve heard that LTE on the watch ups your bill by $10/mo. That’s a tough sell over the life of the watch, unless you’re a heavy user leaving the phone at home. Personally, I’ll keep my series 2 because why would I leave my phone at home? I walk 5 mi./day with the phone around my ankle and my Apple earbuds, and work the phone from my watch, perfect setup.",0,0

Battery is life is superior without LTE.

I have no doubt Apple has worked some great engineering to get the ground plane folded somehow into the screen, I don't see how they can make it long enough for frequencies below 900Mhz to work well enough. That's why most other LTE watches have used the wrist band as part of the ground plane.",0,0

They can't go back now that they're releasing that phone. Hence why waiting another year especially if you have the 7 is a good idea if you want an Apple phone that is.,1,0

Just before I was diagnosed, I had this desperate urge to recover, and for a while I felt so good about how I was doing. However, the discomfort and fear spiraled out of control after diagnosis solely because of the way people reacted. I had lost so much weight so quickly before being diagnosed that as soon as I got home, people started warning me that I would gain weight and blow up like a balloon if I wasn't careful. Some were well-meaning, and others were just rude, but I was constantly barricaded with I'll give you a small piece. You're going to make your diabetes get worse or should you be eating that? Is that okay? Can you have that? There's this constant feeling that everyone thinks I have type 1 because I was overweight, lazy, and constantly overeating. Someone even asked me when I was diagnosed if I had a binging problem. \\nOnce I was listening to a speaker who was tossing out pieces of candy to whoever answered a question, and in front of everyone she looked at me and said, i know I can't give you any, but good answer. I was humiliated.\\nCompared to the shame, vulnerability, and public humiliation of an eating disorder and having type 1 (even though no one gives themselves type 1, and they can eat just like normal people), the pain of being diagnosed with an incurable disorder was quite literally nothing. I'm still scared to take enough insulin because I associate it with weight gain and the negative stereotypes that people ignorantly transfer from type two. It's wrong, but I'm ashamed of the word diabetes. My AIC has been over nine for most of the past five years, and even my doctor told me I was unmotivated to take care of myself. I'm at a loss, honestly, and in the most brutal form of honestly I think I'll die pretty young.",0,0

tSLjM6cZaTo,I've always seen diabetes as a whole life kind of disease that also needs a whole life kind of treatment. Like many chronic illnesses. If you have alcoholism and diabetes you have to understand that the problem is not diabetes just because the person isn't taking his/hers insulin. It not the alcohol. ITS THE REASON THAT MAKES YOU DRINK THAT IS THE PROBLEM. Alcohol is just an affect of something not working in that persons life. Remove/fix/manage that reson for alcohol and the reason to take insulin will increase. And that is applicable onto all chronicle diseases. There's no ONE FIX for it. Fixing one thing wont change everything. But treating it as a whole will. Its a matter of life and life quality. Increase that and the medication will follow suit. I'm sad to see that the health care system in the UK is so divorced when it comes to treating chronicle illness. It cant be just a problem for diabulimia. Its probably a symptom noticeable all over the health care system of the UK.,0,0

tSLjM6cZaTo,"I have known this for years and years. Frightening to here that it s not even in the books and that it s so few clinics that can enough about it. Maby they know, but aren't allowed to take them in becaus they need extra expertise?  Maby they are scared of the extra risk of them dying...I don't know, but it is a bit shocking to here that in this day and age, so  few places can take that group. Hope it gets better. Scary the extra complications this group of people gets from not taking enough insulin. It's also part of the problem with other types of eating disorders that are being hard to treat. Such as drug addicts that also have eating disorders and are scared of getting clean or can't stay clean becaus of the drastic waight gain and sudden food cravings that usually happens when they stop using. Have been to rehabs whole my life until I got my child and had to put her first and quit. \\nHalf, if not more if the girls there and some of the boys, had an underlying eating disorder that made recovery impossible over time. Suddenly all the emotions and bad self esteem popps up and on top of that they /we had yo deal with the, for many if us, bad waight gain that made some of us hate our body's even more, and control and dealing with emotions, is nit somthing addicts are espeshally good at. On top of that the guilt, loss of family /friends, and having to start all at scratch. So to me, I think it's sad that the rehab places don't talk about that, or can help with that, becaus the results would have been so much better, if they understood that that is often the underlying big problem. On top of everything else!  \\nAlso people with both drug or psykiatric illnesses, are to hard patients to treat. They are to much for the psykiatric fasileties and to much for the drug rehabs!  Maby not in every contry, but in my little contry, that is a problem. Dual treatment clinics or smaller that speshalises in dobbel illnesses /addictions, are every much needed  in the future and in more places. \\nHope the girls in this video are doing better!  Try to get help now becaus it s sooo hard to been something  /enough, when your helth is bad. Recovery is much esyer ears later, if you can work and have enough securety and money to have a netter life. When the organs shutt down, even if they get better, everything gets harder later too, if can fake years after recovery, and you have to pay, and your children becaus all the things we take got granted, are limitated. You can have any good life anyway, but as erlier you can get out, the esyer it is for the body to work later... The dammage on the apperanse is smaller. It s later, the helth can get worse... Thats not things you think about when your in it. Often people give up and expect to die erlier. But dying isn't the hard part, it s living with a body that are tired all the time and not being strong enough yo be who you need to be for your loved ones. When the esy things are hard, when your teeth fall out Android the little money you have, for years and years goes to pay for dentists and your metabolism is slow and you have to take medisins with tough side effects. You can't burden your family for ever and I promise that your biggest wish will be, why couldn't I try harder erlier! It's harder than normal people can understand, but  please, try harder! The years goes by so fast! If you dare to change now, or try even, chanses are your life and everyone that cares about you, are being so much better, also in your future. Looking sick, isn't as bad while young, but it's harder later, and I talk about that becaus self esteem and  selfish immage, goes hand in hand, forget mohst of us, even if it shouldn't. And the body ages so much faster when not helthy. Young people often don't care, but trust me you care when you're a mom or nor, but try to fit in society later!  The hard part is that even if you are lucky to have  people /family in your life that wants to spend time with you, it s often you that push them away becaus you can get to tired and never know how your body feels, so planning gets harder.  I hope by telling this, I can get one person to think that it is soooo worth doing your best this time to try to be nice to your body, becaus later, the  dammage to  your body, can steal the person you can be and make your life harder than you desurv... \\nI also hope people can understand that recovery is a process. It s not a quick fix and go to rehab onse and recover of you are a bad person. Many needs to crash and try again, becaus its so layered and hard to dare to change and keep changing.But it is doeble for mohst! Hope I havent scared someone. May deleete thus later, becaus I might scare someone instead of helping. Not many will read it anyways, but I hope it can get one to maby think it's worth the fight. Not everyone gets problems later , but too many do! 🌪🌩🌥⛅🌞🌫🌞",0,0

evvVtqmvE5w,"Coyote, I've been watching your videos for a long time and I've never been disappointed with them, that is until now. This dangerous spider you're holding is a Nephila clavipes or Golden Orb Weaver, one of the most docile and harmless spiders out there. I get that you're trying to get views through making it look like you are in some sort of danger, but for a long time I thought that your channel was about educating people about nature and animals. But what you are doing right here is LYING to people who don't know better. These spiders are actually very common all around the world, your description and the information that you give about the spider might provoke people to kill this wonderful creature on sight, which is the opposite of what your channel's message should be. I've held these spiders on multiple occasions and I've never been bitten or even anywhere near being in danger of being harmed by this spider. I don't know if what you are doing is deliberate or you are just misinformed and didn't do proper research. You might of been thinking of Phoneutria fera (Wandering spider) which actually is a VERY dangerous species (and also called the banana spider), I dare you to handle that one my friend, you WILL actually get bitten pretty much right off the bat.

IvFw9zhIYkQ,the reason video game movies are not good is because they never stay true to the source materials.,0,0
IvFw9zhIYkQ,Who's playing the games in the background?,0,0
IvFw9zhIYkQ,"I think since we are in a time where everything is so real, graphics, etc to give consumers a greater experience during gameplay that like you said making those games into solid movies will be challenging. Add to it that we are now in a world that wants everything right now and knowing how things are made, behind the scenes, yada, yada, yada.\\n\\nSome of these games have crazy budgets, so imagine the movie budgets and then if the movie being made doesn't get the same budget or love as the game and its content. 🤔 I wasn't into this game or movie like that. Just wasn't my thing. But let there be a Kingdom Hearts movie, mannnnnn, lol. As fun and as beautiful as that game is, I'd like to see it as a movie, but then again would it be necessary though???",0,0
IvFw9zhIYkQ,"I have legitimately enjoyed playing the two newest Tomb Raider reboot. They're really fun and I like that version of Lara. And as much as I would really like to enjoy the movie, the trailer for me looks so much like a rehash of stuff I already played that I don't have any desire to spend money on a movie theater ticket to see it. I probably will get it at a Redbox for a dollar. But I think for Studios to have success with the video game movies, they need to have the people who write the stories for the video games, write the scripts for the movies. Make the movie canon for further game stories. Stop trying to rehash things we already saw or played. These games already have a universe. They should just tell the story that already fit into that existing Universe. It's not like you can't watch on YouTube all of the cutscenes edited together into a movie to catch up if you haven't played the game! You can definitely pick up in the middle.\\n\\nI think that was what was really annoying with the Assassin's Creed movie. I really wanted to enjoy that movie! My husband and I love playing those games. They are some of our favorites. But they completely changed so much from the existing universe that it was really like watching a completely different thing. They erased things that made Assassin's Creed's universe unique and turn it into something else with the Assassin's Creed label on it. It was just a generic time travel sci-fi movie. It had very little to do with the story that those of us who have played every single game know. And that's dumb! That was a huge missed opportunity especially for Ubisoft to propel some of their story further.\\n\\nThat said, I really hope that the Tomb Raider movie will be awesome. I hope that it will be more than just entertaining. I hope that it will serve a purpose in the world that Lara Croft existed. I hope that it's not just a two-hour commercial full of video game play and cutscenes I've already played.",0,0

IvFw9zhIYkQ,I would like to see a died rising movie ... oh wait there’s night of the living dead already ... I can care 3 nuts of a flys ass ! MAKE THAT MOVIE !!! ... RIP George Romero,0,0
IvFw9zhIYkQ,I think it's awk since I wouldn't see a video game movie unless I played the game and to get mass appeal I'd think the movie would have to stray away from whatever lore was built into the game so I think it leaves you in a pickle either go for mass appeal (like you should since that's the goal) or go for the players. If you go mass appeal and everyone talks about it being based on a game average people will be like I haven't played that game why would I see it (barring any amazing trailer) Then if you go for the gamers who played the game which narrows your audience and then out of that pool they have to want to actually go see it when it may simply be a retread of the game they love just a little fancier. So it seems like a lose lose to me unless it's with a game property that is universally known like Mario or Zelda but even then you need all your ducks in a row otherwise you'll wind up with more failed attempts so it's hard and I don't know if we'll get there but hopefully.,0,0

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"Resident Evil also deviated from the Video Games plot and story. I don't know why they feel they need to do that.

It just the causal movie viewers feel like they might have to do Home work to get it, which is not a good smart. Assassin's Creed biggest problem was there 3 great ideas in there that could of been there own individual movies. Silent Hill (personal favourite) should of been a little more understanding as if your not a fan of the games you might be left thinking WTF.  It also help if you hire a director that cares for the material or you get things like House of the Dead and the later Resident Evil  film.",0,0

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"I don't think movies have to follow a game's plot, depending on the series. If its something like tomb raider, there are plenty of stories you can tell. Video games are a interactive entertainment experience, I can't lump or compare the two because in my eyes they are not really related. Games require much more work, and the reason you come back to them can vary. Example: If you play games like Zelda or Prof. Layton because you enjoy puzzles, a movie adaptation may not feel right to you no matter what the plot is, because you’re given nothing to solve on your own.",0,0
IvFw9zhIYkQ,"I think an adaptation of a video game only makes sense when the movie can bring something to the game either action-wise or story-wise. If for example, you can make action scenes better, because you are not hindered by the game mechanics, that works. And if you can make a better story because the story of the game was flawed, that also can work.\\n\\nI can't really see how a Tomb Raider movie can improve story or action of the game as both were pretty good, making a movie kind of unnecessary.

Almost like a variation of sorts. Like you want the story to still be similar, but having surprises and even tangents that weren't explored within the source make it new and exciting for all.",0,0
IvFw9zhIYkQ,"I had the same reaction you did with the trailers. Looks good, but we'll see. I agree with the notion about Mortal Kombat being good for following the story.

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"I love detailed stories in video games but I think movies have to be careful in bringing a video game to life. To me a video game that would make a good movie would have to met a few expectations. \\n\\n1. Gameplay is not essential to the story. In games where gameplay is essential to being a part of the story (strategy games, stealth games, puzzle games, skill games, etc) a movie would lost those elements making it fundamentally a bad representation of the game. Imagine a GTA movie, basically it would be the Fast and Furious the fun of killing people, stealing cars, and the absurdity of it all would be lost in a movie.\\n2. No multiple endings. By creating a movie based off game with multiple endings you are choosing an ending which then everybody who doesn't agree with that ending or would have done things differently now thinks the movie is wrong. If an ending is to be chosen let the game developers chose it when making a sequel. Imagine a Persona 5 movie, there are so many alternate endings that no fan would truly be satisfied.\\n3. No create your own character games. Games where a player has to chose a sex and race of the character would face similar problems to number two. No one would be satisfied. Not to mention that every group would get up in arms over whomever the director chose. Imagine a Fallout 4 movie, do you make the Sole Survivor a white male, a white female, a black male, black female, etc? No option is a good bet to avoid public backlash.\\n4. No super strict lore. Though stories with lose in game lore would face difficulties making a movie based off a game that has strict lore would probably make people even madder. One thing wrong or changed and that's all anyone focuses on. We see plenty of examples like recently the Assassin's Creed movie.\\n\\nTo me the best way to make a movie from a video game is to never follow the main story line of any game but make it lore accurate. I think Warcraft had the right idea and would have been a great movie if they had gotten the lore right. It is telling a story that players have never seen before but have heard about, meaning we can't really compare it to the game. The downfall was the lore errors. Make a movie within a video game world but not of a video game - for example - Batman: Assault on Arkham; technically takes place within the Batman Arkham universe but doesn't copy a game, because those stories have been told already. If you want a live action movie do a game within the Fallout universe but instead of Fallout 4 show us what is happening in Houston, TX or Chicago, IL; or show us the Conquering of Tameriel by Thanos. Just make sure these movies are lore accurate.",0,0

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"IMO, you shouldn't recreate a story that gamers already have experienced on an interactive level and now you're asking them to just sit and watch an abbreviated version of that? Keep the key, core elements that makes a franchise appealing in the first place and leave the rest up to a good script writer and director to make it a fun movie. Let video games be video games and let movies be movies. With Tomb Raider, there's not a lot you need to ask from them. Give Lara charisma, dual pistols and a globe trotting adventure w/ tombs and such. That should be easy for Hollywood to make a fun movie with. If you can't massage a video game property or it's story into a decent movie format, then maybe it should never have been a movie in the first place?",0,0

But instead they just listen to greed and force people to spend hundreds of dollars to try and gamble for the items in game they want.. like a cool camo or emote and it just pisses me off that people can get so greedy and careless.

Like people want a Grand Theft Auto movie, how about just make a movie about Niko Bellic and how his time in the war changed him or his European crime life that caused him to flee to America in the first place. Use them to give certain characters more screen time that the game didn't. Going back to assassins creed, I love Connor from AC3 and me and people who don't like him would agree that if he had a sequel to explore more of his character that would've been a great idea; so why give him a movie about him dealing with the events of the previous games.

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"Good topic. I think a good way for a film adaptation of video games is to make them their own unique story while keeping it canon to the source material. It could be a progressing story that's either a sequel or prequel. That way, when a later installment of the game is released, one player would question what happened previously, and another player would say Oh, you'd have to watch the movie to find out what happened. I think that idea would drive interest to see the movie and play the games.",0,0
IvFw9zhIYkQ,"Extra Credits has a great ep discussing some of the reasons I think making a good adaption is difficult (linked here) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnP2boSC-FM  Moreover though, games have gotten to the point where story rules in certain game genres but has yet to get to the depths that a film could reach. This might have something to do with the very nature of games where you interact within a game with agency which is not something you can do with a film. It's definitely a cash grab by studios though, because the game industry is so lucrative, because everyone is grabbing for an MCU style system and because making film is expensive and there is a need to look for a good return on investment with much of what is made today. The film industry is weird that way...because as much as I think film can be art, it is also inextricably tied to business and profit. Games are in some ways an outgrowth of that same idea, just much earlier along in the process. I just want more original stuff out there, I will just go play the game if I want that first original experience, there's no need to create a film experience as well unless you're going to bring something new or expansive to what I'm watching.

IvFw9zhIYkQ,"This is the biggest problem with game-based films. What makes a game great is not necessarily translatable to the silver screen. Tetris is one of the most popular games ever, but I doubt you could make a movie out of stacking boxes. Likewise, 120 minutes of a fat Italian man jumping on turtles would probably not break the box office.\\n\\nThe reason is (partly) this: In a game you react to the action because you are actually performing it. It doesn't matter if you are Crash Bandicoot, Lara Croft or Heihachi Mishima. There doesn't need to be a story line. Most classic games just had one screen of text explaining the backstory, which was essentially unnecessary to the enjoyment of the game. The princess has been kidnapped. Somebody set us up the bomb!\\nIn a film, the writer, director and actor all need to work together to make us understand the character and empathize with him/her/it. If they don't, we have no connection to the character - and therefore to the action - and we're just watching a two hour long parkour video.\\n\\nGame franchises that have more of a story line are (for the reasons listed above) almost universally awful as movies, and only appeal to fans of the games. The true test is to show the movie to an audience who has never heard of the game franchise and see if they like it. We who are fans of a franchise are often blind to the shortcomings of these films, we remember our feelings from playing the game, and transpose them onto the film.\\n\\nThe only way to make it work IMO is to give the backstory, setting and characters to real screen writers and have them write a script that isn't a recreation of the game. Get a real director and make him direct the movie based on this script, not the game. It looks like this is what they did here.",2,1

It's difficult to spread and feels drying even though I'm oily....although Instill get oily. I really want to like it. The shade range irritates me: in the UK, the lightest warm shade that can be purchased (or that seems to be in stock) is W2W. Which is like an NC25 at least; so I had to purchase from the US and have the shade lighter W1W, sent over....which is still a hair too dark for my NC15 skin tone.",0,0

And the only way you can sample them to find out if you even like the scent is to visit the store. That's just bullshit. Who do they think they are? Do they think their product is so special and exclusive that only certain people deserve it? No way I'm buying their perfume now.

These people who think they’re making a difference by boycotting their team/NFL, may not be spending their money on seats or merchandise are really only fooling themselves. What they don’t realize is, for every seat in the stadiums they leave unoccupied, someone who doesn’t give a shit about your cause will spend their money, fill those seats, and buy that merchandise. For every person not buying a ticket, there are literally thousands waiting in line who will. Well, maybe not for the shitty teams who can’t sell out a stadium lol, but most can and do.

A778dMvbrJg,"Stop putting all your blame on the NFL. I understand that people die for the flag and for our rights in this great country. But be honest with yourself, is everyone rights in this country are being protect. The cop that die in the robbery (God bless his soul,rip) that you speak of, does that justify or equal out the action of  corrupt/ unlawful cops that are killing innocent lives. Because a lot of good cops died in the line of duty doesn't eliminate the cold facts of what going on in this country. America is drenched in corruption, its only going to get worse if the true problem is solve. We most stand together against corruption no matter where it is, in the streets or in the government or in the ones that vow to protect in serve. People are waking up and it is getting easier for the truth to be reached, especially with filming, etc. we most face the problem head on and eliminate every piece of corruption. Or his great country with fall as the Roman Empire fell way back. Unity is what makes us great, but when we divided, knowing it or not, we are all doom. Players in the NFL found this is the only way they could Express there stand, I'm not saying it's the best way but didn't it get a lot of people attention. But people lack to see the full picture as it is but instead they like to choose what they want to see. I strongly believe the worse is to come, people will not look to law to seek justice but to one ownself form of justice. Hammurabi code- an eye for an eye. Or even worse  an eye for eyes. This will come, cause history due repeat itself due to human ignorance. It's sad, in this Modern day of life full with technology and  full potential of greatness as a species, we fall to primitive behaviors of separation of our own, greed, etc. those we lead to our down fall, that we been continuously repeating through known history. This needs to change, this must change, this have to change. Or we won't be in existence no least a country.

I definitely wish I didn't do what I did but in the moment I couldn't stop. My eyesight is worse but I don't have any other problems as a result of this disease.,0,0

tSLjM6cZaTo,"I'm blown away by this video. \\n\\nMy best friend has Type 1 diabetes and I always tried to support her as she was struggling with the disease throughout her teenage years. We were like sisters, we would even spend Christmas Day together. After years of friendship, about age 16, she purposefully began to let her health deteriorate. Her blood sugar levels were through the roof, at risk of gangrene and so was admitted to hospital every few months and I always came with her. During these stays the doctors pleaded with her to monitor her BSL, they even gave her a diary to keep track of every meal and her insulin doses. She refused to write in it, she refused to take insulin, she snuck in snacks without telling anyone, without taking any insulin. I couldn't understand. Why was my friend doing this, why was she killing herself right in front of me, why wouldn't she let me help? I offered to write in her insulin diary for her, I thought she didn't want to deal with the disease as she was always telling me how much she hated that she was diabetic. Now, looking back, I can finally understand. It was Diabulimia. She told me she hated that the insulin made her have lumps on her belly and bum and thighs. She told me it made her look fat. I told her it didn't. But I didn't understand that she was crying out for help because of a disease that no one knew she had. I told her I couldn't stand to watch her harm herself anymore and selfishly cut off contact. \\n\\nI think I need to ring her tomorrow, I hope she'll forgive me.",0,0

tSLjM6cZaTo,"I suffered from eating disorders for four years until I developed type 1. Just before I was diagnosed, I had this desperate urge to recover, and for a while I felt so good about how I was doing. However, the discomfort and fear spiraled out of control after diagnosis solely because of the way people reacted. I had lost so much weight so quickly before being diagnosed that as soon as I got home, people started warning me that I would gain weight and blow up like a balloon if I wasn't careful. Some were well-meaning, and others were just rude, but I was constantly barricaded with I'll give you a small piece. You're going to make your diabetes get worse or should you be eating that? Is that okay? Can you have that? There's this constant feeling that everyone thinks I have type 1 because I was overweight, lazy, and constantly overeating. Someone even asked me when I was diagnosed if I had a binging problem. \\nOnce I was listening to a speaker who was tossing out pieces of candy to whoever answered a question, and in front of everyone she looked at me and said, i know I can't give you any, but good answer. I was humiliated.\\nCompared to the shame, vulnerability, and public humiliation of an eating disorder and having type 1 (even though no one gives themselves type 1, and they can eat just like normal people), the pain of being diagnosed with an incurable disorder was quite literally nothing. I'm still scared to take enough insulin because I associate it with weight gain and the negative stereotypes that people ignorantly transfer from type two. It's wrong, but I'm ashamed of the word diabetes. My AIC has been over nine for most of the past five years, and even my doctor told me I was unmotivated to take care of myself. I'm at a loss, honestly, and in the most brutal form of honestly I think I'll die pretty young.",0,0

tSLjM6cZaTo,"I can't even imagine what these women struggle with on a daily basis.\\n\\nIf I'd been diabetic with the option of reducing insulin for weight loss during the midst of my darkest bulimia days, you bet your ass I would have done so. It sounds tempting even now, a year into recovery. It was torture to me when I was forbidden to exercise and I am an avoid-physical-movement-at-all-costs-because-I-don't-like-the-way-my-fat-jiggles-when-I-move, self-induced vomit, purging sub-type (sorry for the graphic imagery; that's just the way it was and, thankfully, things are much better now). \\n\\nAnyhow, that required limitation of movement in addition to the compulsory guzzling of Ensures/inhaling of behemoth portions of food was hard enough.

tSLjM6cZaTo,I've always seen diabetes as a whole life kind of disease that also needs a whole life kind of treatment. Like many chronic illnesses. If you have alcoholism and diabetes you have to understand that the problem is not diabetes just because the person isn't taking his/hers insulin. It not the alcohol. ITS THE REASON THAT MAKES YOU DRINK THAT IS THE PROBLEM. Alcohol is just an affect of something not working in that persons life. Remove/fix/manage that reson for alcohol and the reason to take insulin will increase. And that is applicable onto all chronicle diseases. There's no ONE FIX for it. Fixing one thing wont change everything. But treating it as a whole will. Its a matter of life and life quality. Increase that and the medication will follow suit. I'm sad to see that the health care system in the UK is so divorced when it comes to treating chronicle illness. It cant be just a problem for diabulimia. Its probably a symptom noticeable all over the health care system of the UK.,0,0

It's difficult to spread and feels drying even though I'm oily....although Instill get oily. I really want to like it. The shade range irritates me: in the UK, the lightest warm shade that can be purchased (or that seems to be in stock) is W2W. Which is like an NC25 at least; so I had to purchase from the US and have the shade lighter W1W, sent over....which is still a hair too dark for my NC15 skin tone.",0,0

WfjZ1otkS3o,I feel like social justice warriors and liberals are actually causing more racism. I think a lot of comments aren't really directed towards a certain minority. People just got sick of stupid extreme liberals trying to enforce their thinking on people. People are fighting back by triggering these SJW. Yes there are racists. And they can be of any skin color. But a lot of people aren't really hateful towards someone over skin color. People want to do the exact opposite of SJWs. If they say you can't be racist than people will just say watch me. These stupid weak liberals have tried to push white people in a corner. Which has caused people to actually start talking about race just to try and defend themselves. Now people are actually looking at databases of black violence and actually speaking up thinking they need to defend themselves just because they're white. And that's when people start getting pissed off. When you try to make a race be sorry for their skin color than you have another thing coming,0,0

Keep making excuses and being docile while turning the other cheeks. Keep saying not all cops are bad or not all whites are bad. The good whites; who are not racist will speak up for you. They will die for you, they will march with you. There are more 130 million white people in america. The good white percentage is too small for me. Keep listening and advocating for a MLK and it's non-violent resistance. Keep believing in those con artist priest selling you a delusional of a fairytale god. Keep believing in those so called black Leaders telling you not to be a rebel. In my humble opinion , MLK was indoctrinated and bought , Nelson Mandela  was definetely indoctrinated in 27 years of capivity and was bought too. Tell me I am wrong? Never listen to anyone telling you violence is not the way. White people love talking about non-violence when they are the most violent people in the world. Did you think they just politely told the Native Americans to move to a reservation, the aborigines to share their land,  or politely told the Africans to migrate from Africa to America and be enslaved? Keep being black. That's the only thing you think you got going good for yourselves. They got you exactly where they want. Stay black and pround, my ass!",2,0

fmIGnd98DX4,"Fighter Workout Tip: End of the day you only NEED two things. Nice set of reasonable weight dumb bells (10 for newer folks, 20-25 goal. Higher if bigger person) and a really durable heavy bag. That and some god damn discipline is all you need to not only get your body in order, but do so in a way that gives you a very natural build. Nothing overly stressful, very little chance of injury unless you're a fucking imbecile, and exceptionally relaxing afterwards. I'm telling you, NOTHING like just going apeshit on a heavybag to make a shitty day a bit better. Put in what you want to get out. 5-10 minutes a day, or a few hours.

cq50fkILrwM,"I'm surprised you liked the Estée Lauder Double Wear BB Cushion: I'm opposite on the skin- type spectrum to you- I am very oily. I've never liked the EL Double Wear, because it tends to look heavy. I find the same with the BB Cushion. Maybe I'm using it wrong. It's difficult to spread and feels drying even though I'm oily....although Instill get oily. I really want to like it. The shade range irritates me: in the UK, the lightest warm shade that can be purchased (or that seems to be in stock) is W2W. Which is like an NC25 at least; so I had to purchase from the US and have the shade lighter W1W, sent over....which is still a hair too dark for my NC15 skin tone.",0,0

And we're still having the same discrimination going on. These little speeches do nothing to those who just hate. Some of your favorite youtubers have most likely done or said something racist. But the world is gonna continue to move forward regardless. Start ignoring it and stop being shocked that these speeches have to happen. People who even work for our country are racist.

No more water of any sort, only distilled to remove the build up inside your joints and your body.  The body can be 100% rebuilt and every disease 100% cured, including viruses.  \\nCut anything that can cause inflammation; all oils, except butter.  Totally cut gluten!  Eat soft and running eggs; 8-9 daily.  Try this for 2 weeks minimum and witness miracles!  I was in tears realizing all my joints got rebuilt.  I implore you try this. \\nAlso lookup detoxification with food-grade peroxide.  You will get you health and your active life back...\\nAlso, running is not good for anyone, any doctor will tell you that.  Try jump rope or a trampoline.

I've never liked the EL Double Wear, because it tends to look heavy. I find the same with the BB Cushion. Maybe I'm using it wrong. It's difficult to spread and feels drying even though I'm oily....although Instill get oily. I really want to like it. The shade range irritates me: in the UK, the lightest warm shade that can be purchased (or that seems to be in stock) is W2W. Which is like an NC25 at least; so I had to purchase from the US and have the shade lighter W1W, sent over....which is still a hair too dark for my NC15 skin tone.",0,0

Its so sad, because you do this in every video and it almost feel like youre not being candid to your viewers. I hope you change the way you do the info bar in the future :)",1,4

I was in the Air Force in the seventies, tho I am dark complected to the extent that I was often mistaken for Latino. My views were NOT welcome just as they are not today. Treating everyone equally is not a problem, most always their interpretation of your meaning is racist and biggoted. I am not full white, nor am I full native American and white, yet, I was often the target of racial indifference, to the point that I just started going my own way, so as a result of that, I was racist because I refused to be the target and mingle with any if my fellow soldiers. I was forced to go to ethnic cleansing classes disguised as stereotype classes. It was indoctrination to tell me my white linage is worthless and the native American portion has no rights except that of a 3/5 human. I learned to keep my mouth shut. My desire to become a career soldier was dashed against the stones on the beach of life, I was refused re enlistment. It was devistateing, took me to well past thirty to get over it and finally get sober. I do not, nor do I condone, racist activity, yet I see it daily from both sides of the spectrum. It has become acceptable for Latino, blacks and Asians to be racist, but not so for others. Kinda like feminism, if you want equality, act equal, if you want supremecy go to stereotype school and learn to be a man or woman. But please grow up, this is getting rediculous.",0,0

4WNHB8vROg4,<3 thank you for sharing his last moments on stage with us kim <3 saw Tom Petty at Red Rocks in the Denver area when I barely arrived to work with youth after the tragic shooting at Columbine... what a beautiful outdoor concert venue ...!!! ... what funnn !!! they toss marshmallows at one another in the audience before the concert there !!! 😜it was a gorgeous night ... and I didn’t realize til later who was sitting next to me...a blonde by herself in a floppy hat... a picture... larger than life ...flicking her bic and waving it for Tom... it looked to be Marianne Faithful ..!!! He spotted her and played the entire concert nodding to her...in respect ... 🤗 a sweet gesture ... he wore a long dress coat .. I believe purple... or maybe burgundy... his endless 🎸 🎸 🎸 guitars were displayed all out on stage with him ... beautiful...and he switched guitars with every song ! Now that in itself was cool..!!! The music and his voice were IN-CRED-IBLE !!! I was actually bummed at first because I’d missed Santana just before there but when I heard Tom Petty... it blew it all away !!! I’m glad it was my one and only concert at Red Rocks... and that’s my memory of that beautiful place !!! It was a moment in time stolen where I was brought some joy before going into a very tough situation that would change me forever as a responder at Columbine ... <3 That’s why I’d gone out there from my native NH... the only happy memory I had out there during that very difficult time for so many as my heart broke with theirs... and one of the only fun moments since... as life weighed heavier since... I relived my entire time growing up in NH with Toms music that night ...it truly is the soundtrack of our lives... for we who grew up with Tom Petty’s songs... though he wasn’t that much older... THANK YOU TOM PETTY !!! Wish I’d told you in person ...!!! Telling you now... in my heart and soul and where you are now ...  I know you hear me... and so now you’re free fallin ... and you’re learning to fly ... you never needed wings... your music lifted us with you... in a natural high ... I remember now... whenever Id need to feel free... I’d play free fallin’ in my firebird... later .. 🚙 my jeep wrangler and put the roof down...... and drive... just drive....by the beach along the nh seacoast...and the stress would leave me and I’d be free fallin too. l!!  <3 gone too soon ... 😓... Tom Petty...we hardly knew ye.......  <3,0,0

I am not a celebrity/musician idol worshiper but I have to give credit where credit is deserved and in my opinion Tom Petty did good... he seemed to be a humble man.

b6utGZQ9Sks,"It works the same as a sailboat in many ways.  In this case, the water pushes, and a cable holds the boat steady in one direction, causing it to go sideways.  On a sailboat, the wind pushes, and resistance against the (hopefully non-moving) water holds the boat steady in one direction (sailboats can't move sideways easily, only backwards or forwards because of their centerboards/keels and hull shape), causing it to go sideways to the wind (or whatever direction you want).",0,0

WfjZ1otkS3o,for a 3 stars general to say this in 2017 that proves his  leadership has just failed. words wont fix this mess. should have enforced better codes and resolved this problem without  hanging his dirty laundry to the public. this general needs long term vacation. let all the world know and see his lack of sight and management and thus may underestimate all.

I am not a celebrity/musician idol worshiper but I have to give credit where credit is deserved and in my opinion Tom Petty did good... he seemed to be a humble man. I was fortunate to have seen Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers while I was at the ripe old age of 19 on military leave in Pittsburgh back in 1983, what a wonderful birthday gift it was and they sure put on a great concert.",3,0

4WNHB8vROg4,<3 thank you for sharing his last moments on stage with us kim <3 saw Tom Petty at Red Rocks in the Denver area when I barely arrived to work with youth after the tragic shooting at Columbine... what a beautiful outdoor concert venue ...!!! ... what funnn !!! they toss marshmallows at one another in the audience before the concert there !!! 😜it was a gorgeous night ... and I didn’t realize til later who was sitting next to me...a blonde by herself in a floppy hat... a picture... larger than life ...flicking her bic and waving it for Tom... it looked to be Marianne Faithful ..!!! He spotted her and played the entire concert nodding to her...in respect ... 🤗 a sweet gesture ... he wore a long dress coat .. I believe purple... or maybe burgundy... his endless 🎸 🎸 🎸 guitars were displayed all out on stage with him ... beautiful...and he switched guitars with every song ! Now that in itself was cool..!!! The music and his voice were IN-CRED-IBLE !!! I was actually bummed at first because I’d missed Santana just before there but when I heard Tom Petty... it blew it all away !!! I’m glad it was my one and only concert at Red Rocks... and that’s my memory of that beautiful place !!! It was a moment in time stolen where I was brought some joy before going into a very tough situation that would change me forever as a responder at Columbine ... <3 That’s why I’d gone out there from my native NH... the only happy memory I had out there during that very difficult time for so many as my heart broke with theirs... and one of the only fun moments since... as life weighed heavier since... I relived my entire time growing up in NH with Toms music that night ...it truly is the soundtrack of our lives... for we who grew up with Tom Petty’s songs... though he wasn’t that much older... THANK YOU TOM PETTY !!! Wish I’d told you in person ...!!! Telling you now... in my heart and soul and where you are now ...  I know you hear me... and so now you’re free fallin ... and you’re learning to fly ... you never needed wings... your music lifted us with you... in a natural high ... I remember now... whenever Id need to feel free... I’d play free fallin’ in my firebird... later .. 🚙 my jeep wrangler and put the roof down...... and drive... just drive....by the beach along the nh seacoast...and the stress would leave me and I’d be free fallin too. l!!  <3 gone too soon ... 😓... Tom Petty...we hardly knew ye.......  <3,0,0

It’s not the governments fault that ur in the couch all day long instead of going out n looking for a job🤦🏽‍♂️. Niggas always looking for a easy ass job that pays well but show up with no type of experience, no well manners n definitely not at least a diploma. U gotta start off somewhere even if it’s a min wage paying job but instead they want the easy way out n start “flipping” drugs so that they can be lazy all day long. Why can’t they be more like Mexicans who literally start out with nothing, who can’t even drive to work bc even just a drivers license makes such a difference.

NMRvbg-denE,If you want to pin it on her for possibly buying a gun for him. Then you should nail the store that sold it to him. If he needed a licence then the person that signed off on him. It's pretty ridiculous already. I'm sure gun powder residue is all over his hands and face. So im sure they have the right guy. And I'm sure if she knew...  she would've reported him  to authorities or family. The media just puts their nose in and jumps to conclusions.

u8f6k9vjl-A,"You look very fresh in this video, like you barely have makeup on. I love it. Plus i recently saw on instagram you saying that you don't have as many views as you used to. I've been watching you for at least two years and to be honest except for the times when you wouldn't upload for like a month or something (which is understandable because you were shooting) i've really enjoyed watching your videos and that hasn't changed. I can imagine that you are not happy with this situation and i hope you start getting as many views as you used to. I'm actually writing all of this because i would like to give you examples of the videos i love watching so that you can have the idea of what attracts people (or at least me lol). I feel like you do too many hauls and i know a lot of people love them and maybe that's just my opinion but a few hauls of the glasses or lingerie might get a little boring after a while. I love watching kind of sit and talk videos where you share some of your experiences and maybe a storytime. I remember you used to make a lot of those a few years ago where you would sit and drink tea and just talk about interesting things that are important to you. I don't want you to feel like i'm intruding because it's really not what i'm trying to do. I'm sorry this comment is so long but i hope you take the time to read it and maybe reply? You have no idea how much i would appreciate that. It would mean a lot to me if you wrote what you think about my ideas. I love you Arden, have a good day xx",0,0

I am not a celebrity/musician idol worshiper but I have to give credit where credit is deserved and in my opinion Tom Petty did good... he seemed to be a humble man. I was fortunate to have seen Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers while I was at the ripe old age of 19 on military leave in Pittsburgh back in 1983, what a wonderful birthday gift it was and they sure put on a great concert.",3,0

4WNHB8vROg4,<3 thank you for sharing his last moments on stage with us kim <3 saw Tom Petty at Red Rocks in the Denver area when I barely arrived to work with youth after the tragic shooting at Columbine... what a beautiful outdoor concert venue ...!!! ... what funnn !!! they toss marshmallows at one another in the audience before the concert there !!! 😜it was a gorgeous night ... and I didn’t realize til later who was sitting next to me...a blonde by herself in a floppy hat... a picture... larger than life ...flicking her bic and waving it for Tom... it looked to be Marianne Faithful ..!!! He spotted her and played the entire concert nodding to her...in respect ... 🤗 a sweet gesture ... he wore a long dress coat .. I believe purple... or maybe burgundy... his endless 🎸 🎸 🎸 guitars were displayed all out on stage with him ... beautiful...and he switched guitars with every song ! Now that in itself was cool..!!! The music and his voice were IN-CRED-IBLE !!! I was actually bummed at first because I’d missed Santana just before there but when I heard Tom Petty... it blew it all away !!! I’m glad it was my one and only concert at Red Rocks... and that’s my memory of that beautiful place !!! It was a moment in time stolen where I was brought some joy before going into a very tough situation that would change me forever as a responder at Columbine ... <3 That’s why I’d gone out there from my native NH... the only happy memory I had out there during that very difficult time for so many as my heart broke with theirs... and one of the only fun moments since... as life weighed heavier since... I relived my entire time growing up in NH with Toms music that night ...it truly is the soundtrack of our lives... for we who grew up with Tom Petty’s songs... though he wasn’t that much older... THANK YOU TOM PETTY !!! Wish I’d told you in person ...!!! Telling you now... in my heart and soul and where you are now ...  I know you hear me... and so now you’re free fallin ... and you’re learning to fly ... you never needed wings... your music lifted us with you... in a natural high ... I remember now... whenever Id need to feel free... I’d play free fallin’ in my firebird... later .. 🚙 my jeep wrangler and put the roof down...... and drive... just drive....by the beach along the nh seacoast...and the stress would leave me and I’d be free fallin too. l!!  <3 gone too soon ... 😓... Tom Petty...we hardly knew ye.......  <3,0,0

This was most likely a man who loved a woman who he met in Vegas but had an horrible experience in Veagus and took his anger out on people enjoying their lives there. Its not a race, religion, or culture hate crime. Just a man with depression and resentment, with his way around weapons and ingenuity, doing something horrible out of anger.",0,0

A 64 year-old whom is Blinded by love can develope childish behavior when options are not an option, But what he failed to realize is that gold-diggers are only around as long as the gold, Which I believe is why he gambled the way he did.

They post her picture first before the shooter pics on every possible media sources than the actual shooters. Since, he is a white man. They are trying to find a slithiest wrong doing of her to pin her down.

NMRvbg-denE,"This woman probably did not have anything to do with this horrible crime. However, would any of you want her to be roaming free if she had a real connection to the crime? In the comment section, people  are trying to say that  white people are being racist again  by accusing  this woman of anything when in fact, in an investigation, they are to find out if the people that lived with the killer had any connection or not. Innocent people, young and old, lost their lives with hellfire raining down upon them. If she helped him prepare for this then she must be prosecuted and hopefully executed. If anyone thinks otherwise, you're a pathetic excuse for a human being. She should not be let off without there being a hundred percent confirmation that she's innocent. Do you not want the people responsible for this act to be punished? Are you going to keep throwing the race card at everything like the whiny little bitches you are? There is no argument to be had. If you think it is racist to even question her then you are horribly wrong. She was living with him so she will face questioning to aid in the investigation. I bet if the person was black and the girlfriend was white all of you people complaining would be saying that she should be investigated as well.",0,0

I'm not comparing those to firearms that were used for mass destruction and in no way wish to diminish this tragedy that was very very real.

kWaJCOyORvI,"I vaguely remember seeing this movie on either the Scyfy channel or on VHS when I was young and don't remember what I thought of it...probably bored me to death given the long scenes where nothing happened. Now I think of the overall story as a science fiction take on the question of what is and what is not alive...a question that seems simple enough but when you get down to the actual science of it is far more complex than you would think. \\nI mean, Replicant's are robots, artificial, and thus you wouldn't normally think of them as being alive, except for the fact that they are sentient and self aware to the point that they believe themselves to be alive, fear death and just want to live.\\nThe idea of Deckard being a Replicant himself is definitely a cool part of the story due to how human he seems, which ties into the whole question of what is and is not alive that the story tackles.\\nI once heard someone say that science fiction is an existential metaphor that allows us to tell stories of the human condition. This movie serves as an example of people depicting a story of the philosophy and scientific thought that goes into considering what is truly alive despite its form and origin, which is why it has such a significant impact with science fiction fans.",0,0

4WNHB8vROg4,<3 thank you for sharing his last moments on stage with us kim <3 saw Tom Petty at Red Rocks in the Denver area when I barely arrived to work with youth after the tragic shooting at Columbine... what a beautiful outdoor concert venue ...!!! ... what funnn !!! they toss marshmallows at one another in the audience before the concert there !!! 😜it was a gorgeous night ... and I didn’t realize til later who was sitting next to me...a blonde by herself in a floppy hat... a picture... larger than life ...flicking her bic and waving it for Tom... it looked to be Marianne Faithful ..!!! He spotted her and played the entire concert nodding to her...in respect ... 🤗 a sweet gesture ... he wore a long dress coat .. I believe purple... or maybe burgundy... his endless 🎸 🎸 🎸 guitars were displayed all out on stage with him ... beautiful...and he switched guitars with every song ! Now that in itself was cool..!!! The music and his voice were IN-CRED-IBLE !!! I was actually bummed at first because I’d missed Santana just before there but when I heard Tom Petty... it blew it all away !!! I’m glad it was my one and only concert at Red Rocks... and that’s my memory of that beautiful place !!! It was a moment in time stolen where I was brought some joy before going into a very tough situation that would change me forever as a responder at Columbine ... <3 That’s why I’d gone out there from my native NH... the only happy memory I had out there during that very difficult time for so many as my heart broke with theirs... and one of the only fun moments since... as life weighed heavier since... I relived my entire time growing up in NH with Toms music that night ...it truly is the soundtrack of our lives... for we who grew up with Tom Petty’s songs... though he wasn’t that much older... THANK YOU TOM PETTY !!! Wish I’d told you in person ...!!! Telling you now... in my heart and soul and where you are now ...  I know you hear me... and so now you’re free fallin ... and you’re learning to fly ... you never needed wings... your music lifted us with you... in a natural high ... I remember now... whenever Id need to feel free... I’d play free fallin’ in my firebird... later .. 🚙 my jeep wrangler and put the roof down...... and drive... just drive....by the beach along the nh seacoast...and the stress would leave me and I’d be free fallin too. l!!  <3 gone too soon ... 😓... Tom Petty...we hardly knew ye.......  <3,0,0

This was most likely a man who loved a woman who he met in Vegas but had an horrible experience in Veagus and took his anger out on people enjoying their lives there.

They post her picture first before the shooter pics on every possible media sources than the actual shooters. Since, he is a white man. They are trying to find a slithiest wrong doing of her to pin her down. Rather than admit it that many white man in this country are psychopath individuals that needed to be evaluated in the large scale.

Uw3eeaFT5Rw,I feel you on how it's hard to find foundations to match because I have a really yellow undertone and when I find a great one from the drugstore I think that'll match me it either turns out to be wayyy to pink on me even though it looks yellow tonish. The only one foundation that seems to match me good is milani conceal n perfect in #1 but it feels to heavy on the skin for me so that's why I'm kinda bummed out. Even the maybelline one I cannot find my correct shade 💔💔💔,0,0
Uw3eeaFT5Rw,This is such a great and important video!  I read online that sometimes mom and pop drugstores don’t stock darker shades because they’re afraid that people who use those shades would shoplift.,0,0

Uw3eeaFT5Rw,I feel you on how it's hard to find foundations to match because I have a really yellow undertone and when I find a great one from the drugstore I think that'll match me it either turns out to be wayyy to pink on me even though it looks yellow tonish. The only one foundation that seems to match me good is milani conceal n perfect in #1 but it feels to heavy on the skin for me so that's why I'm kinda bummed out. Even the maybelline one I cannot find my correct shade 💔💔💔,0,0

Uw3eeaFT5Rw,I feel you on how it's hard to find foundations to match because I have a really yellow undertone and when I find a great one from the drugstore I think that'll match me it either turns out to be wayyy to pink on me even though it looks yellow tonish. The only one foundation that seems to match me good is milani conceal n perfect in #1 but it feels to heavy on the skin for me so that's why I'm kinda bummed out. Even the maybelline one I cannot find my correct shade 💔💔💔,0,0

RaKxVWJxA2U,"I suspect Kylo is most likely reaching out to either his mom in the present after her base is destroyed, or to Luke in the past (after destroying his school); not to Rey.\\n\\nMaybe when Luke says: “this isn’t going to go the way you think” he’s either talking to Kylo in the past before he destroys the school, or to Kylo in the present after he comes looking for Rey after Luke sends her away, or even talking to Leia with the force about Kylo; not to Rey.\\n\\nI highly-suspect that Snoke is talking about Rey’s power while ‘training’ her with torture or whatever, and with the “something truly special” he’s recalling the evil she felt when considering killing Kylo in the last movie - a move on the path to the dark side. And “fulfill your destiny” is maybe the disappointment Snoke has that she didn’t kill Kylo then, who was just the bait/decoy, so he’s commanding her to do it now. \\n\\nI then suspect that Rey has a change of heart about Kylo when he starts encouraging her to kill him “kill the past” after their familial relation (and her ‘superior’ bloodline) is revealed...I think Snoke wants to use her unrivaled power as a sith and that’s why he had Kylo kill all the young Jedi and concentrate the force onto her. But, with this imbalance of power, “it isn’t going to go the way Snoke thinks”...maybe she’s so powerful after Leia (and possibly Luke) and other force users ‘die’ that she unwittingly drained the force from all of the remaining ones and hence no more Jedi (or siths)...and then the force finds balance another way, perhaps one we’ve never seen. *excited face*",0,0

eXyHRnDNH64,"I run a Granite worktop fabricating company in the UK. I agree with the statistics as we had a major boom in Granite worktops through the 00’s. The shift in trend, in my opinion, has a number of reasons behind it.\\nFirstly, just as fashion trends can shift, Granite has slowly begun looking outdated. We have seen a marked increase in quartz worktops due to its more practical properties and the wider range of colours available. So much so that it has surpassed Granite in terms of sales.\\n\\nSecondly, due to the uncertainty of the economy at the time, many people were reluctant to sell their property and would opt for injecting a little bit more money into a kitchen project or extension. This resulted in a number of new worktop fabricators starting up, creating a more competitive pricing environment making it more accessible to the middle and lower class markets.\\n\\nA new product recently hit the market as well. Sintered Stone outperforms Granite and quartz in all aspects, including price. But it’s early days for this product and it has yet to gain its market notoriety. And the price also scares people away for the product.\\n\\nHope this didn’t bore you too much. Haha",0,0

RaKxVWJxA2U,"I suspect Kylo is most likely reaching out to either his mom in the present after her base is destroyed, or to Luke in the past (after destroying his school); not to Rey.\\n\\nMaybe when Luke says: “this isn’t going to go the way you think” he’s either talking to Kylo in the past before he destroys the school, or to Kylo in the present after he comes looking for Rey after Luke sends her away, or even talking to Leia with the force about Kylo; not to Rey.\\n\\nI highly-suspect that Snoke is talking about Rey’s power while ‘training’ her with torture or whatever, and with the “something truly special” he’s recalling the evil she felt when considering killing Kylo in the last movie - a move on the path to the dark side. And “fulfill your destiny” is maybe the disappointment Snoke has that she didn’t kill Kylo then, who was just the bait/decoy, so he’s commanding her to do it now. \\n\\nI then suspect that Rey has a change of heart about Kylo when he starts encouraging her to kill him “kill the past” after their familial relation (and her ‘superior’ bloodline) is revealed...I think Snoke wants to use her unrivaled power as a sith and that’s why he had Kylo kill all the young Jedi and concentrate the force onto her. But, with this imbalance of power, “it isn’t going to go the way Snoke thinks”...maybe she’s so powerful after Leia (and possibly Luke) and other force users ‘die’ that she unwittingly drained the force from all of the remaining ones and hence no more Jedi (or siths)...and then the force finds balance another way, perhaps one we’ve never seen. *excited face*",0,0

ktc8XDBq93k,"*We actually improve so many thing about this comeback,  like korean chart, album sales,  yes our youtube views is decreasing compared to NEVER EVER,  but the like and comments is lots,  mean our fandoms is keep bigger,we trending in many country, itunes no1 in 17 country, and many youtube trending,  i think many of ahgases help stream in korea site, that why youtube views not that fast we make it NAVER, MNET, GENIE,  debuted no 1 after mv out,  even soribada and bugs is in top3 position,  our melon chart is good comparing to Never ever,  we get rank no3/4 in ICHART that really huge improvement,  for other ahgases who can't help stream in korea app,  we must hardly stream here,  we expected to win this time but Nuest is really no joke this time,  Nuest got a public recognition after the program produce 101,we do very amazing at album sales and we never expect nuest to sell more album than us, Yes their fans work hard to get NUEST first win, that really shock,  yes they deserved to get that! But our boys is GOT7,  that why we need to help them,  That why if we want to won,  let's work more hard, but if we dont won , don't be so frust,  the boys know how we work,  but yesss whatever let's work hard more for them,  they give everything to us , I tell you ahgases u will only meet group like GOT7 once in your lifes,  i'm not trying to say anything,  but tell me where u can find a group who always put 'BABYBIRD' in their mv, babybird is us!,  where u can find a group who always upload special video in every comeback for us? They humble, funny,crazy, sweet, Where u can find a group that always talk about their friendship than anything? Creating album about real friendship? Including us in their life,  love us than anything, ? , every group have their own uniqueness,  but you will only meet squad like GOT7 once in your life, They never be same and none group can replace them in my heart, like jinyoung said said GOT7 is a friends that i will never meet again in my life,  i will never meet friends like them, only them, we came from differents country , differents age,we work hard together and share the same dreams okay Ahgases no matters what happen, 1,2,3,or 10 years we will stay with them, always GOT7,  7 for life,  although if we lost don't ever stop streaming, voting and all,  our boys only have us,  only IGOT7,  if JYP seems dont care about them anymore let JYP know IGOT7 is work harder than the company,  JYP never promote them in korea popular variety show, Jyp seems to want they work for more tours and etc to get a lots money,  that no fair,  they deserved korea big award too!,  we need to make JYP wake up,  let JYP know our boys talents need more recognition in korea,  let's make JYP send them in happY together,  Knowing bro,  and etc,  so our boys will be more popular in korea, please JYP just dont use GOT7 only for money,  give them what they deserved !*\\n\\n*Sorry for mention nuest,  i like them too*",2,1

RaKxVWJxA2U,"I suspect Kylo is most likely reaching out to either his mom in the present after her base is destroyed, or to Luke in the past (after destroying his school); not to Rey.\\n\\nMaybe when Luke says: “this isn’t going to go the way you think” he’s either talking to Kylo in the past before he destroys the school, or to Kylo in the present after he comes looking for Rey after Luke sends her away, or even talking to Leia with the force about Kylo; not to Rey.\\n\\nI highly-suspect that Snoke is talking about Rey’s power while ‘training’ her with torture or whatever, and with the “something truly special” he’s recalling the evil she felt when considering killing Kylo in the last movie - a move on the path to the dark side. And “fulfill your destiny” is maybe the disappointment Snoke has that she didn’t kill Kylo then, who was just the bait/decoy, so he’s commanding her to do it now. \\n\\nI then suspect that Rey has a change of heart about Kylo when he starts encouraging her to kill him “kill the past” after their familial relation (and her ‘superior’ bloodline) is revealed...I think Snoke wants to use her unrivaled power as a sith and that’s why he had Kylo kill all the young Jedi and concentrate the force onto her. But, with this imbalance of power, “it isn’t going to go the way Snoke thinks”...maybe she’s so powerful after Leia (and possibly Luke) and other force users ‘die’ that she unwittingly drained the force from all of the remaining ones and hence no more Jedi (or siths)...and then the force finds balance another way, perhaps one we’ve never seen. *excited face*",0,0

RaKxVWJxA2U,"I suspect Kylo is most likely reaching out to either his mom in the present after her base is destroyed, or to Luke in the past (after destroying his school); not to Rey.\\n\\nMaybe when Luke says: “this isn’t going to go the way you think” he’s either talking to Kylo in the past before he destroys the school, or to Kylo in the present after he comes looking for Rey after Luke sends her away, or even talking to Leia with the force about Kylo; not to Rey.\\n\\nI highly-suspect that Snoke is talking about Rey’s power while ‘training’ her with torture or whatever, and with the “something truly special” he’s recalling the evil she felt when considering killing Kylo in the last movie - a move on the path to the dark side. And “fulfill your destiny” is maybe the disappointment Snoke has that she didn’t kill Kylo then, who was just the bait/decoy, so he’s commanding her to do it now. \\n\\nI then suspect that Rey has a change of heart about Kylo when he starts encouraging her to kill him “kill the past” after their familial relation (and her ‘superior’ bloodline) is revealed...I think Snoke wants to use her unrivaled power as a sith and that’s why he had Kylo kill all the young Jedi and concentrate the force onto her. But, with this imbalance of power, “it isn’t going to go the way Snoke thinks”...maybe she’s so powerful after Leia (and possibly Luke) and other force users ‘die’ that she unwittingly drained the force from all of the remaining ones and hence no more Jedi (or siths)...and then the force finds balance another way, perhaps one we’ve never seen. *excited face*",0,0

RaKxVWJxA2U,"Holy shit the blatant disconcerting reading-face she's doing is the most distracting thing I've seen in weeks, and the fact that you had to KEEP CUTTING TO HER RANDOMLY forced me to keep most of the video off the screen at all times because seeing her leaning forward staring at the cue cards/prompter made every word she said turn into those sounds adults made on Peanuts cartoons.\\n\\nIf you have to bring someone on that can't read without leaning in and making it obvious, at least don't cut to her at random frequent intervals so it's less of a distraction.",0,0

Xx7sxWI9FNI,"Use ur other hand to wash the rice. To get rid of the starch and you get almost clear water. All the rice in this video was mushy and wet. I do this:\\nOlive oil in the pot until it burns then add rice and stir, until the rice is goldenish and crsipy, but not too much. Lower the heat to low/medium. Then add water or stock and let it cover the rice like 3cm above rice, so u can still see the rice from above add salt and stir and leave it to simmer for 15-25 minutes.\\nCheck on the rice, if you see holes then the water is going away and that is good. So give it a stir to see how much water is left at the bottom and to give you an idea how long to leave it more. Back to simmering, then switch off heat and serve.\\nIf you see there is lots of water there, take the lid off to let the steam goes away. I hope that helps :)",1,0

cCqS5X_zu-g,"From my personal research, this is what I've captured.\\nPaddock was not the shooter and the reason the investigation is neverending, is because they're chasing the wrong guy.\\nA proclaimed LVPD officer on 4chan gave a story that fits much better than the one CNN pulled out of thin air. He said that it was a sting operation gone wrong. Paddock was working with the FBI to sell weapons to terrorists. Paddock was then killed and the terrorists carried out the attack. This would explain the reason for all of the weapons when only a few were used. Paddock also had history working for NASA and Lockheed-Martin; government programs. There's also proof from multiple camera angles of a 4th floor shooter and more than one gun firing from different positions; video and audio evidence. Speaking of audio, the fire rate of the gunfire matches an m240 machine gun perfectly. A full auto m16 fires much faster. I like my points to be backed by evidence and I don't see much evidence in a 60+ y/o elderly man with a clear record carrying out an attack with a machine gun he probably couldn't carry, then taking it to another position to reload quickly and continue. With that said, contact your representative and warn them about H.R.3999. YouTube has some informative videos on that as well.\\nGod bless and keep America strong.",0,0

He died so that you may live! \\n\\nSo please make Jesus your Lord and Savior it you haven't already. He will forgive you, He will redeem you, He will make you new! I have experienced it personally and thank Him for showing me. Hallelujah!\\n\\nJesus does not promise an easy life as a Christian, but the opposite. However He does promise a new home, a new life and a new world in the world to come! No more death and no more tears! Hallelujah!\\n\\nTomorrow is not promised to any of us, so please consider calling upon Him today in sincerity. You will not be disappointed. \\n\\nTo die without Jesus is dangerous.

No problem.\\nThe 28th was supposedly when the reservation was changed to include Danley, or replaced with Danley. I don't know which.\\nIf Paddock was planning on sending her BACK to the Philippines, WHY DID HE NEED TO PUT HER ON THE ROOM REGISTRATION?\\nDo you see that this makes NO SENSE whatsoever?  \\nSo here are the options:\\n1.  Paddock changed it and had no plans to commit any shooting.  Which means he did not bring the guns up to the room or commit the shooting.\\n2.  Paddock changed it and planned to commit the shooting and wanted to implicate her as well, even though he sent $100,000 to her account in the Philippines (absurd)\\n3.  Someone else changed it, and wanted to implicate Danley as well, which means Paddock did not bring the guns to the room   or commit the shooting. (verified conspiracy)\\n4.  Danley changed it with Paddock's permission.  He wanted to have fun with her that weekend, even though he planned to commit a shooting with her in the room.  (absurd)\\n5. Danley changed it without Paddock's permission, brought the guns to his room, committed the shooting to make it look like Paddock did it, then killed him, left town, and stated that Paddock bought her a ticket to leave town. Putting her name on the registration, then saying he was sending her back home, would make it look like she was not implicated.  Or, her conspirators committed the shooting and she assisted.  That said, don't we know that ISIS is operating in the Philippines at this time? Did they not take credit for this heinous act?\\nIs it possible that Ms. Danley is not as innocent as it would seem?\\nPlease note, I am not accusing anybody of anything. This is just an investigative theoretical analysis of possible events.",1,2
cCqS5X_zu-g,Brain abnormalities lol he was just a domestic terrorist.,1,0
cCqS5X_zu-g,"From my personal research, this is what I've captured.\\nPaddock was not the shooter and the reason the investigation is neverending, is because they're chasing the wrong guy.\\nA proclaimed LVPD officer on 4chan gave a story that fits much better than the one CNN pulled out of thin air. He said that it was a sting operation gone wrong. Paddock was working with the FBI to sell weapons to terrorists. Paddock was then killed and the terrorists carried out the attack. This would explain the reason for all of the weapons when only a few were used. Paddock also had history working for NASA and Lockheed-Martin; government programs. There's also proof from multiple camera angles of a 4th floor shooter and more than one gun firing from different positions; video and audio evidence. Speaking of audio, the fire rate of the gunfire matches an m240 machine gun perfectly. A full auto m16 fires much faster. I like my points to be backed by evidence and I don't see much evidence in a 60+ y/o elderly man with a clear record carrying out an attack with a machine gun he probably couldn't carry, then taking it to another position to reload quickly and continue. With that said, contact your representative and warn them about H.R.3999. YouTube has some informative videos on that as well.\\nGod bless and keep America strong.",1,0

Xx7sxWI9FNI,"1) DO NOT add rice before water boils!!!  Boil the rice first, THEN add the rice, turn down to simmer, close the lid.\\n2) Instead of oil, add 1 tbl spoon of unsalted butter with the water.  Once the water boils and the butter is melted, then add the rice.  The rice will absorb the butter, giving it a nice flavor.\\n3) Use bottled or filtered water.  Better water = better rice.\\n4) For GOD sakes, DO NOT use a non-stick pot.  All the chemicals in the non-stick will seep into your food.  Stainless steel works fine.\\n5) If there's any rice stuck or burnt on the bottom of the pot after you cook, the easiest way to get it off is to fill the pot half-way with water, then let it sit over night (lid on).  In the morning, dump the water, skim the bottom of the pot to remove the now loose rice, then clean pot.  \\n\\nYou're welcome.",0,0

Someone else changed it, and wanted to implicate Danley as well, which means Paddock did not bring the guns to the room   or commit the shooting. (verified conspiracy)\\n4.  Danley changed it with Paddock's permission.  He wanted to have fun with her that weekend, even though he planned to commit a shooting with her in the room.  (absurd)\\n5. Danley changed it without Paddock's permission, brought the guns to his room, committed the shooting to make it look like Paddock did it, then killed him, left town, and stated that Paddock bought her a ticket to leave town. Putting her name on the registration, then saying he was sending her back home, would make it look like she was not implicated.  Or, her conspirators committed the shooting and she assisted.  That said, don't we know that ISIS is operating in the Philippines at this time?

cCqS5X_zu-g,"From my personal research, this is what I've captured.\\nPaddock was not the shooter and the reason the investigation is neverending, is because they're chasing the wrong guy.\\nA proclaimed LVPD officer on 4chan gave a story that fits much better than the one CNN pulled out of thin air. He said that it was a sting operation gone wrong. Paddock was working with the FBI to sell weapons to terrorists. Paddock was then killed and the terrorists carried out the attack. This would explain the reason for all of the weapons when only a few were used. Paddock also had history working for NASA and Lockheed-Martin; government programs. There's also proof from multiple camera angles of a 4th floor shooter and more than one gun firing from different positions; video and audio evidence. Speaking of audio, the fire rate of the gunfire matches an m240 machine gun perfectly. A full auto m16 fires much faster. I like my points to be backed by evidence and I don't see much evidence in a 60+ y/o elderly man with a clear record carrying out an attack with a machine gun he probably couldn't carry, then taking it to another position to reload quickly and continue. With that said, contact your representative and warn them about H.R.3999. YouTube has some informative videos on that as well.\\nGod bless and keep America strong.",1,0

Xx7sxWI9FNI,"Okay, here some tips from an Asian:\\n1. Work with 1 rice brand that you think you'll like. This because even its the same long grain bla bla bla, different brands can came from a different variety of rice thus have different characteristics. Even it's the same kind, different brands can ask different ammount of water to cooked perfectly. With working only with one kind of rice, you can learn from trial and error how much water you should put to suit your liking.\\n2. Know your rice characteristic if you have intention to make it into a different meal. Softer rice are good for porridge and make mushy white rice, while the the harder and drier one is good for making fried rice. But again, it depends with your liking (rule number 1 in most Asian kitchen: cook things that you like because you and your family are the one who eat it).\\n3. If you are the more sturdy white rice eater like me and own a rice cooker, cook it with a bit less water than usual. After the switch turned to 'warm' (means the cooking process is done), take a bit of hot water and 'sprinkle' it on top of the rice until it turns a bit wet and push the cooj button again. Reducing the water in the begining will make it less mushy.",0,0

You will see the stuff that is not rice (bugs ect) floating on the water. Rinse and repeat.\\nSecond, don't stir the rice. At least that's how we asians here in asia were taught. \\nSince many don't use their fingers to measure the water, I commend some of the other tips. We also don't add salt. We appreciate rice as it is. Unless it is fried rice.",0,0

Xx7sxWI9FNI,"As a brazilian who cooks/eats long grain white rice every day I think this rice doesn't look perfect. When you are trying to make perfect rice you must know the brand you are using, the ratio of oil to coat all the grains without getting a greasy rice at the end and for how long you must fry the grains. You should also know how to control the heat based on the pan you are using and how to manage the steam in the final part of cooking to get the rice properly cooked without breaking the grains or making it sticky and mushy.",0,0

Xx7sxWI9FNI,"As an Asian who eats rice 3x a day, I can tell you're cooking it with way too much water. Rice is like pasta too--al dente! Rice that's too wet isn't palatable.",0,0
Xx7sxWI9FNI,"1) DO NOT add rice before water boils!!!  Boil the rice first, THEN add the rice, turn down to simmer, close the lid.\\n2) Instead of oil, add 1 tbl spoon of unsalted butter with the water.  Once the water boils and the butter is melted, then add the rice.  The rice will absorb the butter, giving it a nice flavor.\\n3) Use bottled or filtered water.  Better water = better rice.\\n4) For GOD sakes, DO NOT use a non-stick pot.  All the chemicals in the non-stick will seep into your food.  Stainless steel works fine.\\n5) If there's any rice stuck or burnt on the bottom of the pot after you cook, the easiest way to get it off is to fill the pot half-way with water, then let it sit over night (lid on).  In the morning, dump the water, skim the bottom of the pot to remove the now loose rice, then clean pot.  \\n\\nYou're welcome.",0,0

cCqS5X_zu-g,"From my personal research, this is what I've captured.\\nPaddock was not the shooter and the reason the investigation is neverending, is because they're chasing the wrong guy.\\nA proclaimed LVPD officer on 4chan gave a story that fits much better than the one CNN pulled out of thin air. He said that it was a sting operation gone wrong. Paddock was working with the FBI to sell weapons to terrorists. Paddock was then killed and the terrorists carried out the attack. This would explain the reason for all of the weapons when only a few were used. Paddock also had history working for NASA and Lockheed-Martin; government programs. There's also proof from multiple camera angles of a 4th floor shooter and more than one gun firing from different positions; video and audio evidence. Speaking of audio, the fire rate of the gunfire matches an m240 machine gun perfectly. A full auto m16 fires much faster. I like my points to be backed by evidence and I don't see much evidence in a 60+ y/o elderly man with a clear record carrying out an attack with a machine gun he probably couldn't carry, then taking it to another position to reload quickly and continue. With that said, contact your representative and warn them about H.R.3999. YouTube has some informative videos on that as well.\\nGod bless and keep America strong.",1,0

Fuck modern phones, one generation back is fine by me.\\n\\nI mean, the current generation of the newest phones is truly fucked up, with nothing new that is worth mentioning. Apple comes out with a phone that has new features that were introduced on the android platform years ago and presenting it as if they are the first and unbelievably innovative (unbelievably because it's a fucking lie) which is immediately made obsolete by a phone that, again, has just a bigger screen and a slightly faster chip and better camera with features taken away to be innovative while inconveniencing  the user with features that nobody ever asked for (where is that fucking better battery? You could have seriously put an iphone 7 mobo in an iphone 6 body, with headphone jack, and a big battery upgrade, and your followers would have eaten that shit like it was fucking sugar).\\n\\nAnd google came into the market with their first phone, made it nearly impossible to pay for it was that expensive, and now they just put 2 after the name, did a small upgrade of internals and are going to sell the thing for, again a stupendous amount of money.

I am thoroughly displeased by this turn of development, not sure if you can call a sorta downgrade a development... sure the audio might be better in some cases, but using the excuse that it's for waterproofing is dumb, since the USB port is still open to the water and would short out the same way as a headphone-jack unless you do some clever stuff on the inside to make the device only put low enough charge through the port until it detects a valid load. And what is up with developers putting the headphone-jack on the bottom all the time if they have one these days? I don't like it. Then again I haven't changed device since the note 3 (although I'm getting close to having to), oh well, keep up the good work guys, I'm sorry I seldom find myself engaged enough to like/dislike or comment, it's not you, you are great, I'm just very bad at social things.

CN4YL1KPDAA,"I think part of the problem y'all have been having is that you're getting so caught up in the process of making quality videos you're forgetting what made your channel popular to begin with. Yes, the quality of the video and audio has gotten objectively better, and yes the editing is much better and more refined. However, that's not what most watched you for. We liked the down to earth feel of the channel. This goes right back to that with you talking to Brandon and doing an off the cuff unboxing. I still enjoy some of your newer content, but honestly you might want to consider adding some segments like this. It would cut down on your editing workflow and let you produce videos with less overhead, and still please your fans. There is definitely a call for some of your newer video segments and the newer editing style, but I think if you mix the new and old a bit you'd see some renewed interest in the channel. That's just my thoughts so take it with a grain of salt.",1,1
CN4YL1KPDAA,That's not a jenki solution... and you still have to unplug the headphone jack from one to the other. You should take the two adaptors and splice one into the other. That way you'd have both lightening and usb c adaptors on the end of one headphone jack cable. You're welcome.,0,1

Use enough water to cover the firrst joint on your middle finger in the pan, while you place the finger on top of the rice.

Xx7sxWI9FNI,"As a brazilian who cooks/eats long grain white rice every day I think this rice doesn't look perfect. When you are trying to make perfect rice you must know the brand you are using, the ratio of oil to coat all the grains without getting a greasy rice at the end and for how long you must fry the grains. You should also know how to control the heat based on the pan you are using and how to manage the steam in the final part of cooking to get the rice properly cooked without breaking the grains or making it sticky and mushy.",0,0

You will see the stuff that is not rice (bugs ect) floating on the water. Rinse and repeat.\\nSecond, don't stir the rice. At least that's how we asians here in asia were taught. \\nSince many don't use their fingers to measure the water, I commend some of the other tips. We also don't add salt. We appreciate rice as it is. Unless it is fried rice.",0,0

Xx7sxWI9FNI,"1) DO NOT add rice before water boils!!!  Boil the rice first, THEN add the rice, turn down to simmer, close the lid.\\n2) Instead of oil, add 1 tbl spoon of unsalted butter with the water.  Once the water boils and the butter is melted, then add the rice.  The rice will absorb the butter, giving it a nice flavor.\\n3) Use bottled or filtered water.  Better water = better rice.\\n4) For GOD sakes, DO NOT use a non-stick pot.  All the chemicals in the non-stick will seep into your food.  Stainless steel works fine.\\n5) If there's any rice stuck or burnt on the bottom of the pot after you cook, the easiest way to get it off is to fill the pot half-way with water, then let it sit over night (lid on).  In the morning, dump the water, skim the bottom of the pot to remove the now loose rice, then clean pot.  \\n\\nYou're welcome.",0,0

Certainly not fluffy and certainly not a great consistency.  Could not be cooked worse if she tried.  And the rice she's stirring at 1:58 doesn't look any better.  Nor does the rice she's serving at 2:09.  Should this chick be giving advice on how to cook rice?",0,0
Xx7sxWI9FNI,"Okay, here some tips from an Asian:\\n1. Work with 1 rice brand that you think you'll like. This because even its the same long grain bla bla bla, different brands can came from a different variety of rice thus have different characteristics. Even it's the same kind, different brands can ask different ammount of water to cooked perfectly. With working only with one kind of rice, you can learn from trial and error how much water you should put to suit your liking.\\n2. Know your rice characteristic if you have intention to make it into a different meal. Softer rice are good for porridge and make mushy white rice, while the the harder and drier one is good for making fried rice. But again, it depends with your liking (rule number 1 in most Asian kitchen: cook things that you like because you and your family are the one who eat it).\\n3. If you are the more sturdy white rice eater like me and own a rice cooker, cook it with a bit less water than usual. After the switch turned to 'warm' (means the cooking process is done), take a bit of hot water and 'sprinkle' it on top of the rice until it turns a bit wet and push the cooj button again. Reducing the water in the begining will make it less mushy.",0,0

I don't want a fucking phone that needs to have bluetooth enabled during the day just t listen to music (and yes i listen to music the entire day) so my battery is almost certain to be empty before noon. Fuck modern phones, one generation back is fine by me.\\n\\nI mean, the current generation of the newest phones is truly fucked up, with nothing new that is worth mentioning. Apple comes out with a phone that has new features that were introduced on the android platform years ago and presenting it as if they are the first and unbelievably innovative (unbelievably because it's a fucking lie) which is immediately made obsolete by a phone that, again, has just a bigger screen and a slightly faster chip and better camera with features taken away to be innovative while inconveniencing  the user with features that nobody ever asked for (where is that fucking better battery? You could have seriously put an iphone 7 mobo in an iphone 6 body, with headphone jack, and a big battery upgrade, and your followers would have eaten that shit like it was fucking sugar).\\n\\nAnd google came into the market with their first phone, made it nearly impossible to pay for it was that expensive, and now they just put 2 after the name, did a small upgrade of internals and are going to sell the thing for, again a stupendous amount of money. Seriously, when you pay 1000$ for a fucking phone, you are mentally retarded. And now with the amazing feature of no headphone jack. Again, useless.",0,0

CN4YL1KPDAA,"I think part of the problem y'all have been having is that you're getting so caught up in the process of making quality videos you're forgetting what made your channel popular to begin with. Yes, the quality of the video and audio has gotten objectively better, and yes the editing is much better and more refined. However, that's not what most watched you for. We liked the down to earth feel of the channel. This goes right back to that with you talking to Brandon and doing an off the cuff unboxing. I still enjoy some of your newer content, but honestly you might want to consider adding some segments like this. It would cut down on your editing workflow and let you produce videos with less overhead, and still please your fans. There is definitely a call for some of your newer video segments and the newer editing style, but I think if you mix the new and old a bit you'd see some renewed interest in the channel. That's just my thoughts so take it with a grain of salt.",1,1

Xx7sxWI9FNI,"The late Cajun cook, Justin Wilson had the best method for cooking rice.  Use enough water to cover the firrst joint on your middle finger in the pan, while you place the finger on top of the rice. Use med- high heat until the water boils OUT, then turn it down low, cover and simmer.  You won't burn a darn thing that way...and it comes out perfect.",0,0

Certainly not fluffy and certainly not a great consistency.  Could not be cooked worse if she tried.  And the rice she's stirring at 1:58 doesn't look any better.  Nor does the rice she's serving at 2:09.  Should this chick be giving advice on how to cook rice?",0,0
Xx7sxWI9FNI,"Okay, here some tips from an Asian:\\n1. Work with 1 rice brand that you think you'll like. This because even its the same long grain bla bla bla, different brands can came from a different variety of rice thus have different characteristics. Even it's the same kind, different brands can ask different ammount of water to cooked perfectly. With working only with one kind of rice, you can learn from trial and error how much water you should put to suit your liking.\\n2. Know your rice characteristic if you have intention to make it into a different meal. Softer rice are good for porridge and make mushy white rice, while the the harder and drier one is good for making fried rice. But again, it depends with your liking (rule number 1 in most Asian kitchen: cook things that you like because you and your family are the one who eat it).\\n3. If you are the more sturdy white rice eater like me and own a rice cooker, cook it with a bit less water than usual. After the switch turned to 'warm' (means the cooking process is done), take a bit of hot water and 'sprinkle' it on top of the rice until it turns a bit wet and push the cooj button again. Reducing the water in the begining will make it less mushy.",0,0

Xx7sxWI9FNI,"Cringe. Who taught this to you girl?\\nFirst off. That is not how you wash rice. Wash the rice in a bowl and massage it until the water becomes white-ish in color. You will see the stuff that is not rice (bugs ect) floating on the water. Rinse and repeat.\\nSecond, don't stir the rice. At least that's how we asians here in asia were taught. \\nSince many don't use their fingers to measure the water, I commend some of the other tips. We also don't add salt. We appreciate rice as it is. Unless it is fried rice.",0,0

Xx7sxWI9FNI,"As a brazilian who cooks/eats long grain white rice every day I think this rice doesn't look perfect. When you are trying to make perfect rice you must know the brand you are using, the ratio of oil to coat all the grains without getting a greasy rice at the end and for how long you must fry the grains. You should also know how to control the heat based on the pan you are using and how to manage the steam in the final part of cooking to get the rice properly cooked without breaking the grains or making it sticky and mushy.",0,0

A missed facemask received by Tyreek Hill, which would have moved us into field goal range.  A BS personal foul when Peters hit Carr who was a runner, not a quarterback.  So much BS.

CN4YL1KPDAA,"Why are these dickhead companies coming up with ways to really take away features while charging more? I don't want a fucking phone that needs to have bluetooth enabled during the day just t listen to music (and yes i listen to music the entire day) so my battery is almost certain to be empty before noon. Fuck modern phones, one generation back is fine by me.\\n\\nI mean, the current generation of the newest phones is truly fucked up, with nothing new that is worth mentioning. Apple comes out with a phone that has new features that were introduced on the android platform years ago and presenting it as if they are the first and unbelievably innovative (unbelievably because it's a fucking lie) which is immediately made obsolete by a phone that, again, has just a bigger screen and a slightly faster chip and better camera with features taken away to be innovative while inconveniencing  the user with features that nobody ever asked for (where is that fucking better battery? You could have seriously put an iphone 7 mobo in an iphone 6 body, with headphone jack, and a big battery upgrade, and your followers would have eaten that shit like it was fucking sugar).\\n\\nAnd google came into the market with their first phone, made it nearly impossible to pay for it was that expensive, and now they just put 2 after the name, did a small upgrade of internals and are going to sell the thing for, again a stupendous amount of money. Seriously, when you pay 1000$ for a fucking phone, you are mentally retarded. And now with the amazing feature of no headphone jack. Again, useless.",0,0

CN4YL1KPDAA,"I think part of the problem y'all have been having is that you're getting so caught up in the process of making quality videos you're forgetting what made your channel popular to begin with. Yes, the quality of the video and audio has gotten objectively better, and yes the editing is much better and more refined. However, that's not what most watched you for. We liked the down to earth feel of the channel. This goes right back to that with you talking to Brandon and doing an off the cuff unboxing. I still enjoy some of your newer content, but honestly you might want to consider adding some segments like this. It would cut down on your editing workflow and let you produce videos with less overhead, and still please your fans. There is definitely a call for some of your newer video segments and the newer editing style, but I think if you mix the new and old a bit you'd see some renewed interest in the channel. That's just my thoughts so take it with a grain of salt.",1,1
