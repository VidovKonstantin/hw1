cLdxuaxaQwc,Love you Pewdiepie don't apologize your fine,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,"I am seeing so much idiocy and lack of self awareness in these comments. Let me hit you all with some knowledge: the N word is not okay to say because it has body counts and a huge amount of human suffering attached to it. The word goes back to slave owning days, same as the N word with no hard r. Black folks can say the word because it is theirs to reclaim. I'm a person of color and that word is not in my vocabulary. Why? Because I'm not black, and I'm aware of the oppression tied to this word. I'm also not a piss baby arguing why I should be able to use such a gross word because again, this word is not mine to reclaim. So yeah, it's fine when all these black rappers use the word because it's a part of their personal history. As a grown ass woman I am still in disbelief that people can't have a pinch of empathy for their fellow human beings. If you're not black, you are irrelevant in the conversation of whether you can say the n word. You can't, bottom line, and if you're still arguing your right to say it, well then I have news for you: you're a racist.",0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,Pewds we are all behind you. This is just another attack on your character. We love you,0,0

cLdxuaxaQwc,"dont be sorry pewds, EVERYBODY says something  bad everyday, but your a public person and says this ONE time and get fukin news all over the world talking about it.. jeeezyys, keep on doing what your doing niggah",0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,Other streamers do the same thing and don't apologize. Here is a prime example of a truly moral person he tries so hard even censors himself to try and be a good example but he makes one tiny mistake and they attack him.  I saw an example where a teachers writes the time tables for 9 he starts by writing 9x1=10 then writes the rest right. The kids make fun because he got one wrong but fail to acknowledge that the rest are correct it goes to show people will quickly make fun of your mistakes but ignore your accomplishments. Keep doing what you're doing pewds you truly are an inspiration,0,0

Our ancestors paid for that word with their own blood, so poc today can use it how ever we want. You cannot tell us how we should feel. Y'all are disgusting for backing up your problematic fave and I'm pretty sure he did this before. Pewdiepie is canceled.",0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,And this could in all honestly become a good thing for you. You sit on a platform where you could really educate people especially when so many of your fans seem to think it's okay to be said. Really learn about the history of the word and come back to us if you can because you could really help educate people and that's powerful.,1,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,What the hell is wrong with everyone who's talking badly about him he said the word by accident it's ok pewdiepie you're super cool we all love you the people who are here and supporting youüòä‚ù§Ô∏è,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,"OK guys i get that the word was once used as a demeaning term and that the history of that word will never change, yes pewds fucked up but still it quite obviously wasn't his intention to use the word in a racist way. And those people overreacting are making it easier for toxic media influencers  to fuck every single content creator because they are blowing this out of proportion, pewds is not a racist.",0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,pewdiepie had nothing to be sorry about.  everybody who is mad at him need to get their head out of their ass and get over themselves.  or maybe when a black person makes an offensive remark about a white person i should call them racist and see how they like it.  turn about is fair play.,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,I think other YouTube's who are hatting at him are just jealous that he is bigger than them. I think yes it was wronge for him to say it but common give this guy a break ok I have heard this word said by black people daily if they can say it why can't white people why so sensitive. I am Indian and have heard Sooo much rasisum from every body including black and white people. This is outrageous I am pissed and not happy u can clearly see he was hyped up at the time when he said this can't u actually just support him and understand that he is a human as well,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,"Oh no you're famous so theyre take this outta proportion, keemstar and idubbz didnt get attacked by media just because theyre smaller",0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,Y'all will forgive him for anything lol,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,i think its funny how he said one word and all of the sudden its the end of the world i get it words hurt but you all need to grow up honestly because i can say this the fact that you get offended by a word is dissapointing like seriously theres so much worse one youtube but no one does anything about that grow up!! and at least he had the decency to own up to what you did he said this to everyone in the entire world lets you get on camara and apologize infront of millions of people i bet you cant do it..,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,"I am not angry at you at all.  And you shouldn't have to apologize.  The way I see it, if it's such a bad word then NO ONE should be using it.  Not just white people.  I support you Pewds!",0,0

cLdxuaxaQwc,I like how when other people say these things its fine but when a famous person says this everyone loses their heads,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,People mad because he said the n word!? He said it by accident cause everyone does it,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,"Its just a word, calm down",0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,"lets be honest here guys, we all have let the word slip before... cmon now lol, we are confronted with the word on tv, music, shows, friends, cmon now we have all let it slip atleast once....  lets not front",0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,To the people saying that since black people say it why does it matter if another race says it this is one of many reasons why our society is shit now. It doesn't matter if black says it that doesn't justify other groups using the term shit like that doesn't just slip out that's the worst word you can think of ? It's scary how dumb a lot of people are in these comments we've got a lot of work to do America. Some of your reasoning validation his reasoning for using the word is ridiculous. #SMD,0,0

cLdxuaxaQwc,"Listen listen, it's not up to white people to judge or criticize you for what you said, the word you said it's a offensive slang to black people if anyone has the right to be offended is them. So, please , people on the comments, stop saying it's just a word or I feel offended for them . Let them say what they think about what happened.",0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,What did he say??,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,"Honestly, who is not racist (in their own way) nowadays? Even ppl make jokes of asian having small eyes ...it's common and no it doesnt affect me LOL PLUS HE DIDNT SAY IT OWN PURPOSE ! IF HE REALLY MEANT IT, WHY WOULD HE SAY SORRY :/",0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,If your not black you have no right to say that word point blank period,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,I'm white ok I don't know if it really is offensive at all. BUT HOW THE FUCK DOES HIM SAYING THIS AFFECT YOU AT ALL. He didn't say anything about someone trying to be mean to them. Y'all need to chill.,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,Sticks and Stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,Don't apologize. Political correctness is the newspeak word for leftist censorship.  All these media outlets just trying to bring you down solely because you seem to be somewhat right winged. The fucking Wall Street Journal tried the same thing few months ago and they failed lmao,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,I forgive you but man i can you blame people for saying the n word we say it ourselves,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,Social justice warriors need to chill,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,"As a Black American, I don't think it's that big of a deal. I haven't even seen the clip but from what I've heard and from what I know about Pewds from watching him for years, I can conclude it wasn't meant to be offensive. Lots of the time the word is used now (or its variants), it's not meant to be racist or worth getting offended over. Although, I don't get why people have this weird obsession with saying it. While context does matter, regardless, it's a word with a shitty history and unnecessary to use. When people have a fixation with the word it weirds me out and makes me think they're closet racists. Do people think it's edgy or something? (I'm talking primarily about nigger, not nigga because that word has a totally different connotation)",0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,Saying Nigga isn't even bad it's only bad if you say it in a hateful way to black people ALL THE CRY BABIES and immature people stop going at him I guarantee youse you wouldn't say it to idubbz or others but because it's pewdiepie you think you have the right to go full force at him Yet I can see were people are coming from because pewdiepie did start the biggest ad crisis on any platform ever he has to much pressure on  him that's my speech down üòÇüòÇ btw I do like idubbz it was just an example,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,"say the N word is not alright at all, but people are overreacting waaaaay too much",0,0

cLdxuaxaQwc,"Poods, irrespective of your intentions (which I genuinely believe are pure and not hateful), you are a public face and voice and what you say and do influences others greatly. It's really disappointing to see that you still struggle to really respect the influence you have on YouTube and to your 57 million audience.

cLdxuaxaQwc,"Hi Felix. As an newly subscriber and a fan, I didn't see the bit your apologizing for on your channel but heard the douchebag Sargon of Akkad (not a fan) mentioned it on his channel, where he's clearly stating that it's more then ok to use that particular word if one is not a racist and actually said it multiple times. You clarly have more integrity and a higher moral character then he has and as a Albanien-Swed, am verry proud of you for apologizing. Big UP Brah!",0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,Ive said some hateful shit while playing video games and i tend to rage to and in that rage i probably shouldn't have said some stuff that i did but idgaf,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,"I defended pewds the last racist thing he did. Pewds isn't racist, that's just his inappropriate, dark humor. There's no need to be sensitive, but if you're accidentally racist on several occasions it's not an accident and you're actually racist. I've never ever said the n word, because from a white person that's a terribly hurtful word, and with the black family members that I have, I would never want my young cousins to hear the word that came out of this mans mouth, especially since he's an influencer. Now I'm going to be hearing it more, and then hear well pewdiepie said it, so can I. It's not okay, and it's not something you say in the heat of the moment, it only slips out if you frequently say it. I think I gotta give up on defending this. I've been subscribed for like 6 years. And it's time to say farewell.",0,0

I believe the resentment lies in the fact that you have been rebutting claims of racial bigotry for some time now & your use of the word, more importantly, the context in which it was used, has legitimized said allegations & has discredited your defense in the entire situation.

cLdxuaxaQwc,"Jim Crow laws were state and local laws that enforced racial segregation in the Southern United States. Enacted by white Democratic-dominated state legislatures in the late 19th century after the Reconstruction period, these laws continued to be enforced until 1965. They mandated de jure racial segregation in all public facilities in the states of the former Confederate States of America, starting in 1896 with a separate but equal status for African Americans in railroad cars. Public education had essentially been segregated since its establishment in most of the South after the Civil War. This principle was extended to public facilities and transportation, including segregated cars on interstate trains and, later, buses. Facilities for African Americans were consistently inferior and underfunded compared to those which were then available to European Americans; sometimes they did not exist at all. This body of law institutionalized a number of economic, educational, and social disadvantages. De jure segregation existed mainly in the Southern states, while Northern segregation was generally de facto‚Äîpatterns of housing segregation enforced by private covenants, bank lending practices, and job discrimination, including discriminatory labor union practices. Jim Crow was a pejorative expression meaning Negro.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJim Crow laws‚Äîsometimes, as in Florida, part of state constitutions‚Äîmandated the segregation of public schools, public places, and public transportation, and the segregation of restrooms, restaurants, and drinking fountains for whites and blacks. The U.S. military was already segregated. President Woodrow Wilson, a Southerner, initiated segregation of federal workplaces at the request of southern Cabinet members in 1913.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese Jim Crow laws revived principles of the 1865 and 1866 Black Codes, which had previously restricted the civil rights and civil liberties of African Americans. Segregation of public (state-sponsored) schools was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of the United States in 1954 in Brown v. Board of Education. In some states it took years to implement this decision. Generally, the remaining Jim Crow laws were overruled by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but years of action and court challenges have been needed to unravel the many means of institutional discrimination.",0,0

cLdxuaxaQwc,"I do not understand why everyone is freaking out. He clearly didn't want to offend anyone. The more people have to think about the words they cannot say the bigger the chance is that the word will sometimes slip out.  People that use social media constantly have to tkink about what are they going to say so they don't offend anyone, but no matter what someone will always get offended. I do not completely understand the meaning of N word, and thats because I live in a country where there wasn't slavery and we only have a few black people here, and the same thing is with Sweeden. That doesn't mean we are racist, I see black people equal to white, and I think they sould be proud to be black. In countrys where black people arent common people tend to say N word not to offend someone but because they hear it on the media and they do not understand the real meaning of it. People nowdays are just looking for another reason to ruin PewDiePie, because he has come a long way, he became huge and I am so proud of him, but a lot of people are just jelaous. Leave him alone.

If we treat this word like it's the most evil scary taboo in the world, all that does is gives that word power to the people who do want to be assholes and use it maliciously. \\n\\nAlso, I think we can all agree the word has evolved since the 1940's. It's used so much on tv, in movies, in songs etc. It's a completely different slang pop-culture reference than what it originated as.\\n\\n2.) An apology will get you nowhere. People who may be offended will never be satisfied with an apology. They will not stop until they take you down because you are a big voice they cannot control.

But when celebrities and YouTubers accidentally slip a word too vulgar, suddenly, everyone believes that they are fake and deserve the animosity. This is very hypocritical, and unless you stubbornly refuse that you never made a mistake in your whole life, then you are not in the right to call Felix out for this.

cLdxuaxaQwc,"I do not understand why everyone is freaking out. He clearly didn't want to offend anyone. The more people have to think about the words they cannot say the bigger the chance is that the word will sometimes slip out.  People that use social media constantly have to tkink about what are they going to say so they don't offend anyone, but no matter what someone will always get offended. I do not completely understand the meaning of N word, and thats because I live in a country where there wasn't slavery and we only have a few black people here, and the same thing is with Sweeden. That doesn't mean we are racist, I see black people equal to white, and I think they sould be proud to be black. In countrys where black people arent common people tend to say N word not to offend someone but because they hear it on the media and they do not understand the real meaning of it. People nowdays are just looking for another reason to ruin PewDiePie, because he has come a long way, he became huge and I am so proud of him, but a lot of people are just jelaous. Leave him alone.

cLdxuaxaQwc,"PewDiePie, In america a lot Black people say things so much worse against Whites, Hispanics, Asians and other races.  And when a black person says it I don't see all the hypocritical black people coming out and criticizing them.  What you said was out of you not knowing its an offensive word for blacks, you apologized, now we should move on.  But some black people in America have said words knowing its bad against other races and laugh about it, offer no apology and say something ignorant like if the shoe fits, wear it, than laugh it off saying it was only a joke.  The hypocrisy of black folks in America these days is getting out of control.  Anyways, people should know.",0,0

cLdxuaxaQwc,Y'all gotta understand. I bet you that all of you have said a slur that is intensely offensive in your life.

cLdxuaxaQwc,Everyone has said something racist out loud or to themselves quietly.

People just say it without thinking. Whatever.,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,He is owning up to what he did and has admitted he was in the wrong why can't people who are being mean and stating that he is still in the wrong see that? Like others have said he at least apologized and has owned up to what he said. Give it a rest and leave him be plus there are worse people out there to hate and everyone's slipped up on a lot of things so quit throwing your hate at him before looking in a mirror. I myself am happy and proud he owned up to it. Good for you PewDiePie :) still a fan of your channel and love your videos! =^w^= \n\nP.S.   anyone who comments being mean to my comment please hold your tongue because I won't even respond to ignorant people who can't get over something someone has apologized and has literally made it public too....that is all bye bye :3,0,0

cLdxuaxaQwc,"You don't need to apologize. \\n\\n1.) If we treat this word like it's the most evil scary taboo in the world, all that does is gives that word power to the people who do want to be assholes and use it maliciously. \\n\\nAlso, I think we can all agree the word has evolved since the 1940's. It's used so much on tv, in movies, in songs etc. It's a completely different slang pop-culture reference than what it originated as.\\n\\n2.) An apology will get you nowhere. People who may be offended will never be satisfied with an apology. They will not stop until they take you down because you are a big voice they cannot control. Cultural Marxists control everything we see on TV, and it kills them that everyday ordinary people can broadcast their message directly to the masses. They're threatened by you big time. Fuck them!

cLdxuaxaQwc,people in the comments are grouping themselves into racial categories and act like they're talking on behalf of their race or whatever... it pisses me off because we're all fucking human neither one of us is actually different from the other.

cLdxuaxaQwc,"People make mistakes. It's inevitable, but we constantly make these mistakes in our daily lives, and this condition is called being human. However, many commenters are contradicting themselves. If I made a bet with everyone in this comment section and claimed that you all did something in the past that you regret,  I would be rich. But when celebrities and YouTubers accidentally slip a word too vulgar, suddenly, everyone believes that they are fake and deserve the animosity. This is very hypocritical, and unless you stubbornly refuse that you never made a mistake in your whole life, then you are not in the right to call Felix out for this. People recover from their mistakes and learn to avoid doing them again, and Felix is delivering this in the form of an apology. You all need to learn on how to forgive and forget.",1,0

cLdxuaxaQwc,This was super mature. And honestly it's not a huge deal. Most people have said it anyway and the only reason you're getting shit for it is bc you're YouTube famous. Many others feel the same way and we'll get over it. Making an apology video was the right thing to do.,0,0

cLdxuaxaQwc,"From a Turkish point of view ( I don't consider myself as white nor black nor asian) I think this kind of slippages of the n word are caused by the pop culture like we hear the n word in the music, movies, tv series all the time because black people say it a lot. So we get to use to that word and sometimes with complete innocence people might slip it from their mouth. Because it takes place in our subconscious minds and sometimes it just slips out in the heat of situation. Now  ofcourse I exclude the ones who say it like they mean it. It still doesn't justify the saying the n word. No one should say that. But I just wanted to say these kind of people like pewdiepie didn't realy mean it. He shouldn't have said it but he didn't mean it",0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,everyone in the world has said that word at least once so stop hating on him you hypocrites,0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,He was trying to swear but ended up using an insult. Imagine being a young follower of Felix and being black and you hear him say this. It is super offensive. I'm not trying to send him to the purgatory but says a lot about what his subconscious mind thinks it's a valid insult. These things come from social context so it's not only his fault.  I'm sure that deep down he is not racist but shows it tells that we still have a long way to go in our evolution of how we treat one another.,0,0

We recently had a KKK march in my city. The N word was used A LOT to tell us we are monkeys. Telling us how we are dirty, lazy and scum. I went to Mississippi when I was 10  and I'll never forget when a racist grown man pushed me!. My friends' cousin went to Alexandria (an extremely racist town) and they found him hung by some fishing poles around 5 years ago.  Please just don't say it anymore because the south is already surrounded by racist idiots and I come to the internet and I can't escape racism. It. when people like you use it, even more, people may think it's okay. When someone like you that I somewhat admire uses it. it kind of hurt my feelings at the time. That word is so hurtful because people call me that ALL the time everywhere on the internet. Idk if I will ever be able to escape racism on the internet.  That word was used to demean people. I feel in my heart PewdiePie isn't racist but I think you should research that word lol. I can't explain how hurtful it is. I feel when you said it you didn't say it with malice. I think you thought it was funny.  I understand you being from a different place and environment that I live that you wouldn't understand how big of a deal it is.

-Ifnaxi2LQg,"Sorry, I don't like it. What follows this statement is my opinion.\\n \\n Visually, the video is good but everything else is not meshing well. While Nicki Minaj is an incredible and amazing artist that I DO enjoy, it kind of seems like she was a last minute add-on to try and save this hot mess of a song. Fergie's vocals are ok but ugh, the high pitched This is how we do is annoying. She's much more talented than this.  Lyrically, meh, not impressed. Then we come to the sampling. It's so mismatched and doesn't fit well together. There is no harmony between the two. Music should be flowing regardless of genre and this one doesn't. At least not for me.  All in all, I'd rather not listen to it again and even change the station to avoid doing so. By the way, I love me some Fergie Ferg but this just makes me want to stab a freshly sharpened pencil in both my ears. \\n\\nSo let the hate and insults begin because I disagree with the rest of the class.",0,0

cLdxuaxaQwc,Accidents happen it's the sad truth that the word is even in our heads to be accidentally used it's surprising people don't accidentally say it more often especially because he was pissed everyone's had that time in gaming where this happens you get so pissed off in you say the first thing that comes to mind bad luck that it was the N word but with the fact that he is sincere in his apology and he realizes that he f***** up cut him some damn Slack love you peweds,0,0

cLdxuaxaQwc,"I actually really respect his reaction to what happened. I think it's gotten out of control seeing as, in comparison, many others on Youtube say so much worse. I''m not saying that excuses the behavior at all, but that if you're going to hold one person accountable and make such a big deal about it, you should do the same for others. What he said was wrong, and he obviously regrets it and wasn't thinking when it happened. Good job, Pewds for being honest and acknowledging it!",0,0

He's passing it off as a slip up and that its because he hears other players use it. I agree its not okay and that he should do better for his audience because he's sort of again lost me as a subscriber until he MAJORLY cleans up his act.... I'm really really disappointed...

cLdxuaxaQwc,"It was a mistake and yes you've made some before. But I'm a pretty hard liberal and idgaf. Felix, you spread such a positive message all the time, you reach out and do real, honest, and heartfelt commentary on the state of society and politics, etc. You're always gentle and reaching out to fans and spreading a message of support and love. So you make stupid mistakes sometimes, nobody's perfect. And everybody that is getting so upset about a word... Of course it's a word with a lot of serious negative meaning behind it, but the positive that you give out SOOO outweighs the dumb mistakes. The fact that you apologize so genuinely afterwards just proves all these idiots that say you don't care and that you're full of yourself wrong. You're a wonderful person and you need to just keep doing what you're doing, spread positivity, be true to yourself, and have fun. We love you, Felix. <3",0,0

cLdxuaxaQwc,"Didn't expect him to apologize, I guess losing his channel network, losing his priority on google and YouTube searches, having his show cancelled and helping cause the big advertisers to pull out, thus losing money and not being YouTue's golden boy god anymore has taught you that sometimes you need to own your mistakes after all.

cLdxuaxaQwc,"I stopped watching PewDiePie years ago because of his language, but frankly, being one of the most popular channels on YouTube took a lot of time and effort for him.\\nThe fact that media, his haters, and every other idiot who wants to bring him down makes me disappointed in humans.\\nHas anyone ever took the time to even CONSIDER how many OTHER PEOPLE have said that ONE WORD in their videos, and how they get NO complaints?!\\nHe made one mistake people, but there are worse words in the world.

cLdxuaxaQwc,"Let me break this down for all of you. I make a fair amount of points here that may change your opinion on the matter if you care to be open minded.\\n\\nWhen you play video games you come to realize there is a certain lexicon specifically associated with immature angry children. They say the most disgusting hurtful things to each other through comms and text chats because they have a certain level of anonymity that allows them to feel safe; as if they aren't really hurting anyone. Because it's just online or it's just a video game. Some of them even say those nasty things in their daily lives. Pewdiepie as a gamer on the internet and as a person that produces primarily gaming related content is subjected to this on a daily basis. There are a lot of angsty, edgy, confused, hormonal and sometimes sadistic teenagers in the world, and a great majority of them play video games because it has become somewhat of a past time in this modern age. Such is the case that when you are forced to be around these types of people; their grammar, accents, vocabulary etc, it all begins to rub off on you. (just like in any other aspect of life) Everyone is a product of their surroundings in a sense. You speak the way you do and use the words that you do because of the people you are predisposed to and the media you interact with. If you're surrounded by people on a daily basis that call you (context) nigger while attempting to enrage you or while you're already enraged.. just like any other word it's going to stick in your mind. It doesn't have to be nigger either. It could be bitch or asshole or dick etc etc etc.. And whatever that word may be that you are subjected to in a highly emotional state will be the first word that comes to mind when you encounter that state again. \\n\\nWe attach feelings to words in this way and it's not always the same for everyone everywhere. In some areas of the world among certain groups of people the use of the term cunt as a joking friendly gesture is typical with daily usage. In some areas among certain groups the term cunt is regarded as highly derogatory or sexist.  I'm not referring to the context here, but the implications of its usage. In the first example you are highly likely to call your friend a cunt when you're laughing, in a good mood with your friends. Heeey ya cunt! haha In the second example you would associate the term cunt with negative emotions and only when you're very upset with a person would you call them this. You fucking cunt! grr In both scenarios the term isn't used with any specificly objective definition behind it. Because it's all subjective. The definitions are malleable and entirely situational dependent upon your surroundings (including the people in them). Cunt: snarky, funny person and Cunt: horrible, rude person. AND Cunt: vulgar term to describe female genitalia. Just like with the term nigger. You have people calling their family and friends this on a daily basis; where in most cases it's a loving or joking manner. You my nigga. aww or That nigga just --- haha Forgive my shitty examples but you get my point.\\n\\nFor this reason I know that I could understand the accidental usage of the word. It doesn't make it right and I don't believe anyone should use it in a derogatory sense because it's a shitty word in general but also because of the racially charged connotations associated with it. After being exposed to the usage of the word and being called the word (I can't even guess how many times it would be playing an online shooter game; A LOT) while enraged it came out of his mouth in a similar situation afterwards. He could have used the term asshole/dick/bitch/cunt or whatever you find to be a generalized term for a shitty person in place of the word and it would have had the same meaning behind it but when you're directing insults at a person you tend to stick to vocabulary they associate with vulgarness to get your point across, so he used a hurtful word he knew would have that effect. I'm sure he wasn't thinking of all the black people he ever met and thought that the guy he was calling nigger was like them. If I call someone a dick I'm not thinking of all the dicks I ever saw and thinking that person is like those dicks. I'm just predisposed to the term dick to refer to a shitty person while angry. The angry name calling has nothing to do with dicks at all. I'm not a man hater or a dick hater. It's just a word. The person I call a dick or people that hear me call the person a dick may interpret what I say as me saying the person looks like an actual dick but that would definitely not be the case. Just like in the situation here. \\n\\nIn conclusion.... shit happens. People say shit when they're enraged. Most of the time they don't mean what you think or even mean anything they say at all. If you have ever been married or have had teenage children you know this much. People also interpret shit in different ways all over the world and even in the same house hold. You shouldn't use racially charged words with a heavy weight attached to them just to refer to someone as a shitty person. Just call them a dick. Unless you live somewhere that has some strange connotations associated with the term dick then just called them an asshole. Overall I forgive Pewdiepie (not that he needs me to forgive him) and his fuckup because it wasn't racially charged and people fuck up all the time (and for the reasons I gave above). No, I'm not pro calling someone nigger when you're mad at them, especially if it's racially charged and meant to be derogatory/discriminatory, and no I'm not racist against anyone anywhere. I'm just giving what I think is a reasonable point of view on the matter based on experience, study and alongside some personal anecdotes.",0,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,"We still love you Pewds. Words slip out, human error. Doesn't mean you really feel that way and any true gamer will know we say stupid shit when we game, we don't mean it at all, just caught in the moment. To those who are offended, you can't act like you haven't accidentally slipped up once. Anyone who's seen Pewds videos since day one knows he's not racist or a bad man.

What did he mean when he said what a fucking nig he was frustrated at the events taking place in the game and felt the need to vent his frustration by calling anonymous gamer a nig. \n\n\nSo.to those saying whats the big deal it was meant to offend thats why people are offended.,0,0

cLdxuaxaQwc,"some people are saying that it was a mistake, he regrets it. but that's not the fucking point. the word, was used in a negative way against the black community back when the whole slave thing happened. so if the first word that came to mind for felix was the n-word, it means he's used to it. it means he might use it behind the camera. who knows? he might call other people it. that's why it got so big, THAT was the problem. oh, and by the way technically he's not be 'racist' considering he didn't technically insult anyone, but it was still inappropriate and a lot of people would've been offended. it isn't his word to say, so he shouldn't be saying it. goodbye.\\n\\nedit: 'it's just a word!' so is racism, racism is just a word but your still annoyed when you get called it.",0,0

cLdxuaxaQwc,The word you used. In today society its use to desirable people. Not of a figure of the pass. But with the social intervals of today's time. Meany artist use the word as a person. The word can no longer be disclaimed as a black or white meaning. Even so PewDiePie Felix isn't even american. How could someone who was not educated by his society Knew the true difference of the word. I'm not black. I am a white male. Who has Irish blood. My generations has been throw the hardships of slavery too. Tbh much before the people of African distinct became slaves. Felix you do not have to apologetic. If anything you are making the problem worst. Im sorry you fucked up. It is True you shouldn't used the word but you are apologizing for the wrong reason. Its hard to say. im all over on this topic. but your not wrong or right by using a biases word like this. its because more artist and people use it in a matter that makes it ok to use. I feel when i hear the word in public. It doesn't have any real meaning or content to it. like when someone uses the worded love for every thing. SO in society it should have a impact but isn't.,1,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,this is the time i see pewdiepie so fucking serious it ok bro dont be nervous,1,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,"We get it Pewdiepie, you were caught up on the moment and it just slipped out we still love you. Everyone has been mad at a video game that they say some naughty words, even my white friendship say it but they don't mean it",2,0
cLdxuaxaQwc,"I have to say, all of the hate on Felix is ridiculous and something I cannot completely understand. Yes, the word he used was inappropriate and childish but people make mistakes, yet for some reason nobody can cut him that slack. He understands that he made a mistake and doesn't need people constantly reminding him of that. When someone without all of the spotlight on them does something like this they get scolded for maybe a day or two and then it's forgotten. But with all of the pressure placed on him not to screw up and to be the perfect person that nobody truly is he slipped up and is paying big time for that. So next time you attack him think about having one of the mistakes you regret broadcasted around the world for everyone to see and maybe have a little bit of forgiveness in your soul.",1,0

_MEFyG-IE_I,"Well the first movie was based on the original game, makes sense having the remake being based on the remake of the game, its just the main actress doesnt strike me as lara croft at all",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,I can't watch it without Angie. Sorry. & she would have still looked great for the role 17yrs later,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"I don't see any action star like Jolie in Hollywood today. I'm sure she's a good actress but you can't be Lara Croft without being badass first. So yea, I don't have high hopes.",0,0

_MEFyG-IE_I,"the new punisher trailer that recently rolled out is bad ass, more worth it than this bore of a trailer",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,Is there some deep meaning and incredible plot to the Tomb Raider story that I'm missing? When has it EVER been about anything other than a hot chick kicking ass?,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"The trailer should of been her locking the butler in the freezer, that would peak my interest.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,Well they played all the good parts in the trailer. I don't even need to see the movie.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"She doesn't match lara, looks a bit too ordinary and plain and also out of character. Her face doesn't match the character.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,Man!\nWhy do you brain wash me all the time! :(,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"Damn I was so excited for thia movie after the reboot prequel game that was freaking amazing, and then they cast vikander who looks so much like a young Lara, and now they're just making a bland action adventure movie that is nothing like that game",0,0

_MEFyG-IE_I,Not saying the movie is going to be dog shit while slipping in a reference to dogs shitting.\n\nI see what you did Jeremy.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,Best part of this video is the T-shirt....,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"Did nobody else notice this movie is based on the latest two Tomb Raider games?¬† The weapons, the costumes, the shipwreck?¬† Those two games reinvigorated the franchise so of course this won't feel like the old 90's series or Angelina's movies.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,I thought on one hand it looked like the new origin game but on the other hand it looked like complete shit,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"It looks so similar to the game recent reboot - I'm thinking why even bother. The game was great, just leave it be.",0,0

_MEFyG-IE_I,I knew this movie would be bad when they passed over Gemma Arterton for Alicia.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"Alicia is a good actress, but she rly lacks screen presence - looks dull and without any personality. Physically just doesn't click for me. You see her saying lines and it's like a bad game cutscene.",0,0

_MEFyG-IE_I,I didn't see the trailer so I don't have an opinion. Probably won't see the movie because I just don't care. Why am I here? Gotta do something while making a poopie.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,They should have picked that chick from the new games,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,Then Nathan Drake shows up with Elena at the end of the film.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,Looks dece.  The first Tomb Raider movie was good enough to watch and this looks like it could be similar,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"Here's the point I wanted to make: Obviously the CGI version of these scenes had WAY more value and detail. They didn't even try with this. And oh, her father again? I put my foot down ever since LAU! Bargain bin. But I wouldn't even try to find it there.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,more Gypsy and Danger videos :),0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"I swear to God, video games fans are the most needy viewerbase out there. 100% of details has to be perfect, otherwise the movie is immediately reduced to a pile of shit...",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,It looks low budget and it has a hitman agent 47 vibe for me. Looks very predictable but the action scenes looks fun though.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"Everyone wanted Daisy Ridly to play Lara Croft.\\nEveryone is mad we got Alicia Vikander.\\nEveryone keeps forgetting we ALREADY have a Lara Croft... Her name is Camillia Luddington and she is one of the best to take on the mantle as the Tomb Raider. Sure she is not the classic acrobatic dual gun wielding babe we grew to love but she is thee most real-life like Lara Croft ever seen. \\nBut since we didn't get her for the movie, it's safe to say she will continue as Lara in the games <3\\n\\nEveryone was kinda disappointed about how the new Tomb Raider game (2013) looked compared to TR Legends - Underworld but look at Tomb Raider now... It's a shiny example of a reboot done right.\\n\\nSo pls give Ms. Vikander a chance to proove her worth just as we let Ms. Luddington do the same.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,I truly believed it was a fan made trailer. By some high school kid who's (much) younger sister looks like a bad Lara Croft cosplayer.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"Not sure if it's more of the same or not because I've always avoided anything with Angelina Uglie, but having played the 2013 game I frickin loved this trailer and I can't wait to see it.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,I think Jessica biel or the actual chick that does the voice on the new game would had been a better choice .. I just don‚Äôt think this chick was good for the role she‚Äôs too skinny and in my opinion looks nothing like Lara Croft.. Jessica biel would had done it for me.. this chick doesn‚Äôt even have Lara Croft signature boobs and buttüòú yeah I also don‚Äôt know about this movie ü§îü§îü§î,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"The trailer was just Save the world bullshit, Nonsense that every video game movie director feels like it should have.",0,0

_MEFyG-IE_I,"never seen the first tomb raiders, ( cause I'm Not an Idiot ) ,but this trailer Looks Awesome as Hell !!!",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"Not that I think this is going to be great but why would your think they were just going to retell the game story? its been told just introduce her and get her into some new adventure. the first TR movies didnt try to retell a game story and that was one of the things that actually worked for it. in this they've clearly aimed to get the rebooted Lara on screen. a more realistic physique, some one who gets her hands dirty... it should be viewed with a little... oh wait Hollywood CNE get its head around just making _regular_ movies why assume they k ow how to translate THIS to screen. Compare the trailer for this to the trailer of the last game and you'll already see where they've gone wrong.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"Oh, Jeremy, I love you so much! THIS is the opinion. Not like some weird nonsense about Alicia Vikander not having boobs :|",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,I prefer the naive looks of lara from the game.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"Hey Jeremy, do the trailer for Ready Player One. Heard Steven Speilberg's doing it this time.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"The movie itself doesn't look bad. It seems to have a lot of action and stunts, which is great for an action movie. But it also feels like they're doing the same they did with Baywatch. Using the name of a classic TV show/video game, as an excuse for an action movie just to make more money. For me, they've totally ruined this by casting Alicia Vikander as Lara Croat. I'm not saying she isn't a talented actress. I'm just saying she's not a good Lara Croft, and I think the problem with her is that her features aren't very feminine. Lara Croft is supposed to be a femme fatale. Elegant and badass at the same time. Curvy and delicate, but intimidating. That's why people fell in love with Angelina Jolie. Long story short: Alicia Vikander looks like a little boy with long hair.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,I thought the trailer was crap.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,wow Jeremy you're a douchebag its a teaser give the fucking movie a chance,0,0

_MEFyG-IE_I,"I disliked the trailer for this movie, liked this video by Jeremy. I LOVE how he didn't go all fanboy this trailer looked so cool, she jumps a lot, I'm pumped because action! I'll always appreciate how Jeremy actually has standards and realizes just how predictable the shitty quality of movies that are video game adaptations are. Keep up the genuinely *awesometacular* reviews Jeremy! :D",0,0

_MEFyG-IE_I,"Learn to challenge your preconception of what this movie could be, and then maybe you might enjoy it more.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"I mean this not to troll or be nasty, but the casting feels way off\\nGo look at the thumbnail for the tomb raider trailer\\nIs that Lara Croft, unstoppable adventurer who's been through hell and back and won't let anyone get in her way?\\nOR, is it a 16 year old dressing up as Lara Croft for a party trying to do her best angry face.\\nAdditionally, I know she had some rigorous work out routine to get in shape for the movie, but she looks stick thin.\\nAng Jolie looked BUFF in the older films, like she could very reasonably take on any guy in her way \\nIt only adds to the feeling that she's not fit for the role",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"She looks so awkward on the poster and the pose is so weird like what happend to your neck girl?? And the thing is, the way she holds that bow in the trailer looks soooo weak and wrong. Even jennifer lawrence in the hungergames made it look cool.",0,0

_MEFyG-IE_I,Well my dog is pretty smart she rings a bell to go out! And magically eats her bone perfectly down the middle horizontal! Lol,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,Remember back when her original backstory is she was with some old guy in a tomb and they fucked around for a bit and she found a backpack and it turned out she needed to find some ancient artifact to seal a god away?\n\n\nNow tomb raider = Uncharted with tits and lots of abuse,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,Is it just me? Or did a lot of what was in the trailer look like an overly dramatic point for point shot of the Tomb Raider remake?\n\nI'm out... not going to see this one. I've already seen it.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,It's pretty much the same plot line to uncharted,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"It looks good to be honest but I wished they explore the childhood, character development of Lara..but the new Lara is Gorgeous!",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,You name your dog Gypsy and Danger... Awesome.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"Looks a little CGI-heavy in some parts, but still looks good to me.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"Pretty much every single action piece in this trailer was ripped straight from the first rebooted tomb raider game. And if they are going to start the movie with her being a hardened badass, those scenes won't have anywhere near the impact of what they had in the game. They will just seem like typical flashy action pieces. Her transition from innocent, naive explorer into hardened, badass killer is what made the rebooted game so fucking good in the first place. I'm holding out a little hope because it is just a trailer so far, but the blatant copy and paste and seemingly starting her off as a badass is worrying",0,0

_MEFyG-IE_I,Such a moving speech,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,This is exactly the first game lol the game was a lot of fun and awesome hopefully they capture that Bc it seems like a remake of it and not going off and adding shit like others have done,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"I'm not about to judge a movie before it comes out; Trailer didn't get me too excited, but still enough that I would watch it. Not going to know what I think of the film, until I watch the film.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"I actually really liked the very first Tomb Raider, it's campy, but a fun movie.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"I don't give two shits whether or not Alicia looks like Lara or not, I'm more worried about the fact that they took the best part of the first Tomb Raider reboot(the Lara origin story and her progression into a confident badass) and combined it with the worst part of the second reboot game(Trinity). I really was hoping they'd go for the origin story and intertwine the bits about PTSD from the first game that were totally abandoned in the 2nd. From the looks of it they didn't do the source material justice and that's a shame because Lara is one of my favorite female leads in gaming as of late. And so far I've been somewhat disappointed with the female leads we've gotten in film recently.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"You should release a bloopers-video, the times you've messed up whilst recording. I'd enjoy watching that ^-^",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,warcraft and resident evil 1 was soild enough. still one of the best reboot video game gotta be mortal kombat legacy mini series. i don't think we have a logan or dark knight quality of the video game movie genre just yet. üòÅ,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,Easy way to make money is doing reaction or review on something that isn't out yet.,1,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"Okay, big fan of the Tomb Raider franchise here and honestly I thought the trailer was ok, just okay, it was basically a teaser trailer. It wasn't perfect, just okay. The father message was a bit bad but it reminded me of the scene in the first Tomb Raider film where Jon Voight (Lara's dad) tells Lara about the aligning of the stars and how she'd have to stop the bad guys from doing what they were doing, only that was done better. But maybe it'll be done better in the film and it was just edited wrong but that's what that scene reminded me of, it was a nice little nod but I haven't seen anyone notice. Now, this Tomb Raider movie is a reboot and it's based on the TR game reboot. For the most part, people LOVED that 2013 reboot. Hell, Casino Royale got criticism because Bond was BLONDE & after it came out, people went crazy over how good it was and how it captured Bond's coldness and brutal kills. So why are people thinking this'll be shit? It's not based on any of the other movies or games, but the 2013 reboot game Lara, that's why she has the bow and arrow and looks the way she does. She's Lara just starting out. Hell, most of the damn trailer was stuff from the 2013 game, her jumping from the ship, her getting knocked out on the beach, her facing off against armed men on the island, her jumping from the wing of the plane etc.\\n\\nHell her getting TWO pistols at the end is a nod to her using her legendary dual pistols and her using them later in the 2013 game. Damn, people, just wait for it to come out and see how it is. And another thing, Alicia Vikander is hot as fuck, google Alicia Vikander Hot and see how ugly she is lol. And with all the video game movies are bad, terrible or shit, has anyone here seen the first Silent Hill film? That was a damn good film and was easily the closest interpretation to the games even though it wasn't EXACTLY the same. People need to learn to give shit a chance. This seriously reminds me of the Casino Royale thing but it's not Bond's blonde and not enough humor, it's Lara's tits are small and Alicia's not hot enough to play Lara. Smh. Her boobs haven't been big since Angel of Darkness lol.",1,0

_MEFyG-IE_I,"It looks OK. To me this movie, in order to be good, should take a different approach and really focus on character, and the mythology. Let us get to know HER. Make her somebody we want to root for. That makes the action sequences work, when you put the character that we care about in peril. If it's just all bullshit one-liners and one cartoon physics action sequence after another, then it'll suck.",0,0

The point of the reboot of the game in 2013 was to start Lara fresh as just an athletic student who wants to follow her father's footstep because she believed that her dad wasn't crazy like the world said, and she's out looking for what her father has seen.  She didn't go out to there because her dad ask her to stop the bad guys!",0,0

Maybe one day scriptwriters will realise scale isn't everything. Although i expect the action to be good",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"It looks awful. The Tomb Raider reboot is one of my favorite games. They changed Lara for the better, in my humble opinion. She started out that game as a normal woman and ended it as the ultimate survivor. And it was awesome seeing that change happen progressively, and I was really hoping that was the tone they were going for. But no, it looks like they had someone look at a supercut on YouTube of various badass moments from the game and built a script around that. I don't understand it. When Hollywood wants to make a good book adaptation, they look at what made the book great, and build the script around that. Changing what they have to, but if it ends up well, it keeps the spirit of that book while turning out a good movie. Same with comics, older tv shows, etc. But for some reason, they don't think they have to put as much effort when making movies based on video games and anime and I don't get why.",0,0

To be quite honest right off the bat in the intro I could already tell there was something off about your makeup. Once you zoomed in I realized that the foundation does not look good at all!

4gKhm09PKPQ,"Using the Tsar bomba as an example is more than a tad bit unrealistic seeing as it was never intended to be used operationally, was not ICBM capable and was so heavy that even strapping it on a TU-95 would result in too poor range and speed performance to make it viable (It weighed the equivalent of 15 average cars), Not only that but its explosive radius was so high that it was actually less effective because much of its explosive force was actually radiated out into space. The highest yield deployed weapon used by the Soviet Union was the SS-18 Mod 3 with an explosive power of 25 Megatons, the same as the U.S.A's highest yield weapon, the B41. Lastly, even these largest yield deployed weapons were only really used in small numbers",2,0

_MEFyG-IE_I,"I'm trying to NOT have expectations. This works in real life, too. I do it all the time. Nothing will ever go right. Then when it does, boom! I love the crap outta Tomb Raider. One of my favorite games. I can not tell you how many times I've played the original game. I was 12 when that game came out. I definitely wanna see this. But I'm probably going to be cringing the entire time. Who knows! Maybe it'll be another guilty pleasure movie like the ridiculous RE films.",0,0

_MEFyG-IE_I,"I'm glad you touched on it, Jeremy, but it's really bothering me that they're leaning so heavily on the reboot for tone and visuals, but seemingly the plot is Lara Croft going on an adventure to save the world as opposed to Lara Croft going to explore some neat ruins or something and suddenly having to fight for her life.\\n\\nLike, that was a big draw of the story and tone of the reboot game. Lara obviously had some skills in survival and whatnot, but we got to see her pushed (at least partially) into becoming the badass who goes looking for danger.",0,0

The first season of Netflix Castlevania was awesome and incredibly promising, Sonic Boom got very enjoyable by the end of season 2, and the Pok√©mon TV show is...well, I don't know if it's still on the air, but it definitely has its appeal.

_MEFyG-IE_I,It looks straight up awful.  The plot set up with her father asking her to basically go get herself killed to save the world from a Mcguffin . . . That sounds atrocious.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"I'm totally with Jeremy on this one.  Saw the trailer, even left a comment.  Where the hell is the survivor aspect?  The point of the reboot of the game in 2013 was to start Lara fresh as just an athletic student who wants to follow her father's footstep because she believed that her dad wasn't crazy like the world said, and she's out looking for what her father has seen.  She didn't go out to there because her dad ask her to stop the bad guys!",0,0

_MEFyG-IE_I,"It looks awful. The Tomb Raider reboot is one of my favorite games. They changed Lara for the better, in my humble opinion. She started out that game as a normal woman and ended it as the ultimate survivor. And it was awesome seeing that change happen progressively, and I was really hoping that was the tone they were going for. But no, it looks like they had someone look at a supercut on YouTube of various badass moments from the game and built a script around that. I don't understand it. When Hollywood wants to make a good book adaptation, they look at what made the book great, and build the script around that. Changing what they have to, but if it ends up well, it keeps the spirit of that book while turning out a good movie. Same with comics, older tv shows, etc. But for some reason, they don't think they have to put as much effort when making movies based on video games and anime and I don't get why.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"Dissapointed, typical big bad group destroy world, only you can stop them Like how do they expect that to be thrilling to the viewer? we've seen it done a billion times and especially when there's next to no world building why should we care so much?

_MEFyG-IE_I,Trailer didnt catch me and i did not buy Vikander as Lara Croft.

4gKhm09PKPQ,So you dismiss the fallout shelter because it wont service a nuclear blast? Of course it wont survive it is not a blast shelter it is a FALLOUT shelter. A blast shelter and fallout shelter are two totally different concepts so to say the fallout shelter is ineffective is completely incorrect. Also trying to say that surviving is a bad thing because you would emerge into a post nuclear war world is one of the stupidest concepts I've ever heard. We have seen first hand in Japan how easily cities can recover from nuclear war. Recovering from war is never an easy thing but for me it is far more preferable than death due to radiation.\n\nAlso to answer the question in the description; yes fallout shelters work as advertised. The need to stay sheltered is only there for about two weeks. After that it is safe to emerge from the shelter and evacuate the affected area. Also the hole duck and cover thing is to a good idea. If you are on the outskirts of the blast area your biggest problem is flying debri so ducking and covering could save your life.,0,0

_MEFyG-IE_I,I am SOOO LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS FILM :)!!!,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,I thought the trailer looked straight to videoish and kinda boring.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,Looked like shit is probably going to be shit wont be watching that shit.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"Basically, Alicia Vikander and possibly the rest of the cast deserve better than the writing, direction and tone that the movie might have as a whole. The photos and posters seemed to promise a dark and gritty atmosphere that the reboot games delivered. But then the trailer comes out and it's like the late 90s again. \\n\\nAlso, this whole Angelina Jolie thing...why is she being brought up in so many comments? Is everyone making fun of the fact that certain people pretend to love older versions of movies or some shit? That's like, Man, Ben Affleck will always be Daredevil. I'm not feeling this Netflix series.\\n\\nTotally different dimension guys.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,Most of the scenes from the trailer match the new video game that came out a while back,0,0

_MEFyG-IE_I,"I just feel like the movie will be rushed... in the Tomb Raider game reboot, the first game was essential her being dropped in an unknown world and discovering shit while still being talented in survival. It would be nice if this Tomb Raider was survival based and focus a ton on Lara instead of the side characters.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,I wanted to see the innocent fragile girl who almost cried having to kill an animal for food Origin Story... oh wait she's already THE Tomb Raider...,0,0

_MEFyG-IE_I,"Nigga if people do what you do in regards to videogame movies then nobody would've seen Batman Begins. The trailer was shit, let's be honest. And by that time Superhero movies had gone the way of Shaft. I'm not saying Tomb Raider will be good, in fact, I now it will be shit, but give me a break, man.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,You know what would have been a better film? Two games in one...Nathan Drake and Lara Croft go on an adventure! This film looking terrible and Lara looks bored.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"I liked Vikander in Ex Machina and she is a good actress for the reboot Lara. But the trailer looks like a 90ies movie to me with all the bad greenscreen and general cheesiness. The music was especially bad, so for me the trailer did nothing - except that it was good to see some Frost again.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,Trailer didnt catch me and i did not buy Vikander as Lara Croft. Definately not the badass Lara from the old games and still not the just growing into adventure Lara Croft from the new games. She is just a well trained good looking but skinny girl in the jungle. With guns. Does not feel like Tomb Raider at all. Trailer has no soul to me. I dont believe in this movie. I hope im wrong.,0,0

_MEFyG-IE_I,Jeremy your shirt is awesome and so is your dogs names!,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,I think the main problem with the trailer is its editing. \nThere is no way that clip at the end of the trailer where she is buying guns ins't from the end of the movie.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,One question.. why her ?\nShe is the definite opposite of a badass,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,You could make a legit Far Cry 3 movie.. That story was awesome,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,You know what you can do J? Why not review Tomb Raider (2013) and Rise of the Tomb Raider?,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,Looked like a straight Blu-Ray trailer,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,looks horrible the game has better CGI and cost less to make lol,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"I totally agree, just play the damn game! You'll have more fun! I feel sad about Alicia Vikander, I mean, yeah she will probably get money and all but being in a movie of a videogame will probably hurt her career.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,The trailer looks pretty good.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,No one can Lara Croft like Angelina Jolie. She was perfect. This actress looks like Lara Croft the early years and I can accept that.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"I never look forward to VG movies but if they was to announce a God of War movie, I‚Äôd lose my shit",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,I hope they let her learn how to be the Tomb Raider. If she come out whipping the floor with people then ima be pissed. I feel like she will have very little to learn about survival.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,Review the new punisher trailer please!,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,am I the only one that doesn't like the actor who's playing Lara Croft because she's doesn't look like in the video game in 2015 and the old games?,0,0

_MEFyG-IE_I,"It looked like shit. I don't want any movie to be shit and hope am proven wrong like Wonder Woman, but sometimes you can't help but say like it's bad from the trailer.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"Thing about videogame movies is, that they mostly just pick the easy, uninteresting ones. Like wtf is special about Tomb Raider, its Indianna Jones, but with a girl. I bet they are gonna record Uncharted too at some point. The only interesting videogame movie was Warcraft, because thats an original world, and despite its flaws, I still like that movie.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"I'm trying to NOT have expectations. This works in real life, too. I do it all the time. Nothing will ever go right. Then when it does, boom! I love the crap outta Tomb Raider. One of my favorite games. I can not tell you how many times I've played the original game. I was 12 when that game came out. I definitely wanna see this. But I'm probably going to be cringing the entire time. Who knows! Maybe it'll be another guilty pleasure movie like the ridiculous RE films.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,Dog shit! I expected a top class movie for tomb raider.....so disappointed. And i wanted to see her grow and become the tomb raider but clearly thats too hard for the producers.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"Why do they keep picking games with cookie cutter stories? tomb raider is JUST indiana jones. STOP. Legacy of kain, Planescape Torment, GOD DAMN",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,Any one else reminded of the iron fist trailer or was it just me.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,The first Jolie one was perfectly stupid.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"I'm glad you touched on it, Jeremy, but it's really bothering me that they're leaning so heavily on the reboot for tone and visuals, but seemingly the plot is Lara Croft going on an adventure to save the world as opposed to Lara Croft going to explore some neat ruins or something and suddenly having to fight for her life.\\n\\nLike, that was a big draw of the story and tone of the reboot game. Lara obviously had some skills in survival and whatnot, but we got to see her pushed (at least partially) into becoming the badass who goes looking for danger.",0,0

_MEFyG-IE_I,"say what you want about the original tomb raider movies but they were fun guilty pleasures. angelina jolie is lara croft to me. not this actress. she had the wit, charisma, charm of lara. alicia doesn't do it for me.",0,0

_MEFyG-IE_I,"agree, looks s**t",1,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"At what point will the entertainment industry realize that video game TV adaptations are the better way to go, critically speaking? The first season of Netflix Castlevania was awesome and incredibly promising, Sonic Boom got very enjoyable by the end of season 2, and the Pok√©mon TV show is...well, I don't know if it's still on the air, but it definitely has its appeal. So I say we stop making video game movies and just start making video game TV shows instead. I for one would happily welcome a Bioshock TV show",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,Thanks for going philosophical on us Jeremy! Great message!,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,The best part was 3:15,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,It looks straight up awful.  The plot set up with her father asking her to basically go get herself killed to save the world from a Mcguffin . . . That sounds atrocious.,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"I'm totally with Jeremy on this one.  Saw the trailer, even left a comment.  Where the hell is the survivor aspect?  The point of the reboot of the game in 2013 was to start Lara fresh as just an athletic student who wants to follow her father's footstep because she believed that her dad wasn't crazy like the world said, and she's out looking for what her father has seen.  She didn't go out to there because her dad ask her to stop the bad guys!",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,2:04-2:13 Did the guy who's bent over to every MCU film & Star Wars cash grab just say that. Smfh,0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"It looks awful. The Tomb Raider reboot is one of my favorite games. They changed Lara for the better, in my humble opinion. She started out that game as a normal woman and ended it as the ultimate survivor. And it was awesome seeing that change happen progressively, and I was really hoping that was the tone they were going for. But no, it looks like they had someone look at a supercut on YouTube of various badass moments from the game and built a script around that. I don't understand it. When Hollywood wants to make a good book adaptation, they look at what made the book great, and build the script around that. Changing what they have to, but if it ends up well, it keeps the spirit of that book while turning out a good movie. Same with comics, older tv shows, etc. But for some reason, they don't think they have to put as much effort when making movies based on video games and anime and I don't get why.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"Dissapointed, typical big bad group destroy world, only you can stop them Like how do they expect that to be thrilling to the viewer? we've seen it done a billion times and especially when there's next to no world building why should we care so much? Maybe one day scriptwriters will realise scale isn't everything. Although i expect the action to be good",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"Wow, the behind the scenes trailer is SO MUCH BETTER at most any level than this one that it doesn't even makes sense they would go with the one they went.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"The studios are like your dogs. We think they've learned not to shit on the carpet, but they do it when we aren't looking.",0,0
_MEFyG-IE_I,"It looks OK. To me this movie, in order to be good, should take a different approach and really focus on character, and the mythology. Let us get to know HER. Make her somebody we want to root for. That makes the action sequences work, when you put the character that we care about in peril. If it's just all bullshit one-liners and one cartoon physics action sequence after another, then it'll suck.",1,0

I, as a person with oily skin with little to no skin concerns except for a few acne spots, like the foundation, it works well with me but it's nothing out of the ordinary. Yes she came out with a lot of shades but as most lines do, there's not enough neutrals! I don't know what world these brands live in who assume everyone who is light to medium is yellow and everyone that's darker is red. I dislike the shades a lot. I do not like the match sticks very much, especially the shimmers, waaaay too glittery.

I tried to set it with my settings spray after I was done with my makeup,  as this step normally tones down that powdery look but even that didn't help. It's just very drying.

p25S_5P6ejg,"Thank you for your honest review! I love that you took your time trying out these products before posting your review! That makes the video and your opinion a lot better! I had the same issue with her foundation! It just didn‚Äôt sit well on my skin, no matter what primer I used. It was beautiful at first, but after an hour or 2, my oils started peaking through. It looked AWFUL on my t-zone, especially my nose. It looked like it was just melting right off, and I wear glasses too so my glasses were covered in makeup, with two line indentions on my nose. The sponge, I love it and hate it. I love that it CAN give you a natural finish on days where you don‚Äôt want full glam, however, with my full coverage concealers like the Tarte Shape-Tape, it did soak up the product a lot and left it looking like I had no coverage under my eyes. Her highlighters are EVERYTHING. I love using my ColourPop cream highlighters first then applying the highlighter on top for a big BANG! Lol. ‚ù§Ô∏è Thanks Casey for the video!

p25S_5P6ejg,It makes me sad that some of you feel the need to apologize bc products didn't work for you.

4gKhm09PKPQ,So you dismiss the fallout shelter because it wont service a nuclear blast? Of course it wont survive it is not a blast shelter it is a FALLOUT shelter. A blast shelter and fallout shelter are two totally different concepts so to say the fallout shelter is ineffective is completely incorrect. Also trying to say that surviving is a bad thing because you would emerge into a post nuclear war world is one of the stupidest concepts I've ever heard. We have seen first hand in Japan how easily cities can recover from nuclear war. Recovering from war is never an easy thing but for me it is far more preferable than death due to radiation.\n\nAlso to answer the question in the description; yes fallout shelters work as advertised. The need to stay sheltered is only there for about two weeks. After that it is safe to emerge from the shelter and evacuate the affected area. Also the hole duck and cover thing is to a good idea. If you are on the outskirts of the blast area your biggest problem is flying debri so ducking and covering could save your life.,0,0

In the US, it would be hard to make that 1,000.\\n\\nTo get public transportation to European levels, would require massive investment to achieve adequate luxury and availability.

My dentist was another block further.  Within 4 blocks I could get to a number of parks that included pools, ice skating, and athletic fields.  A mile would get me to sailing, walking, beach swimming and free concerts.  None of this was planned out, and now this neighborhood has gentrified to being a trendy, highly desirable location.  \\n\\nWith my last neighborhood, in a highly regulated, planned community, most of what I could within walking distance was other houses.  The elementary school was convenient, the middle school is bike trip away, but the high school is definitely a car trip, as well as the grocery store.  Now that I left, there is now some retail within a bike trip distance.  But the primary thing is there are these big fields that separate the housing from the retail.

-cjfTG8DbwA,"I think a major part of it is simply do to the fact that America has so much wealth as a collective that most people can afford to own a car. It's not uncommon to see a household with a father mother and 16-18 year old all with their own form of transportation. Also it's engrained in American culture. America love cars and it's almost a right of passage to get a car in most cases before your out of high school. Simply put there is no real reason to spend massive amounts of money on public transportation when the majority of Americans own a car, America has an interstate system that allows you to drive pretty much anywhere, and if you don't want to drive you can fly in a plane.

-cjfTG8DbwA,"Houston is the largest city in NA with no zoning restrictions and it's mass transportation is a complete mess. In fact in one of your earlier videos you mentioned how it has the worst traffic congestion in the country. You also left out two HUGE factors for the lack of mass transit. The first is that the EPA makes it too expensive and too long to implement a mass transit system. Look how terrible the bullet train in California is going due to the environmentalist suing the project every step of the way.  Also, your point about car subsidies makes no sense seeing as how Germany, Japan, and Britain massively subsidizes their auto industry yet both have successful mass transit. The second point was race relations. People in the 40s and 50s didn't want to share with blacks. When MLK made it so buses could no longer discriminate against blacks that just drove all the white people away. The whites were the ones with the tax dollars so they proceeded to slash funding for mass transit as they were no longer using it. Even today people don't like sharing mass transit with poor people. If you ever ride a bus in Detroit you will see it packed with smelly homeless people. These homeless people will shit their pants while sleeping on the seats, and because of the ACLU you can't kick them off because that's racist or something. So even if you make the best mass transit system imaginable it will still go unused with time due to the people who want to use it in the first place, the middle class, not wanting to share space with smelly homeless and poor people.  America is not a racially and homogeneous place like yurope is, and so unless you kick out all the immigrants we will never have successful mass transit. People will only use mass transit when they think it is safe, and the more diversity you have the less safe people will feel.",1,0

By charging high tolls on their highways, they force motorists to pay for the construction and maintenance of those highways.  This may price the poor off the highways- but any such access they received would be subsidized.  Instead, the capital that would have gone to constructing bigger and more extensive highways if everyone used them can be better-invested to expand the RAIL network in India to provide the poor with inter-city transportation: provided that private investors can be convinced that tolls on roadways will remain high, and the government will not cave to political pressure to lower them- so rail companies will be able to sustainably charge fares that only remain price-competitive when automobiles are not subsidized...",1,0

And Marxist along with white-guilt self-loathers want us to   give blacks glorification for their violence and debauchery. It's only going to get worse. Blacks are extremely jealous and hate white people . They want everything given to them and get upset when they aren't treated like kangz.

p25S_5P6ejg,Girl. Thank you for keeping this so real. This is literally the most honest review I've seen. So many of the influencers are praising the line when it's clear that the swatches of the highlighters and the contour sticks look dry and low pigment.

I am very oily, but I don‚Äôt have texture, so for me it is a hit. Everyone should try it if they think they may like it, you sharing your experiences helps people decide if they want to try it.

p25S_5P6ejg,"People online are out of hand nowadays. I'm so put off from this brand now because some of these people that got offended over nothing.

p25S_5P6ejg,"This brand is cool and I like Rihanna. I, as a person with oily skin with little to no skin concerns except for a few acne spots, like the foundation, it works well with me but it's nothing out of the ordinary. Yes she came out with a lot of shades but as most lines do, there's not enough neutrals! I don't know what world these brands live in who assume everyone who is light to medium is yellow and everyone that's darker is red. I dislike the shades a lot. I do not like the match sticks very much, especially the shimmers, waaaay too glittery. I PERSONALLY THINK TROPHY WIFE IS NOT PRETTY üò¨ if we took her name off this and slapped another brand name on this, the hype wouldn't be as much as it is.

I applied for a loan from him, the loan was approved easily without stress and all the preparations where made concerning the loan transfer and in exactly 3 days I received my loan in my bank account. If you really need a legitimate loan without stress, please do well to contact his company at markhendrixloanfirm@gmail.com\\n\\nThey may not know am doing this but i pray that God will bless them for the good thing they have done for me and I strongly believe other persons are testifying.",0,0

-cjfTG8DbwA,"I have my own reasons why Transit sucks in the US. \\n- Transit agencies are more interested in building infrastructure empires than in moving people;- Politicians are more interested in building new infrastructure than maintaining the old; the industry has seen a 50-percent decline in worker productivity since it was municipalized in the 40's onward.-Transit planners refuse to accept that cities no longer have the same job and residential concentrations that they had 100 years ago.The video repeatedly points to Europe as providing examples of successful public transportation systems. However, it never mentions that, while Europe may have more public transportation than the United States, that doesn‚Äôt mean Europeans use it that much more. According to the European Union, The average European rides trams and metros (what we call light  and \\nheavy rail) 200 kilometers per year vs. Americans‚Äô 100 kilometers per year. Yes, that‚Äôs twice as much, but the difference‚Äì62 miles‚Äìis insignificant compared with the 5,800 miles that Europeans by car each year. Europeans would drive much more if their governments didn‚Äôt punitively tax motor fuel. The video also mentions that access to public transportation helps \\npoor people find jobs. But it never mentions that access to automobiles does much more for poor people because people can reach many times as many jobs by car in 30 minutes as they can access by public transportation. The real reason public transportation sucks is because it is \\nobsolete. Nearly 96 percent of working Americans have at least one car \\nin their households and around 30 percent of those who don‚Äôt \\nnevertheless get to work by car. With the possible exception of New York\\n City, we don‚Äôt need transit anymore and it‚Äôs time for the government to\\n stop trying to force it on us.",0,0

-cjfTG8DbwA,You Should go to Russia !!! You'll just love it there..,0,0
-cjfTG8DbwA,"You're video makes it clear that you became blinded by your conclusion - i.e. that public transit is what we all should be using - and failed to consider the alternatives.  Like all too many urban planners you have become fixated on a concept of how people ought to live their lives and then deliberately ignore how people actually live their lives.\\n\\nWhen given a choice, people will choose options that give them more freedom, not less.  Public transit is inherently a choice limiting option that reduces the freedom people have in choosing how they wish to move themselves about.  Yes, you can speak volumes about how wonderfully efficient public transit can be at moving large numbers of people from point A to point B.  But public transit systems require the individual to conform his life and to the limited options available in a public transit system.  \\n\\nTrains, buses, and street cars only operate on their schedule - and not on the individual's schedule which is what better meets his needs or wants.  Public transit only goes to certain destinations and only does so at certain times and certain frequencies.  Even in our most densely populated cities with the most well matured public transit systems they all still operate at a net loss and require massive public subsidies to continue operating.  \\n\\nLike most urban planners who bemoan private ownership of personal vehicles, your proposed solutions call for even more hideously expensive and invasive public transit infrastructure which would do little to meet the needs of how people actually live.  This, no matter how closely those elaborate public transit systems meet the utopian desires of the urban planners.\\n\\nInstead of more hideously expensive public transit solutions we should be finding ways of accommodating how people already prefer to transport themselves - by their own personal vehicles.  Double deck the highways, make more parking structures in downtown areas, eliminate the High Occupancy Vehicle lanes on our existing highways as they're nothing but wasted road capacity.  \\n\\nMake it easier for people to get around on their own in their own vehicles.  That will drive the economy far better than more massive spending on public transit systems.",0,0

hEdvvTF5js4,"Ok one explanation of the video; let me know what you think. Father passes away and boy wants to follow his father's dream of heading into space. The boy begins to build his rocket by receiving help from a teacher, librarian, and old scientist. The scene with the boy and the old scientist is important because it shows that the boy's idea of shooting himself into space has now become a dangerous obsession. The old man then makes a motion with a wrench near his head. I believe the old man is telling the boy he needs to grieve and repair his mind, not focus on the dangerous undertaking of building an actual rocket ship. The boy ignores the man and takes the fake spare part from the man. We know it's fake because the old man later meets with the mom and assures her that it is just a toy with nothing to worry about. Unfortunately, I think the boy does die here from carbon monoxide in the garage. The mother grieves for her lost son by launching the rocket and though everyone is surprised it actually flies, the mother is not, because the ship is symbolic of her letting go. It is her grief, love, and acceptance that launches the rocket and her son into space to be with his Dad. That's my take. What are your thoughts?",1,0

And Marxist along with white-guilt self-loathers want us to   give blacks glorification for their violence and debauchery. It's only going to get worse. Blacks are extremely jealous and hate white people . They want everything given to them and get upset when they aren't treated like kangz.

xwW0VfkFljE,"Okay so if she‚Äôs the one with the allergy, why is she so resistant to leaving? She didn‚Äôt do what the stipulations were saying and being very difficult. If she‚Äôd just cooperated, it would‚Äôve been fine. If she was so concerned about her allergy, why didn‚Äôt she just go? They probably would‚Äôve worked with her to book another flight. I have a feeling she was hoping that the person and their pet would‚Äôve been removed and not her, but that plan backfired. Also, when you call a cop in, he‚Äôs not security, he‚Äôs law. You do what he says. You resist, his training kicks in and you‚Äôre in trouble. She was also obviously not trying to walk, she was pressing against the seats and resisting and then death glaring the officer. So what, she‚Äôs a professor? My grandmother is a minister‚Äôs wife but she has to all but strip for security every time she flies. She has very thick hair that she puts up with metal pins and they check it every time. She doesn‚Äôt resist and tries to cooperate however she can. It goes smoothly. Unlike this incident.",2,1

We spent 12 years and 10 billion to date building a 2 mile ugly lopsided new Bay Bridge in S.F./Oakland whose weight is the only thing holding it down.\\nAmerica is the only modern country left that has not one inch of advanced High Speed Rail.

A word does not exist in any language that would adequately describe the disdain I hold for these people and the ones in our government and our courts that let them do it.\\nGoogle National City Lines. It's an important part of our history because it marks the point in time America went off the rails and if you're unfamiliar with what happened, it will infuriate you. \\n\\nBetween 1936 and 1950, National City Lines, a holding company sponsored and funded by GM, Firestone, and Standard Oil of California, bought out more than 100 electric surface-traction systems in 45 cities (including New York, Philadelphia, St. Louis, Salt Lake City, Tulsa, Los Angeles and San Francisco's Key System) for the purpose of running them into the ground, dismantling them and replacing with GM buses... In 1949 GM and its partners were convicted in our corrupt U.S.district court in Chicago of criminal conspiracy in this matter and fined $5,000. This was part of the plan so a future generation could not make them pay for what they did (Double Jeopardy Laws)\\n\\nAmericans are so spoonfed stupid sometimes.

You would need to take drive to a train station, take a train to the downtown station, then take another train / subway line out to the other town(if it even has service), then you will then have to take a bus from there to somewhere near work and walk the the rest of the way or take a taxi/Uber if available.

The argument was that buses would allow more flexibility in the lines and would allow business districts to expand more freely since they didn't need to be planned around rails. In reality GM knew that metropolitan areas were better served by rigid infrastructure, but that buses were better for long distance travel. So GM wanted to make buses part of the rigid infrastructure through local routes, and then connect them to long distance inter-city bus routes to force travel to grow around buses and passenger cars.\\n\\nGeneral Motors has been doing what they want long before the ignition switch scandal, long before surpressing electric vehicles, and long before the cost-oriented engineering failures of the Corvair.",0,0

This is also symptomatic of greater overall inefficiency and mismanagement by the people running Tuscon, with horribly run road construction/repair projects all over the place.",1,0

There were several bags of fast food sitting and spilling over on seats. The London Underground wasn't great, but most food had been picked up and there was no slushie river. And the Tokyo metro was so clean I felt like I could eat and sleep in it. It was spotless. I'll never think about how nice the BART was and want back on.

First it is not the position of the Federal Government to create or run the municipal transit systems, (which is probably a good thing, when you take into account how Amtrak is underfunded and a complete mess. Second Amtrak is only a provider of regional and inter city rail in the US. They don't run the local transit systems. Third it is up to the individual state and local municipality to create and fund the transit system. The federal government does provide some capital through grants, and other monies to help the projects but those come with strings attached that many cities don't want added to the projects. Usually needing to expand the highways, or airports. Since the states have to fund the projects they usually don't have the capital to make significant changes to their systems and usually do everything as low budget as possible.",0,0

Your argument fails the premise you started with which was about public transit which quickly devolved to an equating that with streetcars. Ford and GM bought up public transit and forced the automobile for urban use down the throats of the people, essentially, at gun point. Why has it stayed bad? Because the ultra rich hijacked the nation and refuse to allow economic competition, local governments -- just like the national government -- ceased to serve their constituents and pander almost entirely to the threats and temper tantrums of the rich. That would have been an honest answer to your original argument. So, a better way to talk about segregation in zoning is to talk about segregation in neighborhoods -- by race. Way to pass over the evil of the American rich without pausing to recognize the reality of what you're talking about. So in summation the US is poorer and more ignorant than comparable nations due to the guile and racism of the affluent who have forced their ethos on the nation through laws and propaganda.",0,0

I grew up in Atlanta where MARTA (Metro Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority) has a fairly good system.  However, every time they try to improve it, they immediately get met with lawsuits, protests, and resistance from communities.  Same thing in Boston.  When I was in Grad school they were trying to improve the subway there and kept running up against communities not wanting an expansion.  It is also interesting that when they do surveys in places like LA, Atlanta, and Dallas about if Public Transit is a good idea they overwhelming say yes.  Then when they ask if they personally will use it, they overwhelmingly say no.",1,1

In theory, a new bus line could be created the same day a bus is purchased.

WQyiY5qC_us,"The Mcu is a cinematic universe in name only. If you look at all the individual movies there is actually very little continuity. For example at the end of Ironman 3 , Stark is no longer Ironman and has had the arc generator removed. Skip to Avengers 2, he's ironman again with no explanation. Avengers 1 coleson is dead, on television he is alive yet remains dead to the movies.",0,0
WQyiY5qC_us,"SOOO its a problem that they wanna do more standalone movies that aren't heavily tied to the larger universe. SMH  I didn't like SS & BVS was okay but WB is trying everything to fix their films. SMH ScreenJunkies stop jumping the gun, if you read the article it says they‚Äôre still doing a shared universe....but they‚Äôre letting each film be it‚Äôs own film. There not backtracking their making a different adjustment moving foward.",0,0
WQyiY5qC_us,"It's andy that doesn't know what he's talking about, it's clear what the statement means, they're saying it's still a shared universe but they're not gonna feel pressured to crossover with other films every film, in my book they shouldn't crossover except during JL movies or when it's warranted, i've been hoping for this",0,0

WQyiY5qC_us,So they'll just treat the movies like they used to treat comics: individual stories that share the same universe and occasionally crossover characters. The fact that they were making the main movies (man of steal and bvs and therefore justice league) like sequels instead of their own thing was a bad idea.,0,0

WQyiY5qC_us,Its hard out there for all the pimps\n- Roth 2017,2,0
WQyiY5qC_us,"A connected universe seems pretty simple from the outside...basically MCU has a lot of standalone superhero movies ( that kinda all tell the superhero journey - personally not boring for me ) with different writers that all tell their cinematic vision. Then they make team up movies that are actually standalone movies as well. Most of the team ups don't really require for you to watch all the other movies to enjoy ( so far). But it could be more complicated, and the DCEU could find a completely new formula that works for them. I think after the Flash movies and introducing the malleable timeline it would be easier for them to tell stories, retcon and interconnect movies. It would be a shame to completely disregard team-ups, mostly because they can be fun if you find a formula that works for the audience.\\n There is a lot of criticism for Marvel and the fact that they  control the content of the movies a little too much ( to the detriment of the director vision ) , so we don't actually know how much of a mastermind Kevin Feige is, or who pulls the strings how, so things could actually be more complicated for the MCU as well.",1,0

WQyiY5qC_us,"It's not about the stars. Chris Evens, Hemsworth, Pratt, Downey Jr, are not why marvel studios' films are popular. The films are popular because they are well made. And entertaining.

PD7OWHNAUqY,"I think these explorations are interesting and necessary for art. I've been in galleries full of renaissance paintings and  i see people of all generations with their phones and DSLRs going painting to painting, photographing it only ever looking through the screen or viewfinder. I've experienced installation art where groups of people have clearly dressed up and are taking unlimited selfies and group photos, only pausing to take in the art when people stare them down for too long and they realize they are embarrassing themselves. While yes this behaviour is narcissistic and disrespectful, artists never had and never will have control over how people respond to their work. I think this gallery sees this behaviour and is responding to it. If people are going to turn art galleries into selfie spaces, why not design experiences around it. Art doesn't not control the masses, art responds to the behaviour of the masses. Thats what this gallery is doing. Highbrow art or lowbrow art, people will find a way to take a selfie with it. If you've got a problem with it, then you should be pointing fingers at the tech corporations that are actually making bank on peoples selfies.

As I said at the start, art sometimes is not beautiful, or happy, here they clearly said they strive for perfect lighting for a photo it's about you showing others you are at this place. While another actual museums art work can make you think of others and how you can help or how you have hurt. Other actual art talks about being gay, black , Hispanic, raped, and politics, and love. It wants to address issues that need fixing. This place brings nothing like that to its visitors. It is an escape, sure.

I think they should have hired a curator or publicist to talk about this properly than saying it's a site that looks cool and instagramable. What Jordan Ferney and Maryellis Bunn talk about is what made people accept modernism (more or less). It's the bauhaus' metaphoric honesty and the truth to material that perceptually lacks here whilst the whole thing is just a decor for instagram. By aligning ideas of instagram, brand and a product words that are not far reaching from superficiality, falsehood and lies, it creates a deceit of the original purpose of art form. \\n\\nlol if that's the case it's pretty much what john ruskin talks about in one of his essays.",0,0

WQyiY5qC_us,"A connected universe seems pretty simple from the outside...basically MCU has a lot of standalone superhero movies ( that kinda all tell the superhero journey - personally not boring for me ) with different writers that all tell their cinematic vision. Then they make team up movies that are actually standalone movies as well. Most of the team ups don't really require for you to watch all the other movies to enjoy ( so far). But it could be more complicated, and the DCEU could find a completely new formula that works for them. I think after the Flash movies and introducing the malleable timeline it would be easier for them to tell stories, retcon and interconnect movies. It would be a shame to completely disregard team-ups, mostly because they can be fun if you find a formula that works for the audience.\\n There is a lot of criticism for Marvel and the fact that they  control the content of the movies a little too much ( to the detriment of the director vision ) , so we don't actually know how much of a mastermind Kevin Feige is, or who pulls the strings how, so things could actually be more complicated for the MCU as well.",1,0

WQyiY5qC_us,"I think DC was behind the 8-ball from the very beginning. Lets start off with the tone, by sticking with the more sullen tone of the Snider films it really sapped the joy out of Superman, a character who is supposed to embody the sense of optimism and hope. Sure batman works as a brooding anti-hero but the man of steel? So already they made a bad decision to not only continue the snider feeling with Superman in Batman V Superman they also seems to have just painted the whole universe with that brush. Secondly they were late to the party, they saw the success of Marvel and its cinematic universe and decided to jump in and fast track their schedule so they could compete with Marvel. Problem is that Marvel has spent years creating their universe, all the way back with Iron Man in 2008. \\n\\nSo by playing fast and loose with their universe building they made huge mistakes, biggest mistake of all is wasting Doomsday in BvS. Anyone that was reading DC in the 90s knows that the Doomsday storyline was a huge event. You had a seemingly unstoppable monster who single-handedly (literally cause he only was using one arm) completely wrecked the JLA and it took Superman literally fighting him to the death in order to stop him. The ensuing funeral and the impostor supermen story line continued to the Return of Superman, the destruction of Coast City, Hal Jordan going mad and destroying the Green lantern corps and becoming Parallax.\\n\\nYou would think that an event that started off that long chain of events would be considered prime to be a massive cinematic event on par with the Infinity Gauntlet movies with Marvel. But instead they were like Well we need someone for Batman and Superman to fight in the end... well there was this character doomsday who was big in the 90s... lets use him. To me it felt like shades of Batman and Robin with them just tacking on Bane to the movie as a glorified bodyguard for Poison Ivy.",1,2

I paired it with some butternut squash I roasted in dill and pepper. Thanks Chef John!",0,0

Hemp can make four times more paper per acre than trees. Hemp can also make biodegradable plastic. The legalization of marijuana will allow fields of industrial hemp to replace trees for paper, and petrochemicals for plastic, thereby ending deforestation and reducing pollution.\\n\\nPlease watch the 1942 US Department of Agriculture film, Hemp For Victory, and tell your national audience.

uoTIcwHK_aw,"hey Jaden/internet I have a similar tale which I will like to tell.\\n\\nOnce in year two. We were leaving this tiny hill area witch was this sort of play zone and somehow I was singled out until all that was left was me and three other kids. Two of them were just standing around to watch the fireworks of what was about to go on and there was one kid who I am going to call Sam. Sam was the school bully in my year level and a pretty tough kid. Anyway I was standing by a tree and he came rushing at me so I picked up a stick and jabbed in his detection. what must have happened is it scratched next to his eye. He then started crying and lightly punching me. THEN my bully smarts kicked in all if you ignore him the problem will go away thanks brain, thanks. \\n\\nSo I began walking to my class and to my relief he quickly stopped and wandered off. So I just went back to class. I can't remember much after that but later I was called to the deputy principles office ad I freaked out but I internalized (hopefully) then went to his office. The deputy principle was this serious sporty guy who looked sullen 95% of the time. I sat in a chair in front of him and he said something along the lines of Sam told us you stabbed him in the eye with a stick, is this true?.\\n\\nThankfully the devious part of me just when 'hold up, I got this' then I said to the DP I was standing still holding a stick and he ran into it. and they bought it. Entirely! It must have helped that I was the teachers pet of the school with a little halo (of lies).\\nSam never bothered me from then on and I haven't told a single soul the truth of what happened that day, until now, I have told the internet... yeah...",0,0

They cant make a copy and paste repeat of a MCU movie . This is DC , they had to stand out and I think they did it . DC characters and movies have way more heart and soul than Marvel movies. Marvel movies on the other hand ( except GotG) are all from the same formulae . Introduce 'regular guy'  who is a 'meany' , he/she learns humility and becomes a 'good guy ' incomes 'bad guy' , 'good guy' kills 'bad guy ' .

WQyiY5qC_us,"Andy you are so biased, you contradict yourself so much. You say they've done some great movies with Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman then say you don't understand how they can't nail these characters at WB. Well you said it yourself they have done. Then you say they need optimism in Justice League and you can't see how they can do that. However you then say well The Flash , Aquaman and Wonder Woman may bring that. Guess what you named half the league.\\n\\nListen guys as you say in sports, your only as good as your last game, well guess what Wonder Woman was a success all round but you always revert to MOS and BVS and gloss over Wonder Woman. The DC movies have no chance if you guys have this preconceived negative idea. From your video it appears you have made a decision on JL and stop saying you want it to succeed because if you did you wouldn't be so negative and biased with your opinion.\\n\\nFurthermore I read that vulture article and that too, I an editorial with a negative agenda to tarnish Zack Snyder.",0,0
WQyiY5qC_us,"Love the video, but I think you guys missed the point on the article. The DC universe is still very much connected, just every movie will be its own movie instead of a set up film which we all can admit can be a problem with some films.

WQyiY5qC_us,I disagree with Andy. Dc/wb should wait for flash point. They can still turn this around.,0,0

WQyiY5qC_us,"Two major differences between MCU and DCU: 1) casting. Marvel has simply invested in far superior actors for their main roles. 2) tone. Marvel is fun. DC is dark, brooding, etc. Want people to come out to watch all 10+ movies in a cinematic universe: be fun!",1,0
WQyiY5qC_us,"I see this as how comics are. We have A Batman Comic, A Detective comic, A Superman comic and A Trinity comic.  The batman comic and the superman comic are there own thing, with there own story but there still taking place in the same universe, then you have trinity witch takes batman, wonder woman and superman and put them in together for A story and will sometimes drop hits to these other story's they were in. I think this will work best.",2,0
WQyiY5qC_us,"A connected universe seems pretty simple from the outside...basically MCU has a lot of standalone superhero movies ( that kinda all tell the superhero journey - personally not boring for me ) with different writers that all tell their cinematic vision. Then they make team up movies that are actually standalone movies as well. Most of the team ups don't really require for you to watch all the other movies to enjoy ( so far). But it could be more complicated, and the DCEU could find a completely new formula that works for them. I think after the Flash movies and introducing the malleable timeline it would be easier for them to tell stories, retcon and interconnect movies. It would be a shame to completely disregard team-ups, mostly because they can be fun if you find a formula that works for the audience.\\n There is a lot of criticism for Marvel and the fact that they  control the content of the movies a little too much ( to the detriment of the director vision ) , so we don't actually know how much of a mastermind Kevin Feige is, or who pulls the strings how, so things could actually be more complicated for the MCU as well.",1,0

You say they've done some great movies with Batman, Wonder Woman and Superman then say you don't understand how they can't nail these characters at WB. Well you said it yourself they have done. Then you say they need optimism in Justice League and you can't see how they can do that. However you then say well The Flash , Aquaman and Wonder Woman may bring that. Guess what you named half the league.\\n\\nListen guys as you say in sports, your only as good as your last game, well guess what Wonder Woman was a success all round but you always revert to MOS and BVS and gloss over Wonder Woman. The DC movies have no chance if you guys have this preconceived negative idea. From your video it appears you have made a decision on JL and stop saying you want it to succeed because if you did you wouldn't be so negative and biased with your opinion.\\n\\nFurthermore I read that vulture article and that too, I an editorial with a negative agenda to tarnish Zack Snyder.",0,0
WQyiY5qC_us,"Love the video, but I think you guys missed the point on the article.

I think this will work best.",2,0
WQyiY5qC_us,"A connected universe seems pretty simple from the outside...basically MCU has a lot of standalone superhero movies ( that kinda all tell the superhero journey - personally not boring for me ) with different writers that all tell their cinematic vision. Then they make team up movies that are actually standalone movies as well. Most of the team ups don't really require for you to watch all the other movies to enjoy ( so far). But it could be more complicated, and the DCEU could find a completely new formula that works for them. I think after the Flash movies and introducing the malleable timeline it would be easier for them to tell stories, retcon and interconnect movies. It would be a shame to completely disregard team-ups, mostly because they can be fun if you find a formula that works for the audience.\\n There is a lot of criticism for Marvel and the fact that they  control the content of the movies a little too much ( to the detriment of the director vision ) , so we don't actually know how much of a mastermind Kevin Feige is, or who pulls the strings how, so things could actually be more complicated for the MCU as well.",1,0

Exploit your body for money, date as many rappers as you can snag, don't forget to have a baby so you can keep those checks coming and solidify that rich life style. What Black Chyna did to Rob was horrible, but we're holding street rally's for women that have no legit talent other than the fact that they are esthetically pleasing to the eye, and  because men want to have sex. Beauty and Sex is a talent?  Is being morally dead a career option? Forget College,  let's all get the fat sucked out of our stomachs and put in our asses, snag a rapper, and get a few endorsements so we can try to conceal the fact that  we are sluts. Just would like to know how big of a Slut does one have to be before we're allowed to acknowledge the problem, or is acknowledging that a person  has piss poor morals and ethics a form of bullying?

I actually endured the same exact problem on my main channel until my friend hooked me up with her promotion service on Fiverr. She wanted to test her promotion strategies on my videos and NOW my main channel virtually exploded after that. The girl advertised my video in front of millions of people and now I have thousands of views, subscribers, and comments because she brought the right traffic that we needed for my particular channel and content. I actually want you to grow and get the views that you deserve, so I'd suggest you look into a promotion service like hers. {This is actually in the bottom right corner of my YouTube banner (not allowed to post links in the comment section).\\n\\nMy main channel is also displayed on my channel, so you can see for yourself, if you don't believe me. I also have the link to her promotion service posted in the bottom right of the channel banner on my new main channel as well.\\n\\nPlease keep working on your channel!

Nothing to do with Trump ,it was ALL ''in the head of the killer'' ! Don't make this incident  into anything more than it actually was!  A deluded deranged U.S. citizen who must have been full of rage and mentally ill, decided to take out his anger and frustration on innocent people, and by the way he did that he possibly was trying t!o become ''famous'' for his killing spree and the huge numbers of injured. This tragedy was ''all about the killer, in his own mind, to make him become a headliner in the news and famous for years for his horrific slaughter of innocents. Glad he is NOW DEAD ! So there will be NO trial, his face won't be on front page of newspapers and on Television news for weeks on end.He is just gone! Can't be interviewed, hopefully no book written about him.

AzWiUQEdJOo,"What can I do?  \\n\\nAccording to the experts you should:\\n1. Garden with sustainable agriculture techniques (less pesticides and fertilizer (organic or better yet permaculture)).\\n2. Buy food and manufactured goods made locally\\n3. Pay down debt\\n4. Learn skills they will be useful in the future and make friends that have useful skills you don't have (related to providing food, water, shelter, and medical care.  A necessary skill is organic/permaculture gardening/farming).  Very important: medical skills are the best way to ensure your survival.   All others will gladly sacrifice their life to protect your life, so you are around to use your medical knowledge to keep their  families alive.\\n5. I recommend to invest some money into technologies to increase the carrying capacity of the planet (high risk investments);\\nA. decrease environmental impact per capital \\nB. alternatives for our food system input to improve production\\nC. alternatives to our current living arrangements, \\nD. alternatives to our plastics industry, \\nE. alternatives to disaster capitalism\\nF. Savior technologies, ie faster-than-light travel, game changer technologies, ie Cold fusion energy & delaying technologies, ie deep drilling technologies.\\n6. I also recommend you inform and prepare your family, friends, and others.  It is best to initially suggest people have an emergency kit... for any emergency such as flood, earthquake, tornado, hurricane, loss of electricity due to a winter storm.  Then, if the friend or relative puts together a disaster kit, what I do is introduce Peak Oil (by telling them of the 43 second movie trailer http://m.natgeotv.com/ca/2210-thecollapse/videos/collapse-of-earth  , the National Geographic Collapse movie on YouTube, & free book downloads;\\n7. For the truly motivated, a community based organization to mitigate Climate Change and Peak Oil is: http://www.transitionus.org/\\n(For non USA; https://transitionnetwork.org/)\\n\\nGoogle 2052 free book summary download, &\\n\\nThe free book Plan C workbook download; http://www.communitysolution.org/newsolutionsreports/new-solutions-11-plan-c-curtailment-and-community?rq=plan%20c\\n\\nSee the Facebook page: National Geographic Collapse movie",0,0

You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet.

We have a thousand homegrown problems right now to deal with we do NOT need more from people outside the country, particularly those that do not have the proper higher level education and skills.  Maybe if the level of illegal immigration wasn't so high we could afford to relax the legal immigration laws, but that will only happen when we actually put in effective, permanent measures to reduce illegal immigration. Immigration to the United States isn't a right, it's a privilege, afforded to those who have the necessary skills that allow them to improve our country, and that IS the way it should be. \\n\\nWe are NOT the dumpster of all the rest of the worlds trash. If a country is in a dire situation and we accept refugees from it, fine, but that consideration should be temporary, with the expectation of returning those immigrants to their country of origin once the situation there is less volatile.  \\n\\nIt's alright to have sympathy, but don't let sympathy blind you to the realities of this world.",0,0

This video can be seen as pro immigration, but at the same time against the system in place to prevent illegal immigration. Will people agree to what we already know is a good thing? Immigration IS great, but I honestly think people will get the wrong message and be more incline to dislike the fact that the ways to get here legally are tough. My parents went through the system, so when I read about how great someone did, and is an illegal citizen, it just aggravates me a little. Why would they have more of a right than my folks to be here?",0,0
v-eLrAw-gGc,"Just because someone wants to come to the US doesn't mean it should be easy. If the US feels it needs more workers, it will loosen its standards to accept the people it needs. There are countless other countries people can move to. We shouldn't feel sorry for people because it is hard to get in. If you want to leave your home country, then you must accept the requirements of the country you want to go to or find another country. Harvard doesn't feel sorry that it can't accept every student who wants to get in. Google doesn't feel sorry that it doesn't accept every employee wants to work there, and the US shouldn't feel sorry for every foreigner who wants to move here. Sometimes you have to apply to different schools, employers, and countries. I don't think the immigration system is broken for US citizens.

C1wa2OyP_so,"Here are a few things here I think are important and cool about Gibraltar:\\n- Gibraltar is one of the last territories that the UN considers a colony in the world. Gibraltar in this video is shown to be an entity Britain would give up and give back to Spain, but the residents and government of Gibraltar want to be entirely independent of both countries and be their own sovereign nation. \\n-Gibraltar is entirely self-sufficient economically and they actually end most years with a surplus\\n-Gibraltar is not just English and Spanish. Because of the small populace, minorities have a substantial impact on the culture. These include a large Indian community as well as the second largest population of Jews per capita in the world\\n-Going off the previous point, many people from Gibraltar speak Llanito, a hybrid of Spanish and English with many words and phrases from Hebrew/Yiddish and Hindi mixed in.",0,0

KbYCmEptlL8,"ATTENTION :\\n\\nThe Beast System is the Church System... All Church's,Any Denomination, They all are part of the beast system. Pastors feed sheep polluted bread so they continue to look for spiritual highs.. THE PATH IS NARROW AND VERY FEW PEOPLE FIND IT!THE STRONG DELUSION THAT GOD SENDS IS SUNDAY CHURCH SERVICE, AS WELL AS THE PRIDE OF LIFE.PEOPLE WOULD RATHER LISTEN TO THEIR PASTOR THEN LISTEN TO GOD. EVERLEARNING IN CHURCH INSTITUTIONS AND NEVER KNOWING JESUS. NEVER HEARING THE FATHER VOICE.Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons DIDNT WE ATTEND CHURCH but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven.REPENTANCE,OBEDIENCE AND LOVE ARE THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN. THE CHURCH SYSTEM ANY CHURCH IS A LIE. THE CHURCH IS SCATTERED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD THEY ARE NOT IN THE INSTITUTIONS. GOD WANTS US TO OBEY HIS COMMANDS!!!

Just a few things though: \\n\\nYou've made a suguaro cactus, which are super common in lower Arizona, northern Mexico, and just barely southern California. The flowers are *white* and bloom every summer to almost any age of cactus that has an arm (they grow one arm every ten years, and live to be 100+ years).\\n\\nI'd really appreciate if you could do another suguaro, but with white flowers because that's their colour. \\n\\nIf you wanted to keep the pink flowers, prickly pear cacti have yellow flowers and barrel cacti have pinkish orange flowers.",0,1

OWAf0pD8354,Where do you plug into the SNES? Like what cable is necessary to connect from the computer to the console?,0,1
OWAf0pD8354,"It works, it's awesome, the weird thing I get is that if I turn off the snes mini at the menu screen I get a c8 error...but if I turn it off during a game....it turns off fine. Reflashed original, flashed custom, tried it again and still get c8 error. Works for me, which is great, still but minor nuisance.",0,1
OWAf0pD8354,Please note (best to my knowledge) that the EU PAL edition of the SNES Mini also came with USA installed games. There are no EU Pal games on the system. I guess thats because the EU games ran at 50hz and had those letterbox borders on them.,0,3
OWAf0pD8354,Will I lose my current saves or does it keep the original games and saves when adding new ones?,2,8

It's all about what you're used to and what your society is used to. Euro-American and African-Americans aren't accustomed to East Asian names, unfortunately. The good news is that by having a name true to your heritage you are helping many people learn how to pronounce them. Hopefully one day it wont be a problem for our culture. Also, whiteness is a construct of white supremacy and by using he term you're conforming to racist ideology. So called white names can better be described as Judeo-Christian names, Anglo, German, Euro-American, or any of their ethnic origins. Whiteness and all it's manifestations are constructs our society(USA) must abandon before we progress. .",0,0

I did it all correct but when they were in the over, they baked nicely so far, that round top was rising perfectly but some of them cracked on top and the worse, THE FEET of them didn't show up, i took them out and tried them, they didn't taste bad, they tasted like macarons, the texture was fine I think, but they weren't macarons üò≠ I made 4 batches bc there was a lot of batter and I didn't want to throw away.

I did it all correct but when they were in the over, they baked nicely so far, that round top was rising perfectly but some of them cracked on top and the worse, THE FEET of them didn't show up, i took them out and tried them, they didn't taste bad, they tasted like macarons, the texture was fine I think, but they weren't macarons üò≠ I made 4 batches bc there was a lot of batter and I didn't want to throw away.

11S5tcT2Tm0,"For those crying cultural appropriation in the comments:\\n\\nThe proper definition of cultural appropriation is claiming a culture of which you're not a part to be your own. I'll use myself as an example. I'm German, so I celebrate German culture. If someone who isn't German likes the culture and decides to partake in something like, let's say, Oktoberfest, but doesn't claim that s/he is German, I have no problem with that. But if that same person claims to be German, when in fact, s/he is Portuguese, then that would start rustling my jimmies.\\n\\nNow, I know some might say, But you're European. You did that all the time and still do that. I'll include a better example. I play the didgeridoo, an instrument played by Australian Aborigines. I'm not claiming to be Aboriginal, I just appreciate the didgeridoo for what it is. But if I was claiming to be Aboriginal, that would make me a jerk. And nobody likes a jerk.\\n\\nIf anything, what Lindsey's doing here is cultural appreciation. She's not claiming to be Indian, she's drawing inspiration from Hindu culture for this song/video. If all of her songs were like this, then yeah. That'd be offensive. But this is one song off of one of three albums. \\n\\nSo please. Chill out. Have some popcorn. Just calm down.",0,0

You cant say we treat them bad, we give them free health care in OUR HOSPITALS, FREE EDUCATION IN OUR SCHOOLS. Go to a maternity and you will see that for every dominican giving birth are 20 haitians. Most of them hate dominicans, most of them disrespect OUR FLAG, most of the disrespect OUR ANTHEM. We had help them a lot unconditionally, They are part of our economy but we can‚Äôt carry them we are poor too. So people from VOX should delete this propaganda against DOMINICAN REPUBLIC.",0,0

4WvKeYuwifc,"Not only is your video misleading and simplifying a situation that shows here you don't even begin to understand. Historical facts are missing from your research (I would really like to read your sources). And is even more saddening that people watch a video and pretend to be experts in a two-nations complex situation. It is more saddening that the biases showed in this video are just promoting more prejudice and division. And obviously the author and very few of the readers should be asking, who mishandled the money from Haiti's earthquake recovery? (same international agencies that accuse a whole country of racism), but which country is the one that provided the most immediate help and assistance (real help, hands on) (Yes, the DR) But that does not sell news and youtube likes.

I worked for a company based in DR that was planting moringa trees in Haiti and trying to teach them how to grow their own crops and all they got was negativity to say the least, and very little people wanted to even know about it, you can't teach those who are more comfortable talking about problems instead of actually doing something about it. You can take a horse to the river but you can't make him drink.

4WvKeYuwifc,"This is a very very complex subject that expands for hundreds of years. I think that 15 minutes it's not enough to understand the whole thing. I recommend that the people interested in this subject make some more research if this video is the only thing you have seen about this subject. There are some big pieces of information missing like the fact that Dominican Republic had to fight for its independence from Haiti (like other commenter said).\\n\\nI think that this video is biased in favor of Haiti. I also have to admit that I'm biased in favor of Dominican Republic, because thats my country, were I've live all my life, from were I'm writing right now. I think that it's true that there is racism in Dominican Republic, against black people from any part of the world, including black Dominicans. I think that is true that we have xenophobia against Haitians. We also have machismo and homophobia and lots of other problems in various degrees spread in the population. But so does any other country in the world, included Haiti. Thats not an excuse, a lot of people here in DR fight against those problems, I do. But I also think that as a free and independent country we should have a better control of our frontier. Of course paying the right respect to our brothers Haitians. That said, in general most of the Dominicans live in peace with Haitians, even knowing if they have or don't have papers and with black people, Dominican Republic have a lot of black people as you could saw on the video.\\n\\nBut we are also a poor country, our GDP that looks good for our small country is badly administrated and badly distributed. We have a lot of corruption too and part of that corruption is reflected on the way the frontier is administrated. The little bit of resources that really get to our hospitals have to be shared with Haitian womans who come here just to give birth, and they get the attention, for free. That is why they keep coming. But the thing is that Dominicans have to take care of Dominicans first, and all the problems we have, in health, in education, in nutrition, we don't even have an electric system that works completely all the time, shut-downs are normal here, except for a few special neighborhoods in the capital. We help Haiti as much as we can because after all they are our brothers. I've even said some times that the people from the United States have made us far worst things than the Haitians (2 invasions, lots of political issues, bad influence), so we should be more careful with gringos than with our brothers Haitians that have even helped us at some battles.",0,0

4WvKeYuwifc,"This could have been a great video if it also showed the history on the Dominican Republics side. Haiti also invaded D.R and  treated Dominicans badly during that time under their ruling which is something that still  hits a nerve with many Dominicans since we had to gain our independence from Haitian rule.  It's sad to see how Haiti which had so much potential (former slave colony gain its independence) end up this way. The UN presence in Haiti, the earthquake, the STILL ONGOING EFFECTS OF CHOLERA WHICH WERE BROUGHT BY UN these are just a few of the many things that Haiti has had to endure. Sadly what this video did capture is the racism that is experienced by Haitians from Dominicans. And for those commenting about how thats not the case, how there isnt racist towards Haitians for being black then you are kidding yourself.  Over all i really wish both sides were cast with the same light since i feel this was very biased towards Dominican Republic.",0,0
4WvKeYuwifc,"Please do more research. Review some statistics and studies made on both countries before showing a whole country as racist.

The Dominican Republic has most (if not a quite sizable amount) of its citizens living in poverty.¬†\\n\\n2. ¬†‚ÄúStable‚Äù\\n\\nWhen it comes to elections, yes, ¬†there is a political cycle. But, corruption is high (a scandal concerning a Brazilian company might ring a bell).¬†\\n\\n3. ‚ÄúDominican Market‚Äù/‚ÄúBoarder Market‚Äù\\n\\nAt the beginning, they are going to a ‚ÄúDominican Market.‚Äù Then, it turns into a ‚Äúboarder market‚Äù on the side of the Dominican Republic. ¬†They should have been going to a ‚Äúboarder market‚Äù from the start.¬†\\n\\n4. Migration\\n\\nMany children (perhaps in the thousands) have no birth certificate, and that goes for both sides of the island. ¬†You are undocumented in your own land.¬†\\n\\nI can go on. Yes, There is racial profiling and animosity . But, you have to understand that the Dominican Republic fought its war of independence against Haiti (not Spain).

I did it all correct but when they were in the over, they baked nicely so far, that round top was rising perfectly but some of them cracked on top and the worse, THE FEET of them didn't show up, i took them out and tried them, they didn't taste bad, they tasted like macarons, the texture was fine I think, but they weren't macarons üò≠ I made 4 batches bc there was a lot of batter and I didn't want to throw away.

A bunch of people having stupid childish drama but they're all old enough to know better. A bunch of morons standing around on street corners with blank looks on their faces. Nobody cares about this. You only got like 8000 views. and who's sensationalizing the south side of Chicago? Nobody gives a sht about it. People are ignoring it.

Culture is a way bigger factor here people. First off, you missed a huge part of the historical narrative in that Haiti colonized the DR and DR fought their war of independence against Haiti. Talk about a glaring omission. Yes, DR is probably racist and the French were jerks, but Haiti is poor because of internal problems, a broken culture chief amongst them.

This law establishes soil (birth) and blood (parents), as the base for citizenship....not so, the children of diplomats and people in transit. \\n\\nThe 2013 cour decision clarifies what ‚Äúin transit‚Äù means, and for the court a person that is illegally in the country is ‚Äúin transit‚Äù. This meant that thousands of Dominicans that were born in the country to illegal parents, lost their citizenship instantly. The executive branch was then trapped by this decision, and decided to via an executive order give citizenship to all these people, about 60,000 in total.\\n\\nThe 200,000 the video mention is a different group. These are Haitians, born in Haiti, that reside illegaly in DR. The ‚Äúregularization‚Äù process described is actually an large amnesty given by the Dominican gov. to anyone who can prove it has a job in the country. This process of amnesty was set for a year deadline, but was recently extended due to lack of documents issued by Haiti to its citizens.\\n\\nIt is true that there is a lot of racism in DR, and we can argue the historical and cultural roots of that.....but the legal analysis in this video is wrong!",0,0

I did it all correct but when they were in the over, they baked nicely so far, that round top was rising perfectly but some of them cracked on top and the worse, THE FEET of them didn't show up, i took them out and tried them, they didn't taste bad, they tasted like macarons, the texture was fine I think, but they weren't macarons üò≠ I made 4 batches bc there was a lot of batter and I didn't want to throw away.

nceSvKBjp5g,This show is going to flop. This ain't 1995. Nobody thinks this hood life is all exciting anymore. This looks boring as fk. A bunch of people having stupid childish drama but they're all old enough to know better. A bunch of morons standing around on street corners with blank looks on their faces. Nobody cares about this. You only got like 8000 views. and who's sensationalizing the south side of Chicago? Nobody gives a sht about it. People are ignoring it. Back in 1993 maybe everyone would be all oh damn that's so exciting Not today. You guys are boring. Yesterday's news.,8,5

The DR already has plenty of poverty to go around.",0,0
4WvKeYuwifc,"I found this video to be extremely one sided and the host (Johnny Harris) to be propagating untruthful myths about the relationship between the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Myth 1) Haiti is poor because of racism. Absolutely not true. Racism exist in the world but Haiti is poor because its leaders are corrupt and its people always play the victimization card which has led to years of aid that has only cause dependency and misery. Myth 2) Haiti is poor because the land was degraded in colonial times. Absolutely not true. Haiti shares a lust tropical island with the Dominican Republic, if the right forest and environment management programs are implemented the forest would grow back in 30 -40 years. Such a program was implement in the Dominican Republic in the 1970 and the forest came back (this is not a miracle, just planing and resource management). Myth 3) Haiti is poor because they are being exploited by Dominicans. Absolutely not true. Haitians come by the millions into the Dominican Republic looking for a better life, better education, better medical treatment and economic opportunities. They are paid a wage that is 10 times more than they pay in Haiti. They are making a smart decision  better to be exploited by a Dominican that pays ten times more that being exploited by a Haitian at home. Dominican are not against Haitians because they are black, it is more of an economic and culture issue. The Dominican Republic has the right to enforce its sovereign territory and manage it to provided the best standard of living for Dominicans. The Haitian people should start thing in the same way with there side of the island.",0,0

4WvKeYuwifc,"One important thing not mentioned here that was to a large degree the cause for Haiti's early isolation was the Haitian Massacre. The freshly self proclaimed Emperor of Haiti Jean-Jacques Dessalines in an effort to reinforce his rule instigated and lead a massacre of the white French population of Haiti (don't go racist and blame the population, blame the dictator).\\n\\nThis event allowed Southern politicians in the US to scaremonger against abolitionists and it turned the public opinion both in the US and in Britain against Haiti and in favor of France which in turn hoped to eventually regain rule over the colony one way or another. \\n\\nHaiti's early isolation was to a very large degree self inflicted, caused by a shortsighted maniac giving the racists and colonialists of his time fodder for propaganda.

4WvKeYuwifc,"I'm 28 years old Dominican and I was raised in an environment that look at Haitians as inferior. So there IS discrimination against Haitians. But the video here is totally biased, full of half-truths and only from the perspective of Haiti as victims. I love History, and as a Dominican I owed to myself to know the history of the region.  That being said, first, the wounds of war between Dominicans and Haitians healed over time to a point that both countries prospered and worked together until the period during the expansion of communism. In this period, USA took it upon itself to maintain their backyard free of Communism, even if that is to put Strong leaders to rule these countries and keep them on check.\\n\\nOne of these USA supported Dictators, Rafael Trujillo, was a Megalomaniac that have personal problems against Haitians. His politics of manipulating an entire country were similar to Hitler, that is to get the population an enemy to blame for all the bad things. He radicalized so much the Dominican population and promoted openly the hate that even evicted the Haitians living in the borders, event that led to The Parsley Massacre , the deaths are estimated to be as high as 35,000 Haitians and Haitian-Dominicans. This deeply corrupted sentiment of humanitarian failure continued as poor education and crooked government policies continued generation after generation. \\n\\nIn conclusion, I believe that victimizing Haiti and talking about discrimination before engrossing the whole truth and going deeper to both countries history and realizing that both countries have been victims and that both are wrong. We need videos that educate people and bring solutions, not videos that bring even more division. Both our countries suffer from this situation, let us not make it worse.",0,1

c_weoC3HT6Q,"(JESUS; THE ALMIGHTY!!!):\\n\\nAnd I saw heaven opened,\\nand behold a white horse; \\n\\nand he that sat upon him\\nwas called Faithful and True,\\n\\nand in righteousness \\nhe doth judge \\nand make war.\\n\\nHis eyes were as a flame of fire, \\n\\nand on his head were many crowns;\\n\\nand he had a name written, \\nthat no man knew, \\nbut he himself.\\n\\nAnd he was clothed with \\na vesture dipped in blood:\\n\\nand his name is called\\n\\nThe Word of God.\\n\\n(Revelation 19:11-13). \\n_________________________________________________\\n\\nBehold,\\n\\nhe cometh with clouds; \\nand every eye shall see him, \\n\\nand they also which pierced him:\\n\\nand all kindreds of the earth \\nshall wail because of him.\\nEven so, Amen.\\n\\nI am Alpha and Omega, \\nthe beginning and the ending, \\n\\nsaith the Lord,\\n\\nwhich is, \\nand which was, \\nand which is to come,\\n\\nthe Almighty.\\n\\n(Revelation 1:7-8). \\n________________________________________________\\n(JESUS):\\n\\nI am he that liveth,\\nand was dead;\\n\\nand, \\nbehold, \\n\\nI am alive for evermore, \\n\\nAmen;\\n\\nand have the keys \\nof hell \\nand of death.\\n\\n(Revelation 1:18). \\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(The world is going to hate us, because we follow Jesus. We follow and obey our Righteous King in our actions and deeds and the world hates us for it, because we don't form ourselves and obey the fallen king of this present world which is Satan):\\n\\n(Jesus):\\n\\nIf the world hates you,\\n\\nye know that\\nit hated me\\nbefore it hated you.\\n\\n(John 15:18).\\n\\n***(Hated Me): The world hated Him, so it should not be surprising that the world hates His followers.\\n\\n***(James 4:4)<---Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.\\n\\n***(1 John 2:15)<---Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\\n\\n***(Luke 6:26)<---Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Build your house with Jesus, on the rock, and you will never sink, that's (IF) we continue to Keep his Commandments, we will bear MUCH FRUIT!):\\n\\n(Jesus):\\n\\nAbide in me,\\nand I in you.\\n\\nAs the branch\\ncannot bear fruit of itself,\\nexcept it abide in the vine;\\n\\nno more can ye,\\nexcept ye abide in me.\\n\\n(John 15:4).\\n\\n***For the branch to produce more fruit, it must abide, which means to dwell, to stay, to settle in, to sink deeper. The way to abide in Christ is to OBEY.\\n\\n***(John 15:10)<---If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.\\n\\n***(1 John 3:24)<---And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.\\n\\n***The believer who lovingly OBEYS the Word of God produces much fruit.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Christ answers Philip, on himself and the Father as One. God manifested in the FLESH!):\\n\\nPhilip saith unto him, Lord,\\n\\nshew us the Father, \\nand it sufficeth us.\\n\\nJesus saith unto him,\\n\\nHave I been so long time with you, \\nand yet hast thou not known me, \\nPhilip?\\n\\nhe that hath seen me \\nhath seen the Father;\\n\\nand how sayest thou then, \\nShew us the Father?\\n\\nBelievest thou not that\\n\\nI am in the Father, \\nand the Father in me?\\n\\nthe words that I speak unto you \\nI speak not of myself:\\nbut (the Father)\\nthat (dwelleth) (in me),\\nhe doeth the works.\\n\\n(John 14:8-10).\\n\\n***(Revelation 21:3)<---And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the (tabernacle of God) is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and (God himself) shall be with them, and (be their God).\\n\\n***(Revelation 1:8)<---(Jesus)<----I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, (((the Almighty))).\\n\\n***The Lord rebuked Philip because he should have known the answer to the question he asked.\\n\\n***(He who has seen Me has seen the Father): The Lord patiently explained again that He was revealing God the Father to them in verse 7. It is impossible to escape the claim Jesus was making. Clearly, He was claiming to be God!\\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\\n\\nJesus said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\\n\\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\\nbut Jesus hid himself, \\nand went out of the temple,\\n\\ngoing through the midst of them, \\nand so passed by.\\n\\n(John 8:58-59).\\n\\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\\n\\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\\n\\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(I AM):\\n\\n(Gk. ego emimi);\\n\\n*(John 6:35)<---And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst).\\n*(John 10:7)<---Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep).\\n*(John 10:14)<---I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine).\\n*(John 15:1)<---I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman).\\n*(John 18:5)<---They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\\n\\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\\n\\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\\n\\nThen answered Jesus \\nand said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \\n\\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\\nfor what things soever he doeth, \\n\\nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\\n\\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\\n\\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \\nand sheweth him all things \\nthat himself doeth:\\n\\nand he will shew him \\ngreater works than these, \\nthat ye may marvel.\\n\\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\\n\\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \\nand quickeneth them; \\neven so the Son quickeneth \\nwhom he will.\\n\\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\\n(John 5:19-21).",0,0

EWng8GQ49Fg,"The Tri-Wizard Tournament is very similar, and arguably, based upon the idea of the elements of nature working together. With this being stated, because it is the Tri-Wizard Tournament, meaning three, this idea would mean that the number of elements of nature would not be four (fire, air, earth, water) but rather three. The concept of three natural elements (fire, air, and earth, with air consisting of water vapor and being basically the same thing) is based upon French Philosopher Ren√© Descartes. Though Descartes did live during the 17th century, when based upon Pottermore the Tri-Wizard Tournament [dates] back around 700 years, meaning the 14th century, perhaps this notion of three natural elements already was conceived by the Wizarding World. The Goblet of Fire represents the three elements: the fire from the goblet; the goblet made from materials of the earth; air that fuels the fire. The tasks of the 1994-1995 Tri-Wizard Tournament represent the three elements: Dragons breathe fire; the Lake (again, for Descartes, air and water are the same element); the Maze, which with its hedges and creatures represents earth. With regards to how each school transports its students, the same theory is able to be applied. Beauxbatons travels by air with their carriage. Though Durmstrang has a boat, it is in fact a vessel that is traveling upon the earth. Therefore, whatever Hogwarts uses to transport its students, my guess is that it is somehow related to the element of fire. The idea of Dragons seems a bit far-fetched, even if the Hogwarts school motto does mention a Sleeping Dragon. Nevertheless, my guess is that something in relation to the element of fire is how Hogwarts students are transported to the school hosting the Tri-Wizard Tournament.",0,0

Uh oh, all the traders are white, and none of them will land here to trade anymore.  I guess we f'ed up.  Now we're f'ed long term.  \\n\\nVOX.  Yes, slavery is bad but genocide is worse (even when it is against whites.)  The French debt of 1825 was bogus and would have been easy enough to ignore.  It was a desperate bid by an in-debt monarch ousted only five years afterwards.\\nWait until the initial ships leave and tear up any payment agreement.  France already had sold off its biggest colony in the New World with the Louisiana Purchase a few decades earlier.  The French only had a small presence in South America and had no bases from which they could invade Haiti and force payment.  By choosing to pay the bogus debt, Haiti was trying to buy friendship and trade.\\n\\nHowever, this is VOX. 6:00 and 7:00 . The genocide won't be mentioned.  Oh, according to VOX, it must have been white intolerance.  No, Haitians murdered people.  As a direct result, similar looking people stopped arriving to trade.

The regularization program was not about deportation was about giving this people that didn't have papers a temporary residents.  The government extended the time for foreigners the regularize their migration status but very. Few actually show up, many couldn't get the papers they needed because the hatian government is very disorganized.  There can not be racism in DR since almost all are population is mixed race, everyone has black in there blood, and proud of it. DR is also a very poor country but has better ecological policies that is why that side of the island is greener.

It goes much deeper than just race or color. You did not dwell sufficiently on the history between the two countries; nor did you mention that Haiti actually INVADED and occupied the DR for more than two decades.. There seems to be a trend with American journalists always pinning an entire issue or topic on RACISM as if that explains everything. All you did was smear the DR government and make them seem culpable for Haiti's dismal state. Haiti is the way it is because of it was a failed state from the very start. Plain and simple.

I'm Dominican and yes, there is racism and hate towards Haitians here in the DR, and yes, the Dominican government hasn't dealt with the situation in a correct way at all. Our government is very corrupt and only does something when they can benefit personally from it. Those decisions to deport Haitians born in the DR doesn't represent our country at all, it's just a way for the government to get rid of a 'problem' instead of dealing with it. Their logic goes like this: We have many poor people in our country so we shouldn't be dealing with Haiti's problems. Of course that's not right, but since our government really doesn't care about the poor in our own country, they try to lower the number of poor people by just deporting every Haitian they can. It's a way of hiding real problems and tricking the dominican people into thinking they're doing a good job.

4WvKeYuwifc,"Am Dominican and this was a pretty accurate documentary video. I just want to CLEAR a few things. DR is NOT Rich. We have become lately better off than some neighboring countries (like Venezuela, PR, Cuba and Haiti of course) mainly because of their current situations. We have become more stable and progressive, but There's still so much corruption (like the Odebrecht scandal), the low salaries, unemployment and delinquency... Also we are NOT so much racist (since the big MAJORITY of our population is also black. Even our guardsmen/military are mostly). But we are very *discriminating* of those with less resources... (Well not that different from the USA or EU then...)\\n\\n *CONCLUSIONS AND THINGS THAT NEED TO CHANGE* (Else this documentary will be forgotten like countless others...): Both countries need to lower their political corruption. Haiti needs help with its development from Rich / developed countries (FRANCE specially has an obligation and need to give the $ and resources they took back...). They need investment in education, recuperation of their land fertility, agriculture and Vegetation. BIRTH CONTROL (again mostly education). HEALTH care. Clean water, energy and transportation.\\n\\n *REMEMBER* Haiti can't do this alone. We all need to pitch in and get the ball rolling. A better Haiti also BECOMES a better DR (SPECIALLY since it stops becoming an economic burden) and the whole island can prosper! If both sides reach SIMILAR levels of development maybe it can become 1 single economy one day like the EU... But one side can't take the full burden or weight of the other side else neighter will stay afloat and both will end up drowning... üìâüíÄ(effectively both sides will then look more like haiti)...",0,0

4WvKeYuwifc,"completely misleading. It was not only\\nFrance that damaged haiti's environment; Haiti also did that to themselves. If you see the province of Dajabon(the Dominican province with more Haitians) on the map, on the Dominican side of the border, you would see how there are not many trees, just like haiti. They did it, not the french obviously because that is dominican territory. Despite being unfair based on that the border market places were built for equal trade between the two countries, those places were built by Dominicans in Dominican territory. Haitians are not liked in some parts of the dominican republic, but this documentary  does not talk about how the Dominican public hospitals spend sometimes more money on ilegal Haitian women than in Dominican citizens, they do not say how after Haiti's earthquake the Dominican Republic was the country that sent more resources to Haiti and how they did not even mention the Dominican Republic when they were thanking all the countries that helped. Also, many haitians are great people, but the truth is that a lot of haitians go to the Dominican republic to steal and sometimes even kill in order to steal. Those Haitians being pushed, hit and mobbed were actually thieves, they were not treated like that just because they were walking by, so it is very unfair and unprofessional to get those moments out of context to be used as proof of racism. One time crime might be acceptable, but after decades of having a foreign group of people harming your country, you get tired of that treatment. Many haitians that cross the border do it to get a better life, but sadly all the ones that go to the Dominican Republic to steal make the life in DR hard for the good ones. I grew up hearing haitians all over Santo Domingo talking about how they are going to take over the country soo. So, who has more hate? Who is racist? Who damages more the other?... I won't say one of both countries is the bad one, but there is no way this video can say it is the Dominicans",0,0

He mentioned how the cheaper labor of hatians, the illegal housing practices, their disregard for their border laws and more have led to many people in the DR becoming fed up with most hatians. They also spoke about how they have been pretty poor until really recently as they started allowing more and more foreign investments and that places like our hotel were amazing places to get a job because they are stable, friendly, give tips and can help them to afford an education. I was also amazed to find out that it's actually incredibly uncommon for someone to be 18 years old and not at least have one kid yet.

4WvKeYuwifc,"In the video you mentioned that France wanted a piece of this island because it was rich in sugar and coffee. Both coffee and sugar cane certainly did not exist in that Island before Europeans arrived. Coffee and sugar cane are not indigenous to the Americas. As a matter of fact, the first coffee crops in the Americas date from the 1700s while the French had already established a colony in what today is Haiti in the 1600s. While there's many reasons why French wanted a piece of the island I believe the colonial and territorial disputes between the European powers is probably one of the most important factors. The British also played a role in the process. The video is overall very good, but I feel you should have given more time  to explain how the French Revolution played a role in the beginning of Haiti's civil war. Now, if you're trying to explain why the two countries are so far apart from each other today you probably need to dive into the very discrepant educational indicators between Haiti and the DR rather than focus on racism.",0,1

42G_XzaPcPo,"God made that worm. And everything else. Even YOU! \\nThis world; Its ALL biblical. We are the last generation. Evil is rampant because Satan knows his time is coming to a close he is trying hard to drag all to hell with him. He's doing a fine job. People are all in a deep sleep and care only about being entertained trying to be famous and shopping in strip mall's and listening to terrible satanically inspired music etc. Its a Godless world and all will be totally surprised when Jesus comes and they get left to deal with Satan in reality with all his demons which instead of being invisible will be completely visible to the naked eye. Only then will people believe this world is all one giant spiritual battle. Jesus died for us, loves us, and wants us to escape hell which is an actual place. \\n\\nToss aside this temporary world. If you do not know Jesus Christ or believe in God, I urge you to start. Whether you believe or not does not change the fact that The One and Only Jesus Christ is on his way....shortly. Like days. How many? Not sure. But my spirit feels it. This world is messed up. You must admit that. Its all a lie...all the things you think make you happy are lies. The devil hates you and is laughing at you. Jesus loves you. He died for you and the entire world. Even if you don't  love him. He is waiting for you to receive him in your heart. If you are ready to receive Jesus into your heart pray this prayer before it's too late. This is an urgent warning. Pray: Jesus I am a sinner, I believe you died on the cross for me and my sins and rose from the dead. Please forgive me of all my sins I am repenting now and I ask you to enter my heart right now. Change me. I want to make you happy. I want to be happy and go to heaven. I do not want to be stuck in the tribulation. Help me to open my spiritual eyes and ears before you get here. I ask this in Jesus name Amen! \\n\\nIf you just prayed this prayer welcome to the family! You made the most important decision of your life right now. Don't stop praying and remember a prayer can be a simple as Jesus, help me!  now get a bible or an app and read about revelation. And read Matthew and John chapters. For a start. I pray you made the right decision and prayed that prayer. See you in heaven!üíõüíõüòòüëèüëçüòä \\n\\nTwitter: @YoNaturefreek",0,0

42G_XzaPcPo,Anyone else think it's kinda sad how they so readily pick up and displace one of the rarest animals they've ever encountered? When it was already perfectly positioned for amazing B roll and examination? And get their human scent all over it by handling it for such a long time? And also Coyote has no formal educational training in animal biology or entomology (his degree is in film from ohio state) ....idk maybe that's just me but i feel like we should respect wildlife instead of exploit it for Youtube views,2,3

7KbjNfCV-lY,I feel like these outfits were just various incarnations of Winona Ryder. Just one big Winona tribute (aka 1987),0,0
7KbjNfCV-lY,"I was 15 in 1987 living in Southern California.  Most people couldn't afford that leather outfit and it wasn't worn by many people.  It's more of a characterization.  Denim outfit was pretty close.  The off-colored patches in the acid wash were off.  And, most girls choose to rock big hair rather than wear hats.  Hats were worn by the mildly socially awkward, those more easily influenced by the 80s movie's interpretation of 80s style.    Your boyfriend's flock of seagulls hair style was about 5 years too old in 1987 and not many males wore it when it was popular.  Again, more of a characterization of 80s styles.  The metal hair was very spot on!!!  However, there were much better peacock style of feathering to the side, which was more preppy.  Some girls really had it going on.  Metal girls often had sloppy big hair.",0,0

EWng8GQ49Fg,"ok ok ok interesting i like your idea also i found this Hagrid says in the book that he never thought he'd live to see the Triwizard Tournament played again. However, the Tournament was supposed to be cancelled in 1792. This can be assumed to be another unsuccessful attempt to resurrect it.I found this on the wiki page and i then searched up when Hagrid was born, 1928 so that means somewhere between 1927 and 1944 there was a failed tournament.This leads me to think of two possibilities one the 1927 tournament went somewhat well and in five years or so they held another but it failed and they stopped hosting them or my second thought which would make much more sense for the movie Grindelwald attacks or sabotages the tournament and it is cancelled and then they never host it while Grindelwald is in power. now 1945 Grindelwald is imprisoned and the wizarding community says hurrah now we can celebrate so they host another but this time something goes wrong accidentally or it is sabotaged (secretly) by Tom Riddle now with a split soul as the wikipedia states ,The First Wizarding War[1] was a major conflict with foundations as early as the 1940s, and true indeed 1945 is in the 1940s. Anyway thats just some food for thought thanks for taking the time to read this.I wish you a good day a good week a good year and a good life.Byeeee",0,0

People shouldn't blame one party when there's a bunch of them involved.

4WvKeYuwifc,"Haiti executed virtually all white people in their territory shortly after independence.  It was actual genocide.  Uh oh, all the traders are white, and none of them will land here to trade anymore.  I guess we f'ed up.  Now we're f'ed long term.  \\n\\nVOX.  Yes, slavery is bad but genocide is worse (even when it is against whites.)  The French debt of 1825 was bogus and would have been easy enough to ignore.  It was a desperate bid by an in-debt monarch ousted only five years afterwards.\\nWait until the initial ships leave and tear up any payment agreement.  France already had sold off its biggest colony in the New World with the Louisiana Purchase a few decades earlier.  The French only had a small presence in South America and had no bases from which they could invade Haiti and force payment.  By choosing to pay the bogus debt, Haiti was trying to buy friendship and trade.\\n\\nHowever, this is VOX. 6:00 and 7:00 . The genocide won't be mentioned.  Oh, according to VOX, it must have been white intolerance.  No, Haitians murdered people.  As a direct result, similar looking people stopped arriving to trade. As for the more recent discrimination, the bulk of the Dominicans are mixed race.  It is mixed race people discriminating against darker black people.

Fertility of the soil is apparent, but why is it still a problem today? First world countries solved this issue nearly a 100 years ago. \\n2. The point that other surrounding countries isolated Haiti 'Because they were black' is lacking.

4WvKeYuwifc,"Great video in terms of editing and historical facts, but showing what happens only in Haiti's point of view seems like bias to me. I'm Dominican and yes, there is racism and hate towards Haitians here in the DR, and yes, the Dominican government hasn't dealt with the situation in a correct way at all. Our government is very corrupt and only does something when they can benefit personally from it. Those decisions to deport Haitians born in the DR doesn't represent our country at all, it's just a way for the government to get rid of a 'problem' instead of dealing with it. Their logic goes like this: We have many poor people in our country so we shouldn't be dealing with Haiti's problems. Of course that's not right, but since our government really doesn't care about the poor in our own country, they try to lower the number of poor people by just deporting every Haitian they can. It's a way of hiding real problems and tricking the dominican people into thinking they're doing a good job.

The government extended the time for foreigners the regularize their migration status but very. Few actually show up, many couldn't get the papers they needed because the hatian government is very disorganized.  There can not be racism in DR since almost all are population is mixed race, everyone has black in there blood, and proud of it.

4WvKeYuwifc,"Wow, I feel like this leaves us, Dominicans, as really bad and hostile against pople from Haiti and that is not the case. Yes, there is racism from Dominicans against Haitians, and some of those people don't even realize how racist they are. But most of us are totally ok with the coming over. The problem is that this immigration hasn't been properly regularized, wich lead us to having a really big population of undocumented residents. And any country has the power and autonomy to deport illegal immigrants, just as the United States does. Yes, they are treated really bad by guards on those markets, but Haitians that live in DR have a somewhat normal life, at least that's what I've seen. Also i think you left out the part of history when Haiti invaded us and claimed leadership over the whole island just after we went somewhat independent from Spain, and we had to fight a war to get independence again. Of course, that was almost 200 years ago, and nor Haitians nor Dominicans are the same people from those times, and therefore they're not to blame, but as you've said, these things helped shape our relationship, for good or bad. About that consitution thing, I agree, That should have been aplied to people that were already dominicans, and probaby just not at all. That was unfair. \\nAbout that part when they were checking documents on the bus: yes, that's racist, but It's because the immigration problem is with Haiti, not other countries. I really wish Haiti would get better, and their citicens didn't have to come here for necessity, but rather because they want to live here, because I'm sure not all these people wanted to live their country. I feel like racism is decreasing with the younger population, I hope this continuos to happen and we can have a beter relationship. After all, as different as we are, we have a similar history, we are humans,and we share this beautiful island.\\nAll that said, I'm going to take the ret of the Borders videos with a grain of salt, because even if you didn't inted to,you could end up portraying on side as really bad, and that not being the case.",0,0

He mentioned how the cheaper labor of hatians, the illegal housing practices, their disregard for their border laws and more have led to many people in the DR becoming fed up with most hatians. They also spoke about how they have been pretty poor until really recently as they started allowing more and more foreign investments and that places like our hotel were amazing places to get a job because they are stable, friendly, give tips and can help them to afford an education. I was also amazed to find out that it's actually incredibly uncommon for someone to be 18 years old and not at least have one kid yet.
