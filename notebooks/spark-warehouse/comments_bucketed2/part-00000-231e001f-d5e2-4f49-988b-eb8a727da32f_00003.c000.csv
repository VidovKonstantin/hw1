PHXkhUJWTXM,"First off, it is unfortunate that the local FEMA representatives responsible for emergency operations AND the local municipal government failed to have a qualified resource available to interpret, it seems to me that the problem is more of educating THEM on the importance of having qualified interpreting resources.  People sometimes think that when someone says:  Oh, I know sign language they are qualified to interpret (maybe all they know is finger spelling!  I give them credit for at least attempting to have someone there versus not having anyone at all.  This is of NO FAULT of Marshall's and he clearly did not state he was an interpreter in the first place.  Too many things happening in too short of a time for a critical natural disaster such as hurricane Harvey and hurricane Irma do not always allow organizations sufficient time to plan these things at the last minute -- that's why they should have agreements in place and interpreters included in ALL Emergency Management plans.  Don't trash the person who at least attempted to help, trash the people who don't understand they could have caused more damage than good by not having a qualified interpreter available.",1,0

PHXkhUJWTXM,"Gee, at least he can get SOME of the actual words right. I always wondered how accurate sign language was.  Spoken language is difficult enough for the human mind to grasp; how meaning can be conveyed with these crude signals as rapidly as speech is tough to believe. BTW, in Japanese signing, WHITE people were referred to by using an open OK type gesture around the eye, signifying round eyes.  It conveyed the intended meaning BUT it was later judged 'racist' and it was changed.  My Gawd.",1,3

After being through more than my share of counseling and therapy I can say this is one of what they call a Cognitive distortions. It's what happens when someone has a bad experience with one person, interaction or thing and associates that bad thing with the entire population. This can cause major problems if lets say someone gets rescued from the sex slave after being abused by a bunch of men, and after that they are deathly afraid of any grown man because they associate grown men with fear.

JO7X9ZPoAp8,"What's sad is when humanity thinks of beauty...Or attractiveness. We only think of the body. Our hair,  The pigment of our skin, How much makeup up you have. And completely forget that true beauty.....is something that is created from within. It is our soul, How we treat others and how we treat ourselves, It is the smile upon our face, The good things we have too say about Others. Its what you believe in and support. Thats what makes you beautiful. If you have a good heart and care of others and the world, Treat people how you want too be treated, Dont gossip or belittle about others, Stay away from negative drama and showing yourself respect. THAT is true beauty. You can live with demons and expect too go too heaven (If you believe in such things) I dont hold any religious beliefs or wish too change others. Just sharing my own personal perspective that we hold within",3,1
JO7X9ZPoAp8,"So many people in the comments were upset, and felt disillusioned because we blind people are‚Ä¶ people.\\nRight after saying how shallow the girl was, someone would call her ugly or not attractive. Or people would talk about the deformed eyes (which isn't how all blind people's eyes look, by the way). But, you aren't being hypocrites at all.\\nAnd why did you need this video to validate that inner beauty is important? If you don't actually believe it, or you find yourself thinking of the physical, why should blind people? We're all apart of the same society, affected by the same ideals.\\nScent, the way someone's arm feels, the sound of their voice are all things we notice. But in such a visual world, why wouldn't a blind person also wonder at someone's physical appearance? I ask my friends for basic descriptions so that I have an idea of what the person looks like, and then their opinion. Sighted people get their friends' opinions as well and it isn't seen as shallow. It's what you do once you've learned all you can, if you decide how you feel about someone on appearance alone, that determines the kind of person you are.\\nPS, someone said (I hope jokingly) that they expected them to say that beauty was black. If your fully blind, there is no blackness, or obstruction, it's just nothing. Think about the view behind your head, with only sound, touch, and scent to tell you what's happening. That's what a fully blind person sees. Though vision is on a scale, so blind may not mean fully/completely blind.",0,0

Please give him a break - he did his best, & it's a tough, high pressure situation to be in, especially on the spot.

PHXkhUJWTXM,"First off, it is unfortunate that the local FEMA representatives responsible for emergency operations AND the local municipal government failed to have a qualified resource available to interpret, it seems to me that the problem is more of educating THEM on the importance of having qualified interpreting resources.  People sometimes think that when someone says:  Oh, I know sign language they are qualified to interpret (maybe all they know is finger spelling!  I give them credit for at least attempting to have someone there versus not having anyone at all.  This is of NO FAULT of Marshall's and he clearly did not state he was an interpreter in the first place.  Too many things happening in too short of a time for a critical natural disaster such as hurricane Harvey and hurricane Irma do not always allow organizations sufficient time to plan these things at the last minute -- that's why they should have agreements in place and interpreters included in ALL Emergency Management plans.  Don't trash the person who at least attempted to help, trash the people who don't understand they could have caused more damage than good by not having a qualified interpreter available.",1,0

BTW, in Japanese signing, WHITE people were referred to by using an open OK type gesture around the eye, signifying round eyes.  It conveyed the intended meaning BUT it was later judged 'racist' and it was changed.  My Gawd.",1,3

When I got to the bathroom, I couldn't even unbutton my pants, the room was literally spinning. I peed all over the bathroom floor. The nausea in the film carried over to me. I had a breakdown in the bathroom asking people for help (No one helped me, I looked like a nut job). I could not even drive and was sobbing in the park lot for a queasy ten minutes. A film has NEVER done that to me. I have NEVER been shaken up like that. From an outside perspective, I kept asking myself why was I so upset? I'm into horror movies and the goth and the macabre. The investment and the camera work I think was what pulled me in too deep and thus triggered my very first panic attack. I've never even really believed in panic attacks because I have never had one. Until now.

Literally everything that happens in this film happens in the bible, but Aronofsky tells it from an outsiders perspective, with us following God and his endless search for love and understanding from those who cannot love or understand. His study represents the Garden of Eden, his crystal represents the fruit that Adam and Eve (Michele Pfieffer and Ed Harris) destroy. Then he shuts everyone out of the Garden.

IDvy0ybpOUI,"It's a metaphor for how Hollywood creates sub par crap that everyone goes to see, that it crushes any indie movie",1,0
IDvy0ybpOUI,"You can see it as God, Mother Nature. But to me I also see it more simply as fame/Hollywood as Bardem and Lawrence is the embodiment of actors themselves. People in this comment section further prove the point of the film, where people adore the art of the artist but neglect the human behind the art. People take the artists creation and tear it apart to satisfy themselves. There's even a couple scenes representative of any given comment section where people are in battle. Then once they've taken all they can, a new actor comes along to replace them. I think it covers my view and your view in a weirdly effective way. I could not think of a better time for JLaw to have taken this role, oh the irony of reading these comments after seeing this film, I would hope it gives people some new perspective on fame and celebrities. It tackles a lot of themes and ideas that would be more clear on a second viewing. Interesting to see how mainstream audiences react to it, it's a doozy for sure.",1,0

Some might call it ambitious, while some might call it pretentious. After watching mother! in theaters, I'm more on the spectrum of people praising the movie. While I do find the message to be obvious, the way Darren Aronofsky directed it was insane. I was left in shock after it ended. I'm surprised that it took Aronofsky 5 days to write the script. Like I said, a lot of people won't like this movie, and I respect your opinion. But to me, I found mother! to be unique.",1,0

IDvy0ybpOUI,"Embarrassing storytime:  Just saw Mother! this evening. In the final minutes of the film, I found myself so nauseous that I had to get  up and leave to go to the bathroom. When I got to the bathroom, I couldn't even unbutton my pants, the room was literally spinning. I peed all over the bathroom floor. The nausea in the film carried over to me. I had a breakdown in the bathroom asking people for help (No one helped me, I looked like a nut job). I could not even drive and was sobbing in the park lot for a queasy ten minutes. A film has NEVER done that to me. I have NEVER been shaken up like that. From an outside perspective, I kept asking myself why was I so upset? I'm into horror movies and the goth and the macabre. The investment and the camera work I think was what pulled me in too deep and thus triggered my very first panic attack. I've never even really believed in panic attacks because I have never had one. Until now. Despite some overkill and high and mighty horses the direction was off the charts and the acting swallowed me up.\\nI am not a sensitive person to religion or gore per say but I am still jarred by the way I responded to this movie.

Literally everything that happens in this film happens in the bible, but Aronofsky tells it from an outsiders perspective, with us following God and his endless search for love and understanding from those who cannot love or understand. His study represents the Garden of Eden, his crystal represents the fruit that Adam and Eve (Michele Pfieffer and Ed Harris) destroy. Then he shuts everyone out of the Garden. Plus he gets into a very interesting criticism of God himself, almost making him seem as an arrogant, ignorant fool ... I hope you read this and it made some degree of sense.

After leaving the movie, I was thinking very deeply about what Aronofsky was trying to get across with this movie, and I couldn't decide whether it was about religion or about mother earth.

Him is God,  mother is Mother Nature and later Mary, the house is the world, the first guest is Adam, the second guest is Eve, the sons are Cain and Abel, the baby is Jesus, the cannibalization of the baby is the communion.  Various other characters are allegories for other bible stories.

IDvy0ybpOUI,"You can see it as God, Mother Nature. But to me I also see it more simply as fame/Hollywood as Bardem and Lawrence is the embodiment of actors themselves. People in this comment section further prove the point of the film, where people adore the art of the artist but neglect the human behind the art. People take the artists creation and tear it apart to satisfy themselves. There's even a couple scenes representative of any given comment section where people are in battle. Then once they've taken all they can, a new actor comes along to replace them. I think it covers my view and your view in a weirdly effective way. I could not think of a better time for JLaw to have taken this role, oh the irony of reading these comments after seeing this film, I would hope it gives people some new perspective on fame and celebrities. It tackles a lot of themes and ideas that would be more clear on a second viewing. Interesting to see how mainstream audiences react to it, it's a doozy for sure.",1,0

While I do find the message to be obvious, the way Darren Aronofsky directed it was insane. I was left in shock after it ended. I'm surprised that it took Aronofsky 5 days to write the script.

Or people would talk about the deformed eyes (which isn't how all blind people's eyes look, by the way). But, you aren't being hypocrites at all.\\nAnd why did you need this video to validate that inner beauty is important? If you don't actually believe it, or you find yourself thinking of the physical, why should blind people? We're all apart of the same society, affected by the same ideals.\\nScent, the way someone's arm feels, the sound of their voice are all things we notice.

I ask my friends for basic descriptions so that I have an idea of what the person looks like, and then their opinion. Sighted people get their friends' opinions as well and it isn't seen as shallow. It's what you do once you've learned all you can, if you decide how you feel about someone on appearance alone, that determines the kind of person you are.\\nPS, someone said (I hope jokingly) that they expected them to say that beauty was black. If your fully blind, there is no blackness, or obstruction, it's just nothing. Think about the view behind your head, with only sound, touch, and scent to tell you what's happening. That's what a fully blind person sees. Though vision is on a scale, so blind may not mean fully/completely blind.",0,0

JO7X9ZPoAp8,"How do they define beauty when they are blind and don't know what beauty is. Then people in the comments are like someone can teach them. First of all, if someone teaches you what beauty is, then beauty it is what they think and not necessarily what beauty is really for you.  Beauty is also subjective,  video should be called things blind people think are beautiful/fulfilling because they don't know and can't understand what beauty truly is. Video is absolutely stupid.",1,0
JO7X9ZPoAp8,"I was in this video, thank you to many of you for the kind words. In any project, the editors take and use what they want to make the video flow the way they want without input from the folks cast in the roles. I am a blind person, I‚Äôm not perfect, and I have preferences related to what I find attractive in a partner, I also totally look at personality and if that person can make me laugh and that we have fun together.\\nI was asked to do this, because I thought it would be fun, but reading the majority of the comments, I am sure, I will never do it again‚Ä¶",1,0

JO7X9ZPoAp8,"I feel like what the creators of this video wanted was to portray real beauty as more than the physical/visual attributes of a person and give credence to the age old idea that beauty is on the inside.

Once Cassini arrived at Saturn she surprised us by discovering lakes on Titan, water plumes on Enceladus, and cheese on Iapetus. Furthermore, Cassini continued to function so well that the mission was extended by 9 years - more than tripling the planned length of the mission!

Sadly to say,  it's very common in our community that SOME of us are jealous and envious of one another.

So I have good skin because I'm always sweating but the upshot is that I've spent most of my life either saying Nooooo, it's not raining. I'm just...warm or feeling acute shame.

I didn't know that sweat didn't smell when you were younger until we learnt about puberty. I sweat a lot in general but I am mainly sweaty on my hands and feet and I HATE it. When I was younger I never wanted to play those games where you held hands or something with other kids because I was already sweating and then another person's body heat? Hell no. I always have serious anxiety from this. It was really bad in grade 5 and 6 because in class I would have to get up, grab a tissue, pretend to blow my nose but instead wipe my hands because my books would be drenched and I was so embarrassed. I now don't give high fives and everyone thinks I don't like hands because that's easier to say than sorry, my hands are dripping right now.

56kiI-JKSdY,"Thanks for taking the time to share this! My underarms, hairline, and most especially the back of my head from the base of my skull to my nape are my worst areas. I've actually considered botox, I just haven't done it. Two things that help me are to keep my armpits shaved (the hair just encourages dripping) and keep my hair off my neck. The biggest thing that has helped me has been seeing a chiropractor who specializes in nutrition response testing. She helped me to better balance my hormones, which caused the sweating to chill. I still get very sweaty if I'm at all overheated  (I live in CO at 7k altitude and STILL get overheated in weather above 60 degrees!) and my long sleeved shirts stay pushed up my forearms  (SOOOO glad I don't have uniform regs forbidding it now!!).

56kiI-JKSdY,For the longest time I thought there wasn't a name for it either. I just called it stress sweat. Worse part is I can take a shower.

Before using  botox, i would work at the office and always have wet spot for no reasons (heat, running etc).  I tried everything and this is the most effective. The doctor who came with that hes in Canada but many other clinic have the procedure. Also in between you can use driclor at night. Ok im posting rhis before watching the vid ill watch now lol",0,0

This form of the condition is impossible to hide you would think a hat or wool cap would work but all you get is a wet soggy cap sliding down your head. Sadly Botox is the only thing that can hep with this problem and it costs about $1000 per treatment because you need like 2 full vials of Botox but it lasts like 9 months and I think it's worth every penny.

iX6ScurPhCo,Wendy - you dont invite guest over and be so rude to them. Grow old gracefully Mrs Hunter!,0,0
iX6ScurPhCo,I really respect Rachel on how she continued to respond with grace and poise throughout this incredibly difficult interview. WOW! And not even once did she get defensive back.

iX6ScurPhCo,The reason why im watching this show now is coz Rachael's instagram which I follow led me here.so Wendy you better thank Rachael for giving you some airtime.

A show where a woman has to choose between so many men and winds up kissing and sleeping with some, most or all?! Yea, no thanks. Meanwhile, there could be people on the show who are just using you for fame.\\n\\n4) Rachael is playing off her feelings for Peter. She liked maybe even loved him alot.

This was an awful, shady interview that even the producers needed to stop, but what makes this truly worse is that Rachel took her precious time off of making that money for this horrible experience. Thankfully, Rachel stood her ground as a strong black woman that did her own thing, but I think that fuled (angered) Wendy even more.  This just angers me so much, like I just really can not, like even if you don't agree with her still do the interview with some respect for the audience. I really hopes she sees these comments, not just mine, because she really needs to check herself before she recks herself; she's probably not cause she doesn't care about her audience all that much (have you seen her on AskWendy lately). #I'veBeenHoldingThisInForTOOOLOOONG",0,0

Just over a year ago I began watching your YouTube series BrainScoop and was fascinated by the work you do!  I started thinking maybe I could be like Emily one day, being an ambassador of science inspiring young people to become stewards of the planet.  I looked into enrolling into university, but my high school grades and courses were not adequate.  So it was back to high school for me to upgrade my math and sciences at the ripe old age of 29!! Today I am 30 years old; two weeks into my first year of university at MacEwan in Edmonton Alberta.  I have four years ahead before I can officially call myself a scientist, but you set the wheels in motion!!  Never did I imagine myself ever attending college or university espt at my age!  I'm so excited to earn my science degree in biology and anthropology with the hope of working at a museum just like you!  Thank you Emily for making your videos and inspiring me!

56kiI-JKSdY,"Guys if you have this problem I cannot recommend Drysol enough. In Canada it is over the counter and it literally 100% stopped my sweating.  Like Jackie I too was that girl wearing her winter jacket or giant sweaters every day because the sweat stains under my arms were so, so excessive.  Like, SO BAD.  I could not wear tight T-shirts or shirts, ever.  However Drysol literally stops the sweat, it doesn't matter how hot or nervous I get, my armpits are bone dry.  I only need to use it once every 1-2 years now.  It's a miracle.",0,0

56kiI-JKSdY,"Sweaty Cuban girl here, and I am SO grateful you made this video. I relate to all of it, although I also have the sweaty hands and feet :( In high school I would wear all dark clothing (and use the sweater trick!) to hide the pit stains, I would NEVER wear sandals (even though I live in freaking Florida) and I was always terrified to shake or hold anyone's hands. I haven't gotten botox because it won't help my hands which are the worst, but to anyone reading the comments who struggles like I do I have tried some prescription options.\\nI hated Drysol because they told me you had to have bone-dry hands, feet, or armpits before you put it on (how dumb is that!?) and it itched so bad I couldn't sleep at night.\\nI do have a prescription for Glycopyrrolate (or Robinul) which is a pill that helped me significantly. I wouldn't have survived senior year without it. It can have some adverse side effects like dry mouth, but it is safe to play with the dose (within reason, listen to YOUR doctor) and once you figure out the perfect balance for yourself it is a lifesaver. \\nAlso, same for me that anxiety triggers it. Unfortunately, I was usually worried that I might sweat, so of course I would start to sweat and then I would freak out and it would get even worse! So young girls, don't freak out, realize there ARE options, and know that it really does get better after those teen years. :)\\nThanks again Jackie, officially subscribed.",0,0

56kiI-JKSdY,"Oh my goodness, Jackie, thank you for this video. I had no idea what this condition was called up until now. The yellow sweat marks on the shirts, I feel you girl!!! My mother used to bleach my shirts and they were still yellow. \\n\\nI always wear fabrics that don't show my sweat strains because they're absorbent or just don't show it, and I wear a lot of black too, because that doesn't show it either! I'm applying deodorant every hour at work (I work in retail) trying not to musk the customers away! \\n\\nI have considered Botox but it's not within my budget at the moment.\\n\\nThe most embarrassing thing is my face sweating. Any anxiety or if I even blink a little too hard, my face throws out buckets of sweat. I can't wear foundation, no matter how tough it is, my face sheds it within minutes. It just ends up looking like a cakey mess.\\n\\nAgain, thank you Jackie for this video. üòÑ",0,0

My hyperhidrosis was so bad i got bullied a lot for it back when I was younger, as well. I'm so sorry you had to go through the same thing. It's so hard to talk about, isnt it? I'm 20 now I still have so many issues with it especially with my clothes smelling and staining all over the place to the point i can almost barely wear anything tight fitting unless it's COTTON! what makes it worse is that I have contact dermatitis AND I live in a tropical country. my hyperhidrosis has impacted what i wear and how i do things so you are totally right about it practically being a lifestyle change. as embarrassing and almost funny as it is sometimes it really isn't easy. since it aggravates my allergies i sometimes have to spend extra time and effort and MONEY for my medicines. almost no deodorants worked for me, lest they trigger my allergies. plus, there are those cute shirts that I can't wear anymore cuz of pit stains </3 but knowing some things can be done to regulate it certainly is comforting... i'm so happy you became open about it, you're a person I really look up to.

56kiI-JKSdY,"The other thing is that there's a difference between perspiration and sweat. \\nPerspiration usually happens with anxiety, nerves, hormones etc. Sweat happens after a workout or when it's super hot/humid outside. Perspiration almost always has odor.  Sweat doesn't always have odor. But the reason it has odor is because of the bacteria that subsequently occurs on the skin after you've been sweating or perspiring. \\nSweating by itself doesn't generally have odor on its own. Now, I could be wrong here, but I'm pretty sure this is accurate information.",0,0

Don't fill them in anymore I just fell in love with them they are like legit perfection. And also I have an amazing DIY that I know you might like since your always this over the top fashionista and have your PhD in shoes. The DIY is to recreate in your own version the shoes that Rhianna gave JLo as a gift for her music video Ain't Your Mama. I freaking fell in love with those shoes they are denim over the knee high heel boots with a belt around the waist and they are attached to the belt. If you end up doing this DIY I will freaking love you for life because I've been wanting them but they are a wapping 3 or 4 grand. Thank you so much and I love you so much. #MOM,0,0

3d9i_0Ty7Cg,Who says you aren't the only one being simulated? What if everything you can't see isn't happening.,0,0
3d9i_0Ty7Cg,"So, if we exist inside a simulation, and we are unable to prove or disprove this based on our understanding of the natural world, would this be of any consequence to us? Assume that someone were to absolutely prove that our world existed inside a simulation. What would we do? Would knowing this really affect us? Initially, I want the fact to sadden me because everything I thought was real is just simulated... but what is real anyway? Rene Descartes' famous statement of I think, therefore, I am, promotes the idea that, even if the world around us is false, we, ourselves, are real because we have the ability to inaccurately perceive it. I believe this concept still holds true within this simulation theory. Even if we do just exist as a simulation, we still exist, and, to us, we are undoubtedly real. The simulation theory proposes subjective reality, but still reality. In the seventh Harry Potter book, when Harry asks Dumbledore if their conversation had been real or just inside his head, Dumbledore responds like this, Of course it is happening inside your head, Harry, but why on earth should that mean that it is not real? Even if we are inside a simulation right now, and our physics, families, and feelings are simulated, they are still real because of our ability to perceive. This is very settling to me.

They do not deserve the time of day, especially since he is not touching on the tax breaks that this ridiculous bill will give to the super rich.  Doesn't everyone know by now that this is the key goal?  Take away everything that President Obama did and put a republican name on it...political purposes, instead of fixing what we already know needs to be fixed in the ACA so that it helps more people.

56kiI-JKSdY,I‚Äôve totally had this problem for idk how long. I still have it. You mentioned thinking about sweating. I will psych myself out when I wear light colored clothes because I just know I‚Äôm gonna sweat heavily in them which is why my closet mainly consists of black. If I do wear light colored shirts I fold a paper towel and put in under my armpits. (My friend used to sew the paper towels in her shirt) but the panty liner hack is awesome as well. Thanks for being so candid about topics like this because as a woman it‚Äôs not easy to admit you deal with things like this. The world is so unapologetically judgmental that even the most natural things get criticized.,0,0

C'mon, I sweat. In highschool I went to the dermatologist and got some deodorant that I could only use at night 1,2 days after shaving and it literally would burn up my sweat glands, so I wouldn't perspire under my arms. After a few uses, I started sweating from my hands and feet because let's face it, I'm a heavy sweater. Now that I'm older, I also wear a lot of cotton, open breathable armed shirts, and eat a more balanced diet. I won't lie though, sometimes I shower with half a lemon with honey topped with (I alternate between Epsom salt and sugar) it seems to have helped as well as using all natural deodorants that ARE NOT anti perspirant.

But...  it was a wreck I couldn't look away from!  It wasn't just your beautiful voice, it was how you presented it.  How bad can this book get?  Ok... gotta click away... after a few more seconds...  Oh!  There's no way it can get worse than that!  Now I'm clicking off... after a few more seconds...  ;-)  Then the credits were rolling.\\n\\nBut as an independent author, I agree that we need to be supported.  And there is another possibility for this writer.  If you've ever done some reading about Heinlein and Asimov, you would know that they, and many other important writers, also did some erotica.  To pay the bills.  And to hone their skills I think.  I hate to suggest this, but take a peak at the book again.  Other than plot and substance, how well written is it?  Grammatically?  \\n\\nBTW, said I was an indi author.  If you've read this far, I'm going to plug my sci-fi series.  ;-)  https://www.amazon.com/Firing-Crucible-contact-Awakening-Phoenix/dp/1519029934/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1506181413&sr=8-3&keywords=michael+eves+shaffer  It's not selling quite as well even though It's got much better reviews.

yZMt87ZdUbw,"how about overly no-sexual talk; (best if read in low sinister some what gravelly voice) I am waiting to have coffee together, accept I don't drink coffee the caffeine raise my anxiety higher and higher and until I feel like I am about to go into a full blown panic attack, and for that reason I am getting the sleepy time tea with honey. Blind dates are nerve racking enough without chemically induced hyperactivity to worry about. then I see you open the door to this over priced coffee chain, that shall go unnamed for trade make reasons , it seems that you didn't put much effort in dressing for this date. hair pulled back held up with a dingy grey scrunchy and an outfit I am not sure if it came from a gym bag or if they are your PJ's. you head strait to the counter to order without even glancing my way. thank god I have time to fix the over dressing I have done. I quickly remove my tie and shove in my pocket and undo the top to button of my shirt. I consider a third, but stop myself what are you trying to show off your moobs? what if those are her gym cloths? she works out, when was the last time you worked out? and runs to the store for sad frozen pizzas for one and beer for 6 don't count! I think to myself because that is how thoughts work...she comes over and with a smile introduces herself confirming that she is a friend of a friend. I can feel my heart start to race and sweat start to form on the palms of my hands . YES!! *cough* yes i am friends with... i stop to grab my inhaler. An awkward gasp later I try to apologize  for my awkward awkwardness nearly as awkward as using awkward so many time in an awkward sentence. you just chuckle a little and say,  it's ok, it's not every day I take someones breath away. I pause , i feel my nervous smile start to soften in to a genuine gin. Soooo you say as my inner monologue continues, I hear we have a lot in common, you  are a huge nerd for Star Wars too?! (someone forgot to give you to memo on trade makes). still nervous I blurt out  NAH i AM ALL ABOUT BATTLE FIELD EARTH...  Our eyes meet and in a gaze we can tell we are both sarcastic assholes. we both start to laugh at the idea that anyone could like that train wreck....we talk for hours I let the tea grow cold, as conversation just won't stop flowing from our mouths like a back out toilet at denny's  on free meal night. (TRADE MARKS BE DAMNED) then it hits us that rush that is a mix of excitement are fear, WE'VE BEEN TALKING HOW LONG!? you have to get to work and I am also a productive member of society....promise...you jump up and rush out the door after give me a shoulder hug as i sit clumsily trying to reciprocate with a one armed hug around the middle of you back. you are gone now and I get a text for the friend of a friend:  how'd it go?\\nme: didn't throw up\\nFOAF: so 75% better than most of your dates\\nme:  that would be funnier if it wasn't mathematically accurate\\nFOAF: comedy is subjective, and the facts and hilarious to me! XD\\nme:  RDRR , I can make math jokes too\\nFoaF:  that is a pop-culture reference not a math joke but we are getting off topic what did you think of her?\\nMe:  she's a fun person to talk to I hope she enjoyed herself to I dont know if I am going to get put in the friends zone but I dont really care, not having hot a intelligent woman that shares my interests for a girlfriend wouldn't be awesome, it's just so would have a friend with all the same qualities\\nFOAF:  so you're saying you think she hot;)\\nme: well yeah\\nFoaf:  I am going to tell her\\nme: WFT, man DON'T!

I started thinking maybe I could be like Emily one day, being an ambassador of science inspiring young people to become stewards of the planet.

Today I am 30 years old; two weeks into my first year of university at MacEwan in Edmonton Alberta.  I have four years ahead before I can officially call myself a scientist, but you set the wheels in motion!!  Never did I imagine myself ever attending college or university espt at my age!

You project a\\nreally asexual vibe, but also really intimate and soft, sitting on the bed\\nsurrounded by plushies, talking about star wars and such, such a fangless world\\nof illusion and massive, emptying malls you seem to inhabit, Disneyland...\\nAnyway, we were in a room similar to my room, with a window overlooking a\\ngarden, a big window at night, and the thrill was really in playing this game\\nwhere I was seducing you, but you were clearly on-board from the\\nstart. There was no dumb coy aspect present, I was being very\\ndirect about it, but there was humor in the air. I have to tell you my\\ngirlfriend is SOFT, on a tactile level, my mind just ran those sensations when\\nI slid into your mouth (it¬¥s the internet, I know it¬¥s not impressive to write\\nthings like this, shut up, I¬¥m not trying to impress you). I mean, I know I\\ndon¬¥t really know you, and I don¬¥t want to cheat on my girlfriend lol, I¬¥m not\\ntrying to harass you or impress you, it was just a really vivid dream and I\\nmean, \\n\\nIt was a\\nreally mutual, sort of childish, innocent sequence of acts. Then the dream\\nbecame a Fanny and Alexander Christmas thing and you weren¬¥t in it\\nanymore, just a bunch of spoiled rich kids asking for blueberries in a huge,\\nthick comforting wooden kitchen table.

BDw7rRaZ6GM,"A couple of months and my mom passed,  june to august 27th its officially been a year and god it hurts because i wish she could have been like that, but it was also cancer and in the end she couldnt talk, had to have socks on her hands so she wouldn't take her oxygen mask off, it still feels so real, the nights i spent watching her from 11pm to 8am no sleep i stayed by her side listening to her rattling as she slept and i don't know why but this year is a lot harder for me and i cant focus on anything, ive been told multiple times to stop grieving because i should be past it but. That was my mom. She wanted me to get a degree but i can't do anything in my classes but cry and because of it my sister who i'm living with may kick me out. It's all so surreal I keep telling everyone I know like it's not real, that she won't kick me out but. Life is so. Horrible sometimes. I just hope that in the future I can be stable and have my own place with my partner, that's all I ask for.

YmnxIsRn5nw,This is one of my favorite beauty product reviews ever SIMPLY BECAUSE of the research and directions that you followed. Too often now I see a lot of beauty gurus just slap something on their face and get mad when it doesn't work or something bu you researched not only the products that it worked with and explained why you wouldn't be using them but you followed through by finding the closest product you could chemically.  So thank you!,2,0
YmnxIsRn5nw,I don't think it would work to mix it into the entire bottle! I think that the Velvetizer would settle and sink to the bottom of the foundation and you'd have to shake and mix it up REALLY well before you use it. I think maybe that's why it's better to mix it in for every use.,1,0
YmnxIsRn5nw,"LOVE your channel. You're hilarious. I can't get over these lashes (top AND bottom!)! What lashes are these? (And if it's just mascara on the bottom, GIRL, what is this magic?). Also, I am always in awe of how white your teeth are. Keep up the great work! <3",1,0

IFKkcaj0kAE,"I gave the new version a chance and found it very very boring. almost all scenes with pennywise and the kid's fear visions were presented like riding a cheap ghost train and a plastic skeleton appears next to you: oh, so terryfing. this element is also shown in other details like that old house they enter, it is so fucking unoriginal and totally horror-clich√©. \\nif it was just a movie about friendship it actually has some potential. but the whole pennywise thing sucked. he has no personality, except for one or two moments when you can actually see more of his character than just jump scare crab but those moments hardly occur.",0,0

I\\ndon¬¥t want to cheat on my girlfriend with you, and you sort of looked like a\\nmix of a bunch of different gals I¬¥ve found myself attracted to in my life, but\\nthe core was you, or your online persona anyway. You project a\\nreally asexual vibe, but also really intimate and soft, sitting on the bed\\nsurrounded by plushies, talking about star wars and such, such a fangless world\\nof illusion and massive, emptying malls you seem to inhabit, Disneyland...\\nAnyway, we were in a room similar to my room, with a window overlooking a\\ngarden, a big window at night, and the thrill was really in playing this game\\nwhere I was seducing you, but you were clearly on-board from the\\nstart. There was no dumb coy aspect present, I was being very\\ndirect about it, but there was humor in the air. I have to tell you my\\ngirlfriend is SOFT, on a tactile level, my mind just ran those sensations when\\nI slid into your mouth (it¬¥s the internet, I know it¬¥s not impressive to write\\nthings like this, shut up, I¬¥m not trying to impress you). I mean, I know I\\ndon¬¥t really know you, and I don¬¥t want to cheat on my girlfriend lol, I¬¥m not\\ntrying to harass you or impress you, it was just a really vivid dream and I\\nmean, \\n\\nIt was a\\nreally mutual, sort of childish, innocent sequence of acts. Then the dream\\nbecame a Fanny and Alexander Christmas thing and you weren¬¥t in it\\nanymore, just a bunch of spoiled rich kids asking for blueberries in a huge,\\nthick comforting wooden kitchen table. I just thought this would be fun to\\nwrite, and, hopefully, fun to read.",0,0

That was my mom. She wanted me to get a degree but i can't do anything in my classes but cry and because of it my sister who i'm living with may kick me out. It's all so surreal I keep telling everyone I know like it's not real, that she won't kick me out but. Life is so. Horrible sometimes. I just hope that in the future I can be stable and have my own place with my partner, that's all I ask for.

IDK if its the color or blending or how much you use....IDK. Maybe that is where i need to learn more about makeup and how to use it today. I was REALLY into makeup and looks in the 80s n 90s. I am 46 now, ijs. I look at my concealer and full face when done and my concealer doesnt pop out at me. Is that how it supposed to look? Am i applying incorrectly or wrong shade or not enough? You cant use my pic to judge, that pic was taken on a HOT FREAKIN MESS DAY and i just hv not changed it. NOT JIDGIMG HERE OR TROLLING HUN, DO NOT THINK THAT.

Idk I think it would be interesting. And make it more scary.",1,0
IFKkcaj0kAE,"I think one of the reasons this movie wasn't scary enough was because the kids are never REALLY scared. In the projector scene where they first saw Pennywise together, as soon as they open the garage door they are all like Phew! that was kinda scary and they're all having a conversation like they just saw a scary movie. Any kid (specially any kid in the 80's) would have been shaking and traumatized but they get over it so easily so why would anyone as an audience be more scared than the characters?",1,0

I saw the film the first night of the release and there was a group of teenage girls sitting close to me who were laughing. Fucking laughing. Not being scared. Not going, oh know!

BqL9T0_ClUg,"Pornography can lower the sense of self-esteem and self-worth of the wife because she may compare herself to the women that her husband is viewing on the screen.  She sees it as a slippery slope to addiction. It may also lead to an increase in the progression of rougher or more deviant sex. This contributes to the husband becoming more focused on his needs and not those of his wife.\\n\\nAll of the experts agree that a detachment of emotion during sex, and detachment from the relationship as a whole, is very dangerous to the viability of the marriage.

Today Mr. Hefner will wish he had turned from his sinful lifestyle instead of his hedonism and anti-Christian ideas.\\n\\nThe falling away from the faith and Christian based morality was only exacerbated under the Playboy philosophy that Hugh Hefner promulgated and published in his magazine.\\n\\nYou can watch the video below and remember that As it is once appointed unto man to DIE but after this THE JUDGMENT.

That was my mom. She wanted me to get a degree but i can't do anything in my classes but cry and because of it my sister who i'm living with may kick me out. It's all so surreal I keep telling everyone I know like it's not real, that she won't kick me out but. Life is so. Horrible sometimes. I just hope that in the future I can be stable and have my own place with my partner, that's all I ask for.

BqL9T0_ClUg,Jesus he sexualize women and other women believe they had to be perfect. Because of Playboy many women got plastic surgery porn got more and more popular it was just ridiculous. He's a pervert,2,1
BqL9T0_ClUg,"Pornography can lower the sense of self-esteem and self-worth of the wife because she may compare herself to the women that her husband is viewing on the screen.  She sees it as a slippery slope to addiction. It may also lead to an increase in the progression of rougher or more deviant sex. This contributes to the husband becoming more focused on his needs and not those of his wife.\\n\\nAll of the experts agree that a detachment of emotion during sex, and detachment from the relationship as a whole, is very dangerous to the viability of the marriage. Pornography is a poor substitute for the bonding version of sex.",1,1

BqL9T0_ClUg,Should you HATE Hugh Heffner? THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS DEATH.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESrCFrStey4,0,0
BqL9T0_ClUg,"Its all well and good talking mostly about the ILLUSION of 'women's choices' back then but the topic to me should have been W---H---Y HEFNER 'EMPOWERED' WOMEN (if you think that) or WHY HEFNER OBJECTIFIED WOMEN (if you think that). It appears the answer is the same - HEFNER 'USED' WOMEN FOR WEALTH and 'USED' WOMEN FOR HIS OWN SELF/SEXUAL GRATIFICATION! True no one forced any of those women but If a young woman you know CHOSE to sell her body in any way, would you 'empower' her by encourageing her to go ahead or would you 'empower' her with other options? EMPOWERMENT IS NOT EMPOWERMENT WITHOUT CHOICE. You are only 'empowered' according to your options and BAD CHOICES dont quate to being 'EMPOWERED'. Understand the definitions people. Are they telling me women had NO OTHER options back then? If there were no choices back then, how were they being empowered? More like sold the idea of it! (Talk about piss on my leg then tell me its raining). If Hefner empowered women, why was HE the one who had the most power overall? HE benefitted the MOST according to his assets! I wonder how many women he DISSUADED from prostitution regardless it was thier choice? How many non sexual women's issues did he give charity or support to? How many instances did he lend his support to that did not include sexual revelations to men or women? \\nA black or latino or asian man would never get kudos with the same legacy as they would be called a PIMP or in a woman's case in the same position- a MADAM! Yet another example of America's double standards and blind existence of WHITE MALE priviledge! It was called Playboy Mansion because the owner was white and a male who knocked champagne glasses with the likes of. It would have been called a brothel if it were owned by a female or brothel if the owner was non white period. I love Whoopy but on this occasion, a woman taking 'her destiny in her own hands' should benefit her. Sure they chose to be bunnies ect but they were NOT empowered. A suicide victim does not 'empower' themselves when they CHOOSE to kill themselves nor do they benefit for the sake of taking 'thier desitiny in thier own hands'. In the same vein, STOP excusing Hugh Hefner's prolonged sexual deviance as EMPOWERMENT towards women. His empire was called PLAY'BOY' - the empowerment of boys and men NOT WOMEN. STOP with the praising of this man",0,0

96LawfHPh6s,"It was so great to have you here at the Incredible Science Machine!! You brought so much energy to the team! Thanks for highlighting our event and doing this study - it was super fascinating to watch :)\\n\\nThis is exactly what I would have predicted: the bottom of the domino slips backwards more on surfaces with less friction and the domino line topples faster. I did my AP physics project on a similar concept and found that a smaller spacing on sandpaper (frictional surface) was SLOWER than a large spacing on sandpaper. What's interesting is that my original hypothesis was the exact opposite. From experience, usually a larger spacing is slightly slower on a normal wooden floor, but I didn't account for the floor surface when I made my hypothesis. A slippery floor surface (and also domino material, hence the color to speed variation) such as glass makes the dominoes fall faster.\\n\\nYou're right though that this is more complicated than we think, and having an unexplored area of domino physics is super exciting :) Can't wait to see what you discover in the next experiment!\\n\\nAlso a suggestion for starting the dominoes... I feel like we need some sort of motorized toppler that very, very slowly moves forward hitting the center of the first domino near the top. If you use a small spacing, the first domino may just lean against the next domino and not topple right away, but this would allow the bare minimum force required to topple the line. You're also right that a longer line is necessary so that the speed of the dominoes can reach terminal velocity. I'm not 100% sure how many dominoes that is (this could also vary with spacing), but I'd recommend maybe 50 in the line to be safe. Thanks again for coming! And now to watch the behind the scenes :D",1016,34

96LawfHPh6s,"While watching the analysis section, I was also thinking that the ~10 dominoes you were using weren't enough. Theoretically if you have a long enough chain ahead of the sample you are taking, the dominoes will settle into their own natural frequency and the effects of your triggering method will be filtered out. \\nAs you kind of alluded to, speed has to be defined as well. Do you care about the velocity of the individual dominoes or the speed of the wave through the dominoes? I'd probably take the point when one domino contacts the next to index and see how long till 10-15 tip. You know... If I had a high speed camera...",0,0
96LawfHPh6s,Idea for triggering dominos: Maybe you could use a retractable pen with the pin you need to push to release or maybe build something similar. Spring always goes down the same length and when you push the button it button will always shoot up at the same speed.,0,0
96LawfHPh6s,"I suspect one important factor for how fast dominos fall is their hardness.  Harder materials deform less under impact, which gives them an elastic collision characteristic.  Elastic collisions are more efficient in transferring energy than inelastic collisions.  Think about the difference between dropping a steel ball bearing on a hard floor versus dropping a lead shot.  Since the steel ball is harder, it will bounce much higher than the lead ball, where energy is wasted deforming it (slightly) and lost as heat.  Similarly, ordinary dominos are most likely made of ABS, while transparent ones are acrylic, which I do believe is significantly harder.  This makes the collisions more elastic, so the acrylic line falls faster.\\n\\nThe pigments used for colors can potentially make a notable difference in material properties, including hardness.  Even though only a small amount of pigment is used, thus probably not influencing density noticably, the presence of the pigment molecules disrupts and changes the structure of the polymer.  This can be viewed in much the same way as adding just a few percent of carbon to iron makes steel, a much tougher material.\\n\\nA quick thought:  You should verify whether the dominos are solid plastic or if they're hollow in the middle to save material costs.  A hollow domino is less rigid than a solid one, which drastically affects collision elasticity.",0,0
96LawfHPh6s,"You could use a motor that rotates at a constant speed, attach a stick to it that will knock over the first domino with the same force everytime.",0,0
96LawfHPh6s,"Nice video! To trigger you can set up a motor and do an easy code with arduino for example, so you can control position and time and have consistency (and also trigger the camera). You could also set up two guides for the pieces set up thing, so they are always in the same place. Annnndddd, it would be interesting to see when the pieces arrive to an steady state falling motion (stop accelerating).",0,0
96LawfHPh6s,"Destin! You could use a Pendulum as the trigger, if the collision isn't perfectly elastic it could accelerate the dominoes faster but if you aren't concerned with the transients it will reach steady state faster too. \\n\\nI'm guessing no slip will result in faster falling. When it slips it is rotating about the center of mass, or closer to it if kinetic friction is low enough. When it sticks it rotates about the stuck corner, if you think about the parallel axis theorem this will cause it to have a larger moment of inertia so the same amount of energy (the previous domino) will cause a stuck domino to reach the same degree of rotation slower than a slipping domino, knocking the next domino down slower. I think this is the prevailing behavior but of course this is only based off the analysis of one domino, ignoring things like friction over time.\\n\\nMy favorite thing about this channel is that when you see something interesting you immediately go design an experiment about it, that's pure science.",0,0
96LawfHPh6s,"So, you know how you shoot a pin ball with that spring-loaded rod? Maybe try building a mounted rod like that w/ a relatively weak spring.

The moment of rotational inertia for a rectangular prism spun about its centre is smaller than the moment of rotational inertia for the same rectangular prism spun about its end.\\nUse a pendulum for the trigger.\\nSee how low the domino is when it strikes the next, find the speed of the spin and you'll have its potential energy at point of impact. Subtract the speed of rotation right after to find transferred energy. From these we can probably find a way to extrapolate energy lost due to friction, and we may find that this is smaller than the extra energy to spin the domino about the bottom, which has the higher moment of inertia.",0,0

You could calculate the force imparted on the first domino, measure its slip on a given surface, and look at the distance from the CG to calculate the moment/rotation. It may be programmable to a certain extent too. If we can properly calculate the center of mass and impact force, the slip and coefficient of friction, the energy would be as good as conserved. Given the dKE + dPE + dU = Q - W. some of those variables would cancel out....",0,0
96LawfHPh6s,As far as control for the experiments.   The longer initial start should get some consistency going.   Best way is to run the same experiment multiple times and see what the variances are then go from there.,0,0

96LawfHPh6s,Maybe use some sort of actuator to trigger the start of the dominos,0,0
96LawfHPh6s,"Destin, I think you are changing too many variables at once in your test. You should try and select as many dominos as you can of roughly the same weight and put them on surfaces with different coefficients of friction.  A servo with a digital PWM controller/driver (RC controllers aren't quite exact enough) would allow you to contact the domino the same way every time.\\n\\nAs far as my hypothesis on the physics... On a perfectly smooth surface with rounded bottom edges the rotation would be purely around the CG and there would be no acceleration in the system. You would see both a rotational and translation momentum transfer (again assuming perfection) that would be equal to the force that you put into the system. However, as you increase friction the pivot point becomes further away from the CG which will allow more acceleration due to gravity therefore resulting in an eventually faster fall. Same thing goes for heavier dominoes; the contribution of gravity will be more significant. However there has to be a terminal velocity, so what is the constraining factor? Possibly loss of energy during the momentum transfer? You must also take into account the elasticity of the dominos as that will effect how quickly and efficiently the momentum is transferred. On a smooth surface however the moment of inertia is smaller and therefore the angular speed will be greater for the same amount of energy.\\n\\nA lot of different variables on this one and it will bug me (as I'm sure it will you) as I think about it over the next couple days.",0,0

96LawfHPh6s,"I think you should try hitting the domino with a stick that has a softer surface so it grips the domino better. I'm guessing the initial strength of the push varies depending on how hard you hit it so you would need to hit it with a certain psi for consistency. Try attaching the other end of the stick to some kind of pneumatic system that guarantees the same amount of energy. Then measure the result with a soft tip hitting the initial domino to start the reaction and a hard tip. See which works better, then try setting the domino's up on a block of ice. That would be an interesting variable.",0,0

You can include a spring and a block handle on the pushing end, so that the rods slide back after being pushed forward. This way, you get a momentary impulse. Also, you probably will want to mount your trigger device to the base that you're setting up the dominoes on, so the device cannot slide around.",0,0

96LawfHPh6s,The only way to keep consistency I think would probably be to mark on the side of the table Where you start the domino line. So it's in the same position on the table everytime just with a different surface. Also be sure to weigh down the surface so that no creases or air bubbles are in the way. I can't think of any easy way to have 100% consistaency in starting the chain reaction. Obviously a robot arm would work. Maybe if you had a piston of some sort. Actually I just thought of the most redneck way you could do it: mount a handgun to the table facing opposite the dominoes with no bullets pull the trigger and use the hammer of the gun to set off the dominos.,0,0

See, heavier objects will have a higher terminal velocity on a free fall, and although it is a short fall to be considered for a single domino, when the horizontal acceleration builds up AND the amount of dominoes falling increases, the starting of the next one will be ever so slightly early, right?\\n\\nSo, even if one-by-one domino comparison seems whimsy and irrelevant, the pile up on a bigger amount can be visible on speed, I guess.

BqL9T0_ClUg,"Its all well and good talking mostly about the ILLUSION of 'women's choices' back then but the topic to me should have been W---H---Y HEFNER 'EMPOWERED' WOMEN (if you think that) or WHY HEFNER OBJECTIFIED WOMEN (if you think that). It appears the answer is the same - HEFNER 'USED' WOMEN FOR WEALTH and 'USED' WOMEN FOR HIS OWN SELF/SEXUAL GRATIFICATION! True no one forced any of those women but If a young woman you know CHOSE to sell her body in any way, would you 'empower' her by encourageing her to go ahead or would you 'empower' her with other options? EMPOWERMENT IS NOT EMPOWERMENT WITHOUT CHOICE. You are only 'empowered' according to your options and BAD CHOICES dont quate to being 'EMPOWERED'. Understand the definitions people. Are they telling me women had NO OTHER options back then? If there were no choices back then, how were they being empowered? More like sold the idea of it! (Talk about piss on my leg then tell me its raining). If Hefner empowered women, why was HE the one who had the most power overall? HE benefitted the MOST according to his assets! I wonder how many women he DISSUADED from prostitution regardless it was thier choice? How many non sexual women's issues did he give charity or support to? How many instances did he lend his support to that did not include sexual revelations to men or women? \\nA black or latino or asian man would never get kudos with the same legacy as they would be called a PIMP or in a woman's case in the same position- a MADAM! Yet another example of America's double standards and blind existence of WHITE MALE priviledge! It was called Playboy Mansion because the owner was white and a male who knocked champagne glasses with the likes of. It would have been called a brothel if it were owned by a female or brothel if the owner was non white period. I love Whoopy but on this occasion, a woman taking 'her destiny in her own hands' should benefit her. Sure they chose to be bunnies ect but they were NOT empowered. A suicide victim does not 'empower' themselves when they CHOOSE to kill themselves nor do they benefit for the sake of taking 'thier desitiny in thier own hands'. In the same vein, STOP excusing Hugh Hefner's prolonged sexual deviance as EMPOWERMENT towards women. His empire was called PLAY'BOY' - the empowerment of boys and men NOT WOMEN.

96LawfHPh6s,"It was so great to have you here at the Incredible Science Machine!! You brought so much energy to the team! Thanks for highlighting our event and doing this study - it was super fascinating to watch :)\\n\\nThis is exactly what I would have predicted: the bottom of the domino slips backwards more on surfaces with less friction and the domino line topples faster. I did my AP physics project on a similar concept and found that a smaller spacing on sandpaper (frictional surface) was SLOWER than a large spacing on sandpaper. What's interesting is that my original hypothesis was the exact opposite. From experience, usually a larger spacing is slightly slower on a normal wooden floor, but I didn't account for the floor surface when I made my hypothesis. A slippery floor surface (and also domino material, hence the color to speed variation) such as glass makes the dominoes fall faster.\\n\\nYou're right though that this is more complicated than we think, and having an unexplored area of domino physics is super exciting :) Can't wait to see what you discover in the next experiment!\\n\\nAlso a suggestion for starting the dominoes... I feel like we need some sort of motorized toppler that very, very slowly moves forward hitting the center of the first domino near the top. If you use a small spacing, the first domino may just lean against the next domino and not topple right away, but this would allow the bare minimum force required to topple the line. You're also right that a longer line is necessary so that the speed of the dominoes can reach terminal velocity. I'm not 100% sure how many dominoes that is (this could also vary with spacing), but I'd recommend maybe 50 in the line to be safe. Thanks again for coming! And now to watch the behind the scenes :D",1250,47
96LawfHPh6s,"Something you don't seem to be considering about those plastic dominoes is handling.  The oil from your hands builds up over time the more they're handled/used.  Maybe they should all be washed before a new round of tests and clean gloves used to handle them?\\n\\nOr, the difference the hand sweat makes could be so minimal as to not matter?  But, if you set up pieces that have been used a multitude of times next to brand new first time used pieces, the newer ones would likely slip on the surface easier than the older ones.\\n\\nThe tipping start:  A swinging weight that hits the first domino the same way each time.  Locked in place with a release that doesn't propel or hamper the weight.\\n\\nHope this helps.  Maybe you'll come up with something else from reading this.\\n\\nAs always, have fun!

96LawfHPh6s,"I like the idea of a pendulum because it would provide a consistent force, but I have general concerns about striking the first domino. Variance in the elasticity of the different domino materials would give the different materials a different bounce off the impact of the pendulum. I believe it would be better to gradually push the center of gravity over the base until the domino topples on its own. All the variables would be isolated to the features of the domino itself (Mu, mass, etc.) and not how they interact with the initiating force. By mounting a wedge on a vertical slide, you could isolate horizontal movement from striking the domino.

96LawfHPh6s,"I've watched this video a few times, and I think I know why it's faster on a lower friction surface (and also why different colors fall faster) \\nOn higher friction surfaces, the dominos maintain contact with eachother after beginning to fall, creating friction between the dominoes themselves and slowing the fall each falling domino, reducing the terminal velocity of the domino chain by removing energy from the forward translation.\\nOn lower friction surfaces, the domino rotates easily around its center of mass, and the individual dominoes contact each other much less, rotating out of the way of each other until it can no longer be avoided, reducing the friction against each other and keeping more energy in the forward translation of the domino. \\nIf the dominoes themselves were also made of a lower friction material, this effect would be bolstered, albeit minimally.",0,0

96LawfHPh6s,I think that hitting a domino with anything like a ball on a pendulum or newton's cradle will impart a total sliding force to the first domino.  Evaluate the use of a coneshaped weight sliding on a vertical rod falling say 1 inch(?) adjusted to just barely touch and knock over the first domino.  The vector of the push will then be at a downward  angle to the domino hopefully negating the horizontal slide.  If you are interested email Roy R. Reynolds  bevertrain@gmail.com.\nAnother interesting investigation would be to film a straight rod resting on a horizontal surface that is supported vertically then let go.  It will start to fall then the base will kick away from the direction of fall along the horizontal surface.,0,0

My rationale is in thinking about moment and arm, or even a spinning ice skater.  With a spinning ice skater, they rotate faster as they pull in and rotate slower as they expand out.  I'm not sure how this relates to arm but it makes me think that the dominoes slipping on a slippery surface go faster.  The forward motion may not have as much force as it is a shorter arm, but it can move forward faster as it really only has to move half of the domino forward and the other half moving backward which may help to reduce the time it takes to contact the next domino.

96LawfHPh6s,I am late to comment on here but here are my thoughts.\n1. Triggering: A consistent trigger could be made from from a slow moving motorized pushing element. Something that is going to repeatedly push the domino so slowly that once the domino's center of gravity passes over the edge that it is tilting on the domino would accelerate away from the pushing element so kinetic energy from the pushing element is negligible. \n2. You should consider doing a study on the steady state conditions of the dominos and figure out the maximum number of dominos that need to fall over to reach steady state as a function of the friction and domino mass and then add 10-20% to that number and use that for all of your tests. Only film the section that is within the steady state region. This sounds like a time consuming process but dominoes are a time consuming past time in the first place...,0,0
96LawfHPh6s,"On the slippery surface, it is allowed to rotate around its center of mass, so there is little energy loss and the rotation of the block is faster and so it hits the next block faster. On the grippy surface, the block is forced to rotate more around the right bottom edge and therefore you have a longer rotating arm which rotates slower with the same energy. Also the center of mass has to rise a tiny amount to get over the edge. If it slips, the center of mass stays basicaly at the same height so again, less energy loss. And other effects I'm sure.\\nCould it be something like this?\\nAwesome dominoes a video!",0,0

BqL9T0_ClUg,dead. good. should have died along time ago. a disgrace to us men & manhood who respect women.  he was a piece of rubbish. good riddance.,3,0
BqL9T0_ClUg,Died with his dick in some underage girl. Nasty prick.,3,0
BqL9T0_ClUg,He died doing what he loved...looking at and fucking women,4,0
BqL9T0_ClUg,At least Hell has one less vacancy,3,0
BqL9T0_ClUg,I'm sorry but I cannot mourn the death of a man who spent most of his life objectifying women... he was a nasty nasty man...,9,2
BqL9T0_ClUg,Can't say his in a better place now....,0,0
BqL9T0_ClUg,Ya sex sells for whores not for decent women  who work hard and are pillar of this society so fuck him,0,0
BqL9T0_ClUg,Should you HATE Hugh Heffner? THE TRUTH ABOUT HIS DEATH.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESrCFrStey4,0,0
BqL9T0_ClUg,It is real. Look up what i told you to,0,0
BqL9T0_ClUg,"Its all well and good talking mostly about the ILLUSION of 'women's choices' back then but the topic to me should have been W---H---Y HEFNER 'EMPOWERED' WOMEN (if you think that) or WHY HEFNER OBJECTIFIED WOMEN (if you think that). It appears the answer is the same - HEFNER 'USED' WOMEN FOR WEALTH and 'USED' WOMEN FOR HIS OWN SELF/SEXUAL GRATIFICATION! True no one forced any of those women but If a young woman you know CHOSE to sell her body in any way, would you 'empower' her by encourageing her to go ahead or would you 'empower' her with other options? EMPOWERMENT IS NOT EMPOWERMENT WITHOUT CHOICE. You are only 'empowered' according to your options and BAD CHOICES dont quate to being 'EMPOWERED'. Understand the definitions people. Are they telling me women had NO OTHER options back then? If there were no choices back then, how were they being empowered? More like sold the idea of it! (Talk about piss on my leg then tell me its raining). If Hefner empowered women, why was HE the one who had the most power overall? HE benefitted the MOST according to his assets! I wonder how many women he DISSUADED from prostitution regardless it was thier choice? How many non sexual women's issues did he give charity or support to? How many instances did he lend his support to that did not include sexual revelations to men or women? \\nA black or latino or asian man would never get kudos with the same legacy as they would be called a PIMP or in a woman's case in the same position- a MADAM! Yet another example of America's double standards and blind existence of WHITE MALE priviledge! It was called Playboy Mansion because the owner was white and a male who knocked champagne glasses with the likes of. It would have been called a brothel if it were owned by a female or brothel if the owner was non white period. I love Whoopy but on this occasion, a woman taking 'her destiny in her own hands' should benefit her. Sure they chose to be bunnies ect but they were NOT empowered. A suicide victim does not 'empower' themselves when they CHOOSE to kill themselves nor do they benefit for the sake of taking 'thier desitiny in thier own hands'. In the same vein, STOP excusing Hugh Hefner's prolonged sexual deviance as EMPOWERMENT towards women. His empire was called PLAY'BOY' - the empowerment of boys and men NOT WOMEN. STOP with the praising of this man",0,0

This contributes to the husband becoming more focused on his needs and not those of his wife.\\n\\nAll of the experts agree that a detachment of emotion during sex, and detachment from the relationship as a whole, is very dangerous to the viability of the marriage.

96LawfHPh6s,"It was so great to have you here at the Incredible Science Machine!! You brought so much energy to the team! Thanks for highlighting our event and doing this study - it was super fascinating to watch :)\\n\\nThis is exactly what I would have predicted: the bottom of the domino slips backwards more on surfaces with less friction and the domino line topples faster. I did my AP physics project on a similar concept and found that a smaller spacing on sandpaper (frictional surface) was SLOWER than a large spacing on sandpaper. What's interesting is that my original hypothesis was the exact opposite. From experience, usually a larger spacing is slightly slower on a normal wooden floor, but I didn't account for the floor surface when I made my hypothesis. A slippery floor surface (and also domino material, hence the color to speed variation) such as glass makes the dominoes fall faster.\\n\\nYou're right though that this is more complicated than we think, and having an unexplored area of domino physics is super exciting :) Can't wait to see what you discover in the next experiment!\\n\\nAlso a suggestion for starting the dominoes... I feel like we need some sort of motorized toppler that very, very slowly moves forward hitting the center of the first domino near the top. If you use a small spacing, the first domino may just lean against the next domino and not topple right away, but this would allow the bare minimum force required to topple the line. You're also right that a longer line is necessary so that the speed of the dominoes can reach terminal velocity. I'm not 100% sure how many dominoes that is (this could also vary with spacing), but I'd recommend maybe 50 in the line to be safe. Thanks again for coming!

(Basically the centre of mass of the domino has to rise until it is exactly over the base corner of the domino).\\n\\nIf the domino slips, wouldn't that mean that the time spent (and maybe the energy too?) getting to this maximum height of the centre of mass is shorter, allowing for a reduced loss in energy as the domino tips over.\\n\\nWonder if this is true...",0,0

96LawfHPh6s,Use an electromagnetic solenoid to initiate topling for consistency or a simple pendulum with a fixed tilt angle so that all the initial knocks are the same . Yes I noticed the accelerating thing so maybe you need to have enough dominoes for terminal velocity to be reached before you can examine the speed at which they fall.

Better still if you can build a trigger that releases it so you take your hand out of the equation.\\n\\nLet go the ball and it'll move forward and hit the first domino, but calibrate it such that it stops juuust after touching the first domino so it can't whack the next 2-3 dominoes, or send the first domino flying. Calibrate it to hit the first domino with just enough force to topple it but not cause it to flick and spin. you can do that in two ways, calibrating the stopping point, or the angle that you're pulling it back to.\\n\\nAlso, maybe glue down one domino flat on the surface in the front so you know exactly where to lay the first domino.",0,0

96LawfHPh6s,"I guess you need to remove human pushing system and let a spring and a trigger make the pushing job to always make sure you get the same pressure point at the begening so you would have the same initial speed force. I guess you would need to calculate all friction force that occur in your system to understand all of that. \\n\\nBut thank you Dustin it was a great video like usually, keep doing your good work!",0,0
96LawfHPh6s,"Hey Destin - a couple thoughts on your domino experiments:\\n1. I wouldn't worry about your initial tipping mechanism. As long as you have enough dominoes to get to steady-state, the initial push shouldn't change much.\\n2. If you don't worry about the initial push, the only thing you can't do is a race between two types of dominoes like you did in this video. But it was a little difficult to see. You can probably make up the difference in post by aligning two different runs top and bottom to get the same effect.\\n3. More slippery domino or surface means less friction, which should make the domino fall faster because the friction with the ground works against the direction of rotation, making them rotate and fall more slowly.\\n4. That being said, the dominoes with more friction should fall further forward for the same reason, allowing the grippy dominoes to be spaced even further apart, (slowing them down even more?). You saw the opposite in your tests so far, but that may have to do with how close the dominoes are spaced - if they are too close for this effect to matter, the more slippery dominoes may end up falling further because when the last one or two get squished out at the end of the drop, they can slide further before stopping. This may mean the speed difference between high and low friction also depends a lot on spacing.\\n5. I feel like heavier/lighter dominoes shouldn't play a huge roll. Think of the effect of dropping a heavy and light ball of the same size (Veritasium has some great videos on this). They end up falling at the same rate. But we're not dealing with spheres here, so it's possible rotational inertia has some different effects, and my instinct is way off.\\n\\nGreat work!",2,0
96LawfHPh6s,"I think if you're going to keep it on a Mythbusters type level, you need to have a rig where the initial force comes from a pivoting reference domino swinging down from above on an initial horizontal start and making flush contact with the initial domino at whatever your testing has shown the proportional dimension is for first contact.  Your line of test dominoes needs to be about 4 times as long.  Then you can use that same manner of domino (material, mass, spacing, etc.) as your baseline and compare the various other masses, colors, sizes, materials, etc to it.  You'll draw fewer hard number conclusions, but you'll verify rules of thumb, such as his comment that more friction increases speed.",0,0
96LawfHPh6s,"I agree with, Joe Brown!",0,0
96LawfHPh6s,On a short run of dominoes the trigger speed would be of importance. But I would think that on a long run of dominoes at some point you would achieve constant velocity. Because even if you used a constant trigger for the first Domino the density or hardness of that first Domino would even have an effect. Therefore I would look for a constant velocity of falling dominoes somewhere down the line on a long run. It's kind of like falling at some point you're going to achieve constant velocity whether you jump off a platform or are thrown from a platform.,0,0
96LawfHPh6s,"I was actually wondering this while watching the video that you cant hit the dominoes at the exact same point manually by a stick.

96LawfHPh6s,"Does it matter at what force the initial topple is if we're trying to find the terminal velocity of the chain? We just need a longer chain to reach terminal velocity. If I'm wrong and it does matter, I like the suggestions of a pendulum. Perhaps use an electromagnet to hold the pendulum in a set place and turn the magnet off to release the pendulum. Further, you might want to fix the device to space the dominoes in place so you can get a consistent starting place for the dominoes in relation to the pendulum. Perhaps the pendulum and the spacer could be one device that can be placed on the different surfaces. \\n\\nYou might want to look at how the different dominoes act in isolation as well. Knock over one domino and see how it falls and how fast it pivots as it falls. Would a domino pivoting around its center of mass pass the threshold of the next domino faster than a domino pivoting at the leading edge of its base?\\n\\nTo compare the speeds of two concurrent domino chains it might be helpful to film from above. Filming from the side obscures one of the chains. If you do film races, you might have to include a second spacer aligned with the first on your pendulum/spacer device.\\n\\nIt also might be interesting to see which types of dominoes accelerate the fastest to their terminal velocity.

The servo/actuator is more consistent and reliable.,0,0

96LawfHPh6s,"It‚Äôs simple. It can be explained by the conservation of momentum. The reason why ‚Äòslipping‚Äô ‚Äòincreases the speed‚Äô is because when it pivots on it‚Äôs centre of mass, there is a smaller moment of inertia, therefore it can rotate faster and displace the next domino quicker, even though the clear domino‚Äôs have a slightly higher mass.

So what you want to do is set up a longer row and start the measurement in the middle. That way you eliminate start and end of line effects. Like set up 50 dominoes and record the ones from 30-40. That way you measure whats happening in the middle, which is 99% of whats happening with 250k dominoes. And that's whats relevant to you.",0,0

96LawfHPh6s,Why was there a flat escalator??,0,0
96LawfHPh6s,I was thinking that you could trigger the dominos by making a small contraption with a domino-sized leg that could be put in the index along with the dominos and put a motor on this contraption that will turn at a consistent rate each time and knock the first domino down the same way each time.,0,0
96LawfHPh6s,Great videos Destin!  One suggestion.  What about using a pendulum to push the first domino over?  It could be calibrated to use just enough force to knock over the domino and is repeatable by bringing the pendulum to the same height each time.,0,0
96LawfHPh6s,"I think that slipping actually makes the dominoes faster. I think the little bit of time they spend in the air contributes to a higher amount of force being applied to the next domino as the domino not only topples onto the next piece but also partly falls as well. It also takes less force to push the next domino if it slips after being toppled compared to if it had to quite literally lift up and over the cross between bottom right to top left. If it slips, it immediately falls and the translation of the force is more direct. I think the smoother the surface of the domino, the less energy is wasted on them rubbing against each other meaning they can topple faster. Friction is really everything in this scenario. It's the only variable because the size seems to be the same and it still has to do with gravity being the main driving force, so mass only really applies when it is used to fight the friction. I think that no matter how heavy these dominoes are, the weight will only affect the acceleration but once they reach the default speed it will be the same no matter the weight.",0,0
96LawfHPh6s,You should use some sort of robot to automate the starting force and location of the dominoes.,0,0

96LawfHPh6s,"Not sure how many people have suggested this, but perhaps trigger the dominoes with a pendulum that releases from a consistent point?",0,0
96LawfHPh6s,"Here is my thoughts on how to drop a domino constantly. \\n\\nTake one domino and drill a hole through it along the long narrow side making it slightly top heavy. Attach the domino through a shaft that will suspend it ever so slightly above the table. The domino should still be able to swing forward as it normally would (pivoting on the shaft). Use a pin coming up from underneath the table. The pin should block or prevent the already forward leaning domino from completing its forward swing/drop.  Removing the pin‚Äîby pulling down‚Äîshould not introduce lateral force on the domino, but allow gravity to complete the forward swing/simulated drop",0,0
96LawfHPh6s,use a electric linear actuator to knock over the first domino. or a servo would work. put on a switch and take the human element out of it.,0,0

96LawfHPh6s,"Use servo/arduino  for consistent trigger. \\n\\nGenerally friction = slow.\\n\\nSlipper surface might result in less energy going forward, but it also mean it take less energy to rotate the dominons because of smaller moment of inertia. my guess is that the latter has a greater effect, because moment of inertial is proportional to *Square* of the distance between material and center of rotation. even factoring all the integrals for geometry, it's still bigger ratio then the one for momentum transfer.",0,0
96LawfHPh6s,"This is amazing, and here are my ideas:\\n\\nHypotheses & Theoretical Mechanics :\\nI tried to trough all the mechanics at it university physics taught me,  and not even trusty old Lagrange worked, because the center of rotation gives one too many degrees of freedom for me to solve the DEQ properly. It is a super exciting problem, and I will most definitely annoy my professors with it.\\nAnother very annoying thing is that the system isn't closed, otherwise you would expect the dominoes to accelerate forever, so a terminal speed wouldn't exists.\\n\\nTriggering:\\nI'd probably get a linear motor, but if you want it mechanically, the easiest consistent way that comes to my mind is dropping a ball or a wedge from a constant height close to the dominoes.\\n\\nScientific method:\\nI'd try to eliminate different parts of the equation, make a run with the same dominoes (ideally large, massive ones with a smooth surface) on hinges, without them and with the dominoes being suspended on strings (simulating infinite, low and high friction).",0,0

96LawfHPh6s,"It was so great to have you here at the Incredible Science Machine!! You brought so much energy to the team! Thanks for highlighting our event and doing this study - it was super fascinating to watch :)\\n\\nThis is exactly what I would have predicted: the bottom of the domino slips backwards more on surfaces with less friction and the domino line topples faster. I did my AP physics project on a similar concept and found that a smaller spacing on sandpaper (frictional surface) was SLOWER than a large spacing on sandpaper. What's interesting is that my original hypothesis was the exact opposite. From experience, usually a larger spacing is slightly slower on a normal wooden floor, but I didn't account for the floor surface when I made my hypothesis. A slippery floor surface (and also domino material, hence the color to speed variation) such as glass makes the dominoes fall faster.\\n\\nYou're right though that this is more complicated than we think, and having an unexplored area of domino physics is super exciting :) Can't wait to see what you discover in the next experiment!\\n\\nAlso a suggestion for starting the dominoes... I feel like we need some sort of motorized toppler that very, very slowly moves forward hitting the center of the first domino near the top. If you use a small spacing, the first domino may just lean against the next domino and not topple right away, but this would allow the bare minimum force required to topple the line. You're also right that a longer line is necessary so that the speed of the dominoes can reach terminal velocity. I'm not 100% sure how many dominoes that is (this could also vary with spacing), but I'd recommend maybe 50 in the line to be safe. Thanks again for coming! And now to watch the behind the scenes :D",1351,51
96LawfHPh6s,"Hi Destin, another great video - many thanks! Could I ask what sort of high speed camera you are using?",0,0
96LawfHPh6s,Use a step motor in order to trigger the dominoes. It is very precise and you can control the movement to a very manageable and calculate-able constant.,0,0
96LawfHPh6s,You could build a motorised pushing machine out of Lego or K'nex.,0,0
96LawfHPh6s,"I think how you actually tip the first domino is irrelevant. As you mentioned in the video, the speed at the beginning is different but it will get to it's own actual speed over time (within the first let's say 20 dominoes). So what you want to do is set up a longer row and start the measurement in the middle. That way you eliminate start and end of line effects. Like set up 50 dominoes and record the ones from 30-40. That way you measure whats happening in the middle, which is 99% of whats happening with 250k dominoes. And that's whats relevant to you.",0,0
96LawfHPh6s,I think if you use a small linear actuator you will be able to control the speed at which you push the first domino as well as how far you want to push it. I don't think they ate crazy expensive either for a small one. Hope i can help!,0,0
96LawfHPh6s,maybe the force exerted on the first domino every time should be a constant?,0,0

96LawfHPh6s,one idea for knocking the dominoes down consistently is to use a pendulum and a catch just pull back a string and let gravity do the work. All you need to do is set the catch to a certain height then release the catch oh also make sure the weight doesn't swing too far that'll just mess up the speed.,0,0
96LawfHPh6s,"Hi Destin big fan of SmarterEveryDay here. I have a hunch of using a graph of Coefficient of Friction vs. Time to prove if friction truly is helping to speed up the topple or slow it down. Also try triggering the fall in different areas of the dominoes e.g. In the CG, In the Upper surface, and etc.\\nThanks for the cool knowledge every video. :D Kudos!",0,0
96LawfHPh6s,Why was there a flat escalator??,0,0
96LawfHPh6s,I was thinking that you could trigger the dominos by making a small contraption with a domino-sized leg that could be put in the index along with the dominos and put a motor on this contraption that will turn at a consistent rate each time and knock the first domino down the same way each time.,0,0
96LawfHPh6s,Great videos Destin!  One suggestion.  What about using a pendulum to push the first domino over?  It could be calibrated to use just enough force to knock over the domino and is repeatable by bringing the pendulum to the same height each time.,0,0
96LawfHPh6s,"I think that slipping actually makes the dominoes faster. I think the little bit of time they spend in the air contributes to a higher amount of force being applied to the next domino as the domino not only topples onto the next piece but also partly falls as well. It also takes less force to push the next domino if it slips after being toppled compared to if it had to quite literally lift up and over the cross between bottom right to top left. If it slips, it immediately falls and the translation of the force is more direct. I think the smoother the surface of the domino, the less energy is wasted on them rubbing against each other meaning they can topple faster. Friction is really everything in this scenario. It's the only variable because the size seems to be the same and it still has to do with gravity being the main driving force, so mass only really applies when it is used to fight the friction. I think that no matter how heavy these dominoes are, the weight will only affect the acceleration but once they reach the default speed it will be the same no matter the weight.",0,0

Attach the domino through a shaft that will suspend it ever so slightly above the table. The domino should still be able to swing forward as it normally would (pivoting on the shaft). Use a pin coming up from underneath the table. The pin should block or prevent the already forward leaning domino from completing its forward swing/drop.  Removing the pin‚Äîby pulling down‚Äîshould not introduce lateral force on the domino, but allow gravity to complete the forward swing/simulated drop",0,0

Then you can use that same manner of domino (material, mass, spacing, etc.) as your baseline and compare the various other masses, colors, sizes, materials, etc to it.

96LawfHPh6s,On a short run of dominoes the trigger speed would be of importance. But I would think that on a long run of dominoes at some point you would achieve constant velocity. Because even if you used a constant trigger for the first Domino the density or hardness of that first Domino would even have an effect. Therefore I would look for a constant velocity of falling dominoes somewhere down the line on a long run. It's kind of like falling at some point you're going to achieve constant velocity whether you jump off a platform or are thrown from a platform.,0,0
96LawfHPh6s,"SmarterEveryDay Read this!\\n\\nWouldn't the domino chain reaction go faster on the slick surface since the friction on the pivot point is reduced, therefore allowing the domino to pivot more freely, thus ultimately faster? I'll explain my thought below...\\n\\nYou can clearly see that dominoes on the slick surface pivot more than the dominoes on the grippy surface.This could be a result of a reaction to the lack of friction on the pivoting surface (right corner of domino) which allows the domino to appear to spin about it's center of gravity faster than a domino subjected to friction on that pivot surface. Therefore when the domino is on a relatively grippy surface, the domino slips less, thusly translating the rotational potential about the pivoting axis that is relatively fixed compared to the sliding ( or variable) axis on the domino on a slick surface. \\n\\nTherefore, the main variance between the two domino sets is the change in friction on the pivoting plane. The slick surface domino has a sliding rotational axis, whereas the domino with the grippy surface has a fixed axis. As a result of this, the rotational axises between dominoes on a grippy surface versus one on a slick surface are in fact different.  A result of this difference in pivoting planes means that the center of gravity between both sets of dominos changes as well. The sliding domino has a higher center of gravity (more centralized), meaning it can pivot faster about it's pivoting point than the grippy surface domino. Since the distribution of mass across the pivot point can alter the speed of the rotation, an object with a centralized pivot point can rotate faster and smoother (think about it like a wheel, a center hub will spin more efficiently than offsetting the hub even just a few degrees). Further, due to the small size of dominoes, this difference is minute, (pivoting planes may only be a millimeter or less different) yet extrapolated out over hundreds or thousands of dominoes, this small variation compounds itself into a noticeable difference in speed. \\n\\nA second possible hypothesis is that the resulting frictional interface between the domino and the surface it is rotating about  causes a reduction in potential energy of the system. We know that friction takes energy away from a system by converting some of the kinetic energy into another form of energy (like heat, which is how disc brakes on a car work). Looking at the highspeed footage it appears as though the  resting dominoes hop once the interaction with a falling domino is initiated. Therefore, in order to move, the domino must overcome not only it's resting state of motion (Newton's first law) but also the energy required to move it from the surface it touches (friction with the surface it sits on). This hopping is exactly that motion, overcoming it's resting state of motion. While the domino is in the air, it is allowed to rotate and accelerate freely (assuming the interaction with air is negligent). Yet when the domino lands back down on the surface it must rotate relative to it's contact point. On a slippery surface, the domino is allowed to rotate more freely thus inducing a sliding axis as a result of the rotational energy overcoming the resistance of the surface that it is contacting, whereas on the grippy surface, the domino is forced to rotate about the position it landed on since the domino does not impart enough energy on it's rotational axis to induce the slide. Since friction is working against the rotation (forces are in the opposite direction of the rotation) it can be said that energy is lost along the rotating plane on the frictional surface. And therefore friction along this rotational surface is acting much like a brake would. This would account for while the dominoes on the slippery surface, they kick back more than the dominoes on the grippy surface. As a result of this energy loss there is less forward potential kinetic energy and the overall system travels just slightly slower on the grippy surface than on the slippery surface.\\n\\nFriction in this setting appears to act like that of rolling a tennis ball on a glass surface versus a turf surface on slopes that matched in slope angle and slope length. The tennis ball will roll faster down the glass slope than down the turf slope, since the energy imparted by friction is greater in the turf slope, the remaining potential energy that can be converted into kinetic energy will be reduced... Both systems have equal potential energies at the beginning of the experiment, but friction will limit the speed of the ball between the two experiments. I hypothesize that this is the case here as well.\\n\\nHowever it could be a combination of both of these factors, or neither of them at all! thanks for reading and i look forward to finding a solution soon!",0,0

96LawfHPh6s,"first, I grew up with dominos so I really enjoyed this. ¬†as for the testing, I suggest a pendulum (with round metal ball) to use as the starting force to topple first domino. ¬†two reasons: you get the consistency of gravity, and you can control the impact by how far back you draw the weight. ¬†This should help you control two things in one simple tool: consistency of initial impact, and starting speed of first domino (which may help reach the ramp up speed faster). ¬†I suggest the pendulum string be several feet tall (for more granular control and more horizontal impact) and the release of the drawn back weight be controlled with a electromagnet. ¬†the backdrop should be a grid so you can accurately measure the various draws later. ¬†also, the ball should impact the first domino at the exact spot where a previous domino would strike, and the weight of the pendulum ball should be equal to the weight of one domino. ¬†also, the pendulum string (when at rest) should be slightly ahead of the first domino to mimic the angle of impact of the would-be previous domino (slightly downward angle at POI). ¬†there are micro flaws in this approach, but I think its close enough without having to break out some high tech equipment that may not be lying around in your garage :)",0,0

96LawfHPh6s,The most consistent method of triggering a domino set-up is via a servo or  pneumatic air piston.  Tricky part about the piston is that you'll need one that operates at lower pressures to slow the shaft; or install a limit stop that prevents the piston from pushing further than its initial contact with the domino.,0,0

96LawfHPh6s,"I'm no expert at science, but my hypothesis is that the dominoes with less friction fall faster BECAUSE they slip backwards, they fall faster. If the dominoes pivot from the corner without slipping, it has a greater distance to travel because of the length of the radius from it's pivot point. But if the bottom slips out, the force of gravity causes the piece to accelerate downward towards the surface much faster. I'm thinking of an example where someone slips on ice versus if they plant their feet on  carpet and let themselves fall forward with their toes as their pivot - slipping on ice would cause them to hit the ground much faster. I know I'm only targeting a very specific part of the puzzle, but I hope my 2 cents helps!

96LawfHPh6s,"In my view the domino chain speed is a function of spacing, stone rotation and speed. The ideal spacing is as small as possible but still provides the energy to just knock the next stone over. The stone rotation is determined by its moment of inertia and Steiner's theorem. The moment of inertia is determined by mass and geometry and floor friction determines the pivot axis and results in Steiner's theorem. This rotation determines where the stone will have the required energy. Stone speed is determined by falling height, stone-to-stone friction as well as air resistance. This looks like floor friction wouldn't matter as it is compensated by the ideal spacing while stone-to-stone friction and air resistance does matter as it determines the speed by which the next contact can be made. This makes a lot of sense as a chain of dominos is locally static but transmits information along the way, thus it is not influenced by friction against the outside world (the floor) but only by the friction inside the system. Conclusion, given you use identical stones, focus on ideal spacing and minimal stone-to-stone friction...in a vacuum ;)",0,0

Please come see and help me share it with others. There's HOPE! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v67V3KtaSno",0,0

It‚Äôs called the microbiome. There is a connection with gut bacteria and brain function as well as health. On top of that we need to deal with the high energy electromagnetic waves making everyone go blind as it passes through the optic nerve and permanently damages the nerves ability to transmit signals. There is the problem of DNA damage as well. If we can somehow get the metal inside the planet hot and spinning we may be able to create a magnetic barrier from the sun.

The dickishness of this audience was intentional.\\n1:34 Of course they would. A crowd of rowdy dumbasses like that? And they need to so the killer can get away with stabbing Jada Pinkett Smith.\\n1:45 The voice chanjjger was obviously collected as evidence.\\n3:03 You said it yourself: they're a bigger bag of dicks than a bag of dicks.\\n3:14 He just would've done something else!\\n8:03 One of the most important staples of the Scream movies is that the killer is always someone with an obsession with movies.\\n8:11 OF COURSE movie has time for such an important scene. This movie was partially based on the fear between genders. Men are afraid that women will laugh at them, and women are afraid that men will kill them. This scene shows that Derek isn't afraid to be laughed at, proving that he can't be the killer.\\n9:00 Of course he's a laughable cop! That's why we love him! Or, perhaps he gets that Randy is a film geek who knows movies in the same way as the killer, and already survived one killing spree. _Or_ perhaps Dewey's gullibility is merely meant to lower peoples' expectations, thus enhancing his ability to effectively maneuver within any given situation.\\n3:12 Okay Jeremy, now you're just making shit up to sin.\\n15:09 He's still trying to talk to Sidney. Maybe to apologize this time.\\n15:19 She saw lights on.\\n17:27 He obviously saw Gale getting kidnapped and followed.\\n\\nActual Sin Tally: 113",0,0

jmc7aUVKCMA,I think they need a spinning circular disk to recreate earths gravity to help the heart pump blood and not allow blood to pool in the head. We should slowly release that over time and force inhabitants to adapt. We also need to bring bacteria from earth and help it survive in the soil of mars as we grow food there. It‚Äôs called the microbiome. There is a connection with gut bacteria and brain function as well as health. On top of that we need to deal with the high energy electromagnetic waves making everyone go blind as it passes through the optic nerve and permanently damages the nerves ability to transmit signals. There is the problem of DNA damage as well. If we can somehow get the metal inside the planet hot and spinning we may be able to create a magnetic barrier from the sun. We take earth for granted so much.,0,0

jmc7aUVKCMA,Let's do this!,0,0
jmc7aUVKCMA,"BFR - Big Failure Rocket. Or Big Faulty Rocket.Possible. In fact that will be future. But obviously not like Musk propose on this presentation. The craft will not be actualy a rocket. But all in one solution. Pretty much like milenium falcon. DTOL - Diagonal take off and Landing. Combine that with the ekranoplan technology from the cold war period and you have it. Electrical air craft using wing in ground effect. it will take off diagonally at 45 degree angle and definetely will not go to orbit. Will fly low to the surface. Smooth acceleration and deceleration.\\nIf you want to go in outer cosmos - boost the speed up and climb higher. Several propulsion systems combined. UART,electrical turbines,centrifugal systems,ION engines. It will have also tungsten carbide hull with carbon fiber mesh.\\nIt will have reverse thrust,electromagnetic shield to repell the radiation. In fact the solar wind,the gamma and xrays as well as any possible particles, even subatomic particles can be used as propellant. Basicly the ship will act as giant vacuum cleaner,compressor and accelerator. It will look much more like star destroyer than a rocket. Of course we cant raise the money instantly to develop such craft at once. But that technologies are simply upgrades to the ekronaplan technology. And i have a power source methods which i call paradox power. PV cells are built in, not ouside the ship. No outside parts at all.\\nMy model i named —É—Ä–∞–≥–∞–Ω which on english means hurricane. Hyper turbines,ultra turbines. Not just turbines.\\nTriangular shape. Very similar to star destroyer but without the top bridge. More like super star destroyer. Of course not that big. At leas first versions will not be that much big. First model will be 70 meters long,40 meters wide and 14 meters high at the highest point. Bonus - it will act as seaship and submarine as well. Then a ticket of 10 dolars can be achieved. And the ship will be extremely reusable.",0,0

hM_kejkWeHU,"here's some more accurate lyrics:\\n[Verse 1]\\nIt ain't no wonder why we lose control\\nWhen we're always heart attack away from falling in love\\nWell, I know that we've been hardly holding on\\nTo tell the truth, I can't believe we got this far\\nRunning near on empty\\nI wish somebody would've told me\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nThat I'd end up so caught up in need of your demons\\nThat I'd be lost without you leading me astray\\nGuess that I'm a fool for the way that you caught me\\nGirl, you make my heart break more every day\\nBut don't fade away\\n\\n[Verse 2]\\nAnd when I'm just about to pass the point of it all\\nYou come ripping all the air from out of my lungs\\nAnd now it's so hard to be\\nI wish somebody would've told me\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nThat I'd end up so caught up in need of your demons\\nThat I'd be lost without you leading me astray\\nGuess that I'm a fool for the way that you caught me\\nGirl, you make my heart break more every day\\n\\n[Bridge]\\nWell, I know that we've been hardly holding on\\nTo tell the truth, I can't believe we got this far, oh\\nWell, I know that we've been hardly holding on\\nTo tell the truth, I can't believe we got this far\\nI wish somebody would've told me\\nI wish somebody would've told me\\n\\n[Chorus]\\nThat I'd end up so caught up in need of your demons\\nThat I'd be lost without you leading me astray\\nGuess I'm such a fucking fool for the way that you caught me\\nGirl, you make my heart break more every day\\n\\n[Outro]\\nBut don't fade away (well, I know that we've been hardly holding on)\\nTo tell the truth, I can't believe we got this far\\nDon't fade away (well, I know that we've been hardly holding on)\\nTo tell the truth, I can't believe we got this far\\nSo don't fade away",1,0

TP0PsCb371E,"Donald Trump is the continuation of the Bush presidency. Joseph Schmitz was a top executive for Blackwater now renamed Academi and was Inspector General for the Department of Defense under the Bush Administration. While Inspector General he investigated human trafficking and produced no results. He resigned. Joseph Schmitz is a member of Rome's Sovereign Military Order of Malta, Jesuit Georgetown professor and has worked as an adviser for Trump's presidential campaign. Donald Trump, Eric Trump, and Ivanka Trump were all Jesuit educated as well. Erik Prince was the founder of Blackwater and comes from a wealthy family that sold their company to Johnson Controls for over 1.3 billion. The sister of Erik Prince is Betsy DeVos who is US Secretary of Education under Trump's administration. Her husband is Dick DeVos and their father is Richard DeVos who is worth over 5 billion as co-founder of Amway and owner of the Orlando Magic NBA team. Jay Van Andel was a co-founder of Amway as well and he donated 2 million to George W Bush's reelection through Progress of America. \\n\\nDonald Trump has been continuing the war in Afghanistan and his military advisers have been considering ideas from Erik Prince involving the use a private military. Stephen A. Schwarzman chaired for Trump's Strategic and Policy forum and was educated at Yale and was a member of Skull and Bones at the time George Walker Bush also a Skull and Bones member was enrolled at Yale. Trump has Rick Perry as his Secretary of Energy who was former Governor of Texas and prior Lieutenant Governor of Texas under George Walker Bush. They used the Texan Alex Jones who is the leader of the COINTELPRO Alternative Media to transform the Libertarian opposition against corruption into a Neo-Fascist movement that worships Donald Trump. Donald Trump is running a Right Wing Neo-Fascist political movement in the United States. Online Neo-Fascist attempt to dominate public opinion by censoring others as they prop themselves up. They accuse anyone who opposes Trump of being a Liberal and socialist. They threaten civil war every time that Trump loses favor in the polls. They are a relatively small group trying to stir up violence and use intimidation to get their way which is terrorism. The Bush family are the ones running the Trump Administration and they work closely with the European royal families and Vatican. George Walker Bush is the highest authority in the United States and a mass murdering war criminal, persecutor, and ruthless tyrant.",0,0

As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens.

In reality he didn‚Äôt produce  a single point on offense because his lone TD pass would‚Äôve been intercepted by a better safety that can judge the ball better.  The Vikings waited far too long to yank Bradford and they wasted the entire first half on someone who couldn‚Äôt even move.  The Viking‚Äôs defense bailed out the offense yet again.",0,0

If the coaches allowed Trubisky to throw it more I believe this could have been a different game. Also, receivers are total garbage and I still hate how they got rid of Alshon... Next year once we get rid of Fox's over-conservative ass and draft some decent WRs, we will become a decent threat in the NFL. For now, I say keep Trubisky get what you can, hopefully a wild card, if not simply prepare for a better season with a new coach.",0,0

P_X6hIyqUxA,"The Bears have GOT to get some receivers. Bring Gentry back up or sign Cruz. The best thing about the Packers and their receiving core is they can understand Rodgers and break off a predesigned route into open field away from the designed coverage (because they know Rodgers can get the ball to them). The Bears receivers do none of that. Miller had to be motion directed from Trubisky with the entire defense watching him JUST to go the other way where there was literally no-one within 10 yards for that touchdown pass. I'm sorry but in those instances you have to use your brain and your awareness to make those adjustments. If the play fell apart and went unscripted, the receivers just moved around in the exact same area waiting for the throw because he happened to be scrambling there way. The receivers had no space between them and the defender. ¬†I like the elements Trubisky can bring to the Bears. With that said, he has to fine tune his awareness some more yet. ¬†There were quite a few times where the pressure got to him and he tried to force some passes that didn't need to be when he should have thrown it away or let them get the sack. I realize it's his first game, and I thought he did a pretty good job, but there's still a lot of work ahead yet to get everyone on the same page.",0,0

It's not enough data or tape, to look at those two resumes.. and determine that Trubisky was the better player of the two. Especially, if QB evaluation is based off meritocracy, and not inherent prejudices. \\n\\nBut I will say. The young brother Mitch is a much better fit and QB than Glennon is for this team. The average weapons on the outside, makes it hard for a dude with that limited skill set, to be affective in this offense. Or any offense, that doesn't have elite o line play, or great talent at the WR position. Showing you how much Glennon stinks.",0,0

Joseph Schmitz is a member of Rome's Sovereign Military Order of Malta, Jesuit Georgetown professor and has worked as an adviser for Trump's presidential campaign. Donald Trump, Eric Trump, and Ivanka Trump were all Jesuit educated as well. Erik Prince was the founder of Blackwater and comes from a wealthy family that sold their company to Johnson Controls for over 1.3 billion. The sister of Erik Prince is Betsy DeVos who is US Secretary of Education under Trump's administration. Her husband is Dick DeVos and their father is Richard DeVos who is worth over 5 billion as co-founder of Amway and owner of the Orlando Magic NBA team. Jay Van Andel was a co-founder of Amway as well and he donated 2 million to George W Bush's reelection through Progress of America. \\n\\nDonald Trump has been continuing the war in Afghanistan and his military advisers have been considering ideas from Erik Prince involving the use a private military. Stephen A.

Trump has Rick Perry as his Secretary of Energy who was former Governor of Texas and prior Lieutenant Governor of Texas under George Walker Bush. They used the Texan Alex Jones who is the leader of the COINTELPRO Alternative Media to transform the Libertarian opposition against corruption into a Neo-Fascist movement that worships Donald Trump. Donald Trump is running a Right Wing Neo-Fascist political movement in the United States. Online Neo-Fascist attempt to dominate public opinion by censoring others as they prop themselves up. They accuse anyone who opposes Trump of being a Liberal and socialist. They threaten civil war every time that Trump loses favor in the polls. They are a relatively small group trying to stir up violence and use intimidation to get their way which is terrorism. The Bush family are the ones running the Trump Administration and they work closely with the European royal families and Vatican.

I mean aside from having all this talent behind it...Lin Manuel-Miranda basically wrote a Sondheim style song. The lyrics are just basically the towns/cities in Puerto Rico but the order in which they are done is an astounding lyrical tongue twister. The sampling from West Side Story is obviously a nod to Sondheim but the rest of the song is done as if Lin was trying to keep the Sondheim theme heavy in the rest of it as well. <3 He did it perfectly and some parts of this song I am determined to learn how to sing just because of how my tongue keeps getting twisted as I try.",1,0

rfMJ-DylWBs,"everyone is complaining about how Cinema Sins tends to sin really good movies and that they tend to nit pick, but most people fail to notice that if a movie being sinned is really good, it will tend to have a LOT of sins compared to a bad movie.

Whenever CinemaSins gets REALLY nit-picky about something, it probably just means that they enjoyed the movie so much they needed to either come up with jokey sins or that they had the patience/attention-span to analyze the scene.

P_X6hIyqUxA,"The Bears have GOT to get some receivers. Bring Gentry back up or sign Cruz. The best thing about the Packers and their receiving core is they can understand Rodgers and break off a predesigned route into open field away from the designed coverage (because they know Rodgers can get the ball to them). The Bears receivers do none of that. Miller had to be motion directed from Trubisky with the entire defense watching him JUST to go the other way where there was literally no-one within 10 yards for that touchdown pass. I'm sorry but in those instances you have to use your brain and your awareness to make those adjustments. If the play fell apart and went unscripted, the receivers just moved around in the exact same area waiting for the throw because he happened to be scrambling there way. The receivers had no space between them and the defender. ¬†I like the elements Trubisky can bring to the Bears. With that said, he has to fine tune his awareness some more yet. ¬†There were quite a few times where the pressure got to him and he tried to force some passes that didn't need to be when he should have thrown it away or let them get the sack. I realize it's his first game, and I thought he did a pretty good job, but there's still a lot of work ahead yet to get everyone on the same page.",0,0

Next year once we get rid of Fox's over-conservative ass and draft some decent WRs, we will become a decent threat in the NFL. For now, I say keep Trubisky get what you can, hopefully a wild card, if not simply prepare for a better season with a new coach.",1,0

In reality he didn‚Äôt produce  a single point on offense because his lone TD pass would‚Äôve been intercepted by a better safety that can judge the ball better.

She said the promoters would not let her give them out before 1am, by then we were boiling hot and pissed off watching people cut in down the line.

Fast-forward to the beginning of 2016, I heard a night cored version of your song 'A Paper Crown'. I've had, for the most part, your songs on repeat since then. You are an incredible artist, I want you to know that your songs, and you as a person, mean so much to us {your fans}. All of your songs tell a different, vibrant, and meaningful story, and they are each unique. Each one causes me to beam, as I think of the meaning, and it {your song(s)} really makes you think about the beautiful things in life. It makes me look back, and think of how incredible our world is. So, thank you to the moon and back, and I want to say that I'm forever grateful to you.

P_X6hIyqUxA,"Too many running plays the Bears should have focused more on passing. I was sick of seeing long third downs because 2 draws to Cohen only nabbed 3 yards. If the coaches allowed Trubisky to throw it more I believe this could have been a different game. Also, receivers are total garbage and I still hate how they got rid of Alshon... Next year once we get rid of Fox's over-conservative ass and draft some decent WRs, we will become a decent threat in the NFL. For now, I say keep Trubisky get what you can, hopefully a wild card, if not simply prepare for a better season with a new coach.",1,0

In reality he didn‚Äôt produce  a single point on offense because his lone TD pass would‚Äôve been intercepted by a better safety that can judge the ball better.

CX4KuIBmnjI,"Hey! We're so excited to share our first ever 360¬∞ video. Here's how you can view it:\\n\\nIf you have access to a Google Cardboard viewer and a smart phone:\\n1. Open this video in the YouTube app on your phone.\\n2. Hit pause on the video.\\n3. Tap the 3 vertical dots on the top right corner of the view window. This will slide up a sub-menu where you will choose the quality setting of your video stream. Choose 2160s. Note that if you are not streaming over Wifi, YouTube will only allow 720s quality.\\n4. Tap on the ‚ÄúCardboard viewer‚Äù icon on the bottom row of the video window (it looks like a mask). This will present the video full screen in prep for the Cardboard viewer.\\n5. The screen is now divided into 2 halves, separated by a thin white line that runs halfway up the screen. Make sure to rotate your phone so that this thin line is coming from the bottom of the screen. This ensures proper stereoscopic depth.\\n6. Insert your phone into the Cardboard viewer and press play. The video will begin. Enjoy!\\n\\nIf you do not have access to a Cardboard or smart phone:\\n1. You can watch on your browser. Use your mouse to drag and explore the space above, below, and behind you. Enjoy!",348,29

Next year once we get rid of Fox's over-conservative ass and draft some decent WRs, we will become a decent threat in the NFL.

In reality he didn‚Äôt produce  a single point on offense because his lone TD pass would‚Äôve been intercepted by a better safety that can judge the ball better.

Then, the video started.\\n\\nI was in shock. But not good OR bad shock. Part of me was still processing what he had just said. Another part was SO mad.

CX4KuIBmnjI,"Hey! We're so excited to share our first ever 360¬∞ video. Here's how you can view it:\\n\\nIf you have access to a Google Cardboard viewer and a smart phone:\\n1. Open this video in the YouTube app on your phone.\\n2. Hit pause on the video.\\n3. Tap the 3 vertical dots on the top right corner of the view window. This will slide up a sub-menu where you will choose the quality setting of your video stream. Choose 2160s. Note that if you are not streaming over Wifi, YouTube will only allow 720s quality.\\n4. Tap on the ‚ÄúCardboard viewer‚Äù icon on the bottom row of the video window (it looks like a mask). This will present the video full screen in prep for the Cardboard viewer.\\n5. The screen is now divided into 2 halves, separated by a thin white line that runs halfway up the screen. Make sure to rotate your phone so that this thin line is coming from the bottom of the screen. This ensures proper stereoscopic depth.\\n6. Insert your phone into the Cardboard viewer and press play. The video will begin. Enjoy!\\n\\nIf you do not have access to a Cardboard or smart phone:\\n1. You can watch on your browser. Use your mouse to drag and explore the space above, below, and behind you. Enjoy!",370,30

P_X6hIyqUxA,"I mean at least they got the touchdown first, which is most important. But, a lot of these teams are so worried about the few seconds of celebration that they're not getting the points. It goes to show why teams like Green Bay are just that much better and are held at such a higher standard. They are worried about getting points and winning the game. (Not a Packers fan). Celebrations-cool, losing the points because you're setting up the celebration before you get into the endzone-horrible.",0,0

P_X6hIyqUxA,"Too many running plays the Bears should have focused more on passing. I was sick of seeing long third downs because 2 draws to Cohen only nabbed 3 yards. If the coaches allowed Trubisky to throw it more I believe this could have been a different game. Also, receivers are total garbage and I still hate how they got rid of Alshon... Next year once we get rid of Fox's over-conservative ass and draft some decent WRs, we will become a decent threat in the NFL. For now, I say keep Trubisky get what you can, hopefully a wild card, if not simply prepare for a better season with a new coach.",1,0

His decision making was poor and he should have been picked off 2 more times.  In reality he didn‚Äôt produce  a single point on offense because his lone TD pass would‚Äôve been intercepted by a better safety that can judge the ball better.  The Vikings waited far too long to yank Bradford and they wasted the entire first half on someone who couldn‚Äôt even move.  The Viking‚Äôs defense bailed out the offense yet again.",0,0

CX4KuIBmnjI,"Hey! We're so excited to share our first ever 360¬∞ video. Here's how you can view it:\\n\\nIf you have access to a Google Cardboard viewer and a smart phone:\\n1. Open this video in the YouTube app on your phone.\\n2. Hit pause on the video.\\n3. Tap the 3 vertical dots on the top right corner of the view window. This will slide up a sub-menu where you will choose the quality setting of your video stream. Choose 2160s. Note that if you are not streaming over Wifi, YouTube will only allow 720s quality.\\n4. Tap on the ‚ÄúCardboard viewer‚Äù icon on the bottom row of the video window (it looks like a mask). This will present the video full screen in prep for the Cardboard viewer.\\n5. The screen is now divided into 2 halves, separated by a thin white line that runs halfway up the screen. Make sure to rotate your phone so that this thin line is coming from the bottom of the screen. This ensures proper stereoscopic depth.\\n6. Insert your phone into the Cardboard viewer and press play. The video will begin. Enjoy!\\n\\nIf you do not have access to a Cardboard or smart phone:\\n1. You can watch on your browser. Use your mouse to drag and explore the space above, below, and behind you. Enjoy!",390,30

Open this video in the YouTube app on your phone.\\n2. Hit pause on the video.\\n3. Tap the 3 vertical dots on the top right corner of the view window. This will slide up a sub-menu where you will choose the quality setting of your video stream. Choose 2160s. Note that if you are not streaming over Wifi, YouTube will only allow 720s quality.\\n4. Tap on the ‚ÄúCardboard viewer‚Äù icon on the bottom row of the video window (it looks like a mask). This will present the video full screen in prep for the Cardboard viewer.\\n5. The screen is now divided into 2 halves, separated by a thin white line that runs halfway up the screen. Make sure to rotate your phone so that this thin line is coming from the bottom of the screen. This ensures proper stereoscopic depth.\\n6. Insert your phone into the Cardboard viewer and press play. The video will begin.

VVYhDFiTvqU,"Why I think this song sends the wrong message: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to be invincible‚Äù. Here‚Äôs what this song says to me: Lighten up. It‚Äôs ok to fail. Nobody is perfect and perfection is not to be expected. Just be yourself and all will be ok. While this appeals to our humanity, it isn‚Äôt the message I find in the Bible. There I find a great spiritual battle taking place where failure ends in defeat. We are to rest in Jesus, meaning being comfortable with what He is doing in us to transform us into His sinless, loving and caring image. This cannot be done using human strength alone, but requires the ever present creative power of an all powerful God. Love, trust, faith, total submission. ‚ÄúI will write my law in your heart and in your mind.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your mind, with all your strength.‚Äù When we fail, we go straight to Jesus and ask Him to strengthen us so that our character becomes stronger.\\n\\nIf I‚Äôm thinking instead, I don‚Äôt have to be invincible, what I‚Äôm actually telling myself is, it‚Äôs ok to be and to remain a sinful human because that‚Äôs all I‚Äôll ever be anyway. Jesus says to ‚ÄúGo and sin no more.‚Äù To me, that‚Äôs the complete opposite of I don‚Äôt have to be invincible. A satanic message hidden inside a song that appeals to our fallen sinful nature.",0,0

VVYhDFiTvqU,"Why I think this song sends the wrong message: ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to be invincible‚Äù. Here‚Äôs what this song says to me: Lighten up. It‚Äôs ok to fail. Nobody is perfect and perfection is not to be expected. Just be yourself and all will be ok. While this appeals to our humanity, it isn‚Äôt the message I find in the Bible. There I find a great spiritual battle taking place where failure ends in defeat. We are to rest in Jesus, meaning being comfortable with what He is doing in us to transform us into His sinless, loving and caring image. This cannot be done using human strength alone, but requires the ever present creative power of an all powerful God. Love, trust, faith, total submission. ‚ÄúI will write my law in your heart and in your mind.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your mind, with all your strength.‚Äù When we fail, we go straight to Jesus and ask Him to strengthen us so that our character becomes stronger.\\n\\nIf I‚Äôm thinking instead, I don‚Äôt have to be invincible, what I‚Äôm actually telling myself is, it‚Äôs ok to be and to remain a sinful human because that‚Äôs all I‚Äôll ever be anyway. Jesus says to ‚ÄúGo and sin no more.‚Äù To me, that‚Äôs the complete opposite of I don‚Äôt have to be invincible. A satanic message hidden inside a song that appeals to our fallen sinful nature.",0,0

xRQGzS6Ce-g,"Can't people keep political correctness out of their movie judgements? I read so many critiques of movies where people moralize upon whether the movie has a socially responsible message. That's not what art or food for the mind is. Thirty years from now people will think we were a bunch of suckholes in the year 2017.¬†\\nI used to really like Cracked..................... I just read an article about this movie....... They are horrified by the show! They end off the article with, Is it the best timing?\\nTiming? F off! You want artists and comedians on leashes? Repressing them will get a preferable 'product' for you? That is what you suckholes think art and comedy is... a Product to mould the minds of the people in our culture. That is such B.S. \\nMan... are people ever turning into the thought police lately.¬†\\nThat kills Humour. Humour is about pushing boundaries.................................................................................................................................................................................. and pain.¬†\\nIt kills creativity too because creativity is all about the freedom of the mind...... Seeing things in another way.\\nIf you see things in another way you are going to run into troubles with the people that want top control how we can create? \\nF. U. Cracked..... Louis C.K. is awesome.\\nI would write this on Cracked's page but I can't get onto it. They won't accept me for some reason.¬†\\nI don't know the specifics about his sex scandal that the writer referred to but I've read Sarah Silverman's memoir and there is a chapter that sounds like the same sort of thing. Wasn't it with the group of people doing comedy? Releasing all of their freedom and acting like animals? At Sarah Silverman's show the writers were constantly showing their penises. Putting shrimp on them and making skits with them and Sarah Silverman is loving it. Comedians do things that sound shocking and push the boundaries but that is different than sexual assault?\\nMyself even! I remember I was in an improv skit and I stuck a dildo into my friend's mouth. I didn't really mean to do it. The audience just needed something and we were kind of dying, (I'm not really a performer) so I stuck this dildo that was there in his mouth. People gasped. It was something. It got kind of sicker and sicker and the gasps continued. Things like that happen. My friend was mad at me but he understood. He was fine later. Did I sexually assault my friend? He didn't like it and I only feel bad about it twenty years later......\\nThe creative life can be crazy making but that's not Harvey Weinstein. He's not a creator.¬†\\nHe's the business guy that gets them made and his allegations are way way worse. Another planet Janet. \\nHe had a position of power.\\nLouis C.K. didn't either I presume because it was during a comedy frenzy wasn't it?\\nI shouldn't blame Cracked. I like Cracked. Some of the people in Cracked are super but there are a few people that just sound so in favour of politically correct repression of the mind. I guess they have to hire those types because the world is turning sucky now. They know there's bigger numbers in those people but you won't be able to be so funny with all the repression.\\nPeople can't tell the difference between Weinstein and Louis? That's just dumb.\\nSure... I'll follow the new rule of politeness and modify my rude behaviour if it offends anyone. I'm friendly. No problem... but stay away from art and movies... you people that call yourselves judges.\\nShow less\\nREPLY",0,0

Hypocrisy.\\n\\nAnd if psychobabble is real, then any behavior is understood thru its lens ...not just when wimmin cut off penises.
