ppGCbh8ggUs,"not sure if this video is purposely misleading or not, but from what I've learned Spartan heiresses inherited half, to less than half, of that which was divided among male children. Spartan heiresses could not determine who they married. It was arranged by some sort of guardian or ruling body, not by themselves. Once married, a Spartan heiress' inheritance would be granted to the control of her husband - the catch is, he would most likely be at war, training for war, or investing himself in politics, far too busy to run household business. \\n\\nHowever Athenian scholars have suggested that it was Spartan women who contributed to the demise of Sparta herself. As inheritance grew, so did entitlement, and women married later and later, sometimes choosing to not have children at all. To a diminishing Sparta outnumbered (as I've heard) up to 10-to-1, this was a death knoll. Lack innovation. Lack of conscription. Xenophobia. Fear of trade. Women who the Greeks considered overly entitled and outright unruly, thus slowing, if not halting all together the supply of Spartan stock... everything was a powder keg. \\n\\nBegrudgingly, Spartans had to eventually let Helots join their military ranks just to fill the gaps. And then... there were nearly as many helot warriors trained up as Spartans as their were Spartan citizens. A unique, but over all failure of a government strategy. Yes they created the first constitution. Yes the practiced oligarchy, democracy, aristocracy and duoarchy at the same time - kinda reminds me of the States. Yes the Spartan government lasted longer than Athenian democracy (also a huge failure). But No, no, no, could Sparta sustain itself. It did good for like, what, 400 years? But little room for growth or upward mobility. Shame.",0,0

ppGCbh8ggUs,"the spartans had slaves that allowed the entire population to live like aristocracy and devote their time to war. We have so much technology that much of what is needed to run a society is done my machines overseen by a few people. We could use this to shorten the average work week to something like ten hours but capitalism lives off growth and would never allow this. there will always be new jobs until we implement a universal basic income. we could be the new spartans. we could live like kings off the fruits of our technology. sure, some work still needs to be done but not as much as is currently being done. 60% of people in britain believe their job is actually unnecessary.\\n\\nwhen self driving cars take all the jobs from truck drivers and taxi drivers, capitalism will create new jobs for them or leave them unemployed and in poverty. what if instead we realised that we have less work to do as a society and the same amount of people. implement a UBI and allow people to work less. \\n\\nhumanity has pushed the frontiers of science and technology for thousands of years. its time to relax and live off the fruits of our labour.\\n\\nif you ask people what they would do with a universal basic income nearly everyone has an idea of something productive they would do. maybe theyd do charity work or start a business or study. if you ask people what other people would do with a UBI, nearly everyone responds the same theyd just spend it on cigarettes and alcohol. theyre wrong.\\n\\nCapitalism is not the future and communism is not the only alternative. the time is ripe for a UBI",0,0

ppGCbh8ggUs,"The Spartan decline is due to the Thebans under Epaminondas freeing the helots of messania from their captive state. The Thebans decisively defeated the spartans at the battle of Leuctra, and marched on into their heartlands. While not being able to conquer Sparta itself, Epaminondas moved into Messenia and freed the helots there. This was a third of Sparta's land, and about half of the helot population. To make sure the Messenians would remain a free people he rebuild the city of Messene, and with it build some of the strongest fortifications in all of Greece.\\n\\nWhile Epaminondas died a few years later and Thebe as a major power with him, the Spartans never recovered from this defeat. It meant that the Spartans could no longer field there entire male population as an army, for the simple reason that there were not enough helots to feed and supply them. It was also a huge moral defeat, as both the Spartans as the rest of the Greeks no longer saw the Spartan army as invincible. It has to be remembered that the massive loss of land counts for much as well. For example the 'heiresses' could no longer uphold their wealth if a third of their land or more was suddenly no longer in their possesion. This meant that not only did the spartans lose their ability to field a massive army, they also lost the power to fund it.\\n\\nWhile this does not completely account for the MASSIVE loss in influence and manpower, it  was without a doubt the start of the decline. It was probably, as you said, that they were not willing to change their ways after losing half of their helot/worker population",0,0

ppGCbh8ggUs,"22:20 \\n\\nI think you answered you own question in this video. Because Sparta raised it's soldiers from men who owned plots of land provided by the government, the less land owners the less soldiers. And because over centuries these lands accumulated to wealthy families it meant there was less public land to distribute and less soldiers to raise.\\n\\nThey couldn't alter the course of this accumulation of wealth because of the conservative nature of the government. \\n\\nPretty similar to what happened to Rome. Strong army in the beginning by giving it's male citizens plots of land and raising them into an army but then the wealth accumulated and the armies weakened. \\n\\nI quess it's difficult to avoid that phenomena of accumulating wealth and through that power to a small part of the population because those who could stop this are the ones benefitting. So basically the greed of a few made these empires collapse.\\n\\nMaybe this tells something about what happens when you can inherit great wealth. Wealth accumulates and along that power. Then the government that was supposed to look after the nation is primarily concerned with their personal wealth.\\n\\nWhat could've the government done? Well nothing really. If even a considerable portion them would've wanted a reform to distribute public lands again it would've required majority. If the king wanted it he would've basically needed the other king to murder the elders together to make it happen. And even then what is the backlash to such an action? Civil war would be highly likely. The two kings would have to enforce their laws by force. And what after? Would they reinstitute the same system or work as 2 kings. The 2 king system is definitely ending with a civil war or an assassination to form a dictatorship. \\n\\nSo it doesn't really seem like there was any other course that this form of government was going to go through with that structure.",0,0

I think that those were interesting points to be considered: a geographical power whose only strength was it's military capabilities having said capabilities cut short led to an eventual downfall, that the pride and lack of reforms made sure to continue.\\n\\nLastly, archaic freaks or achaean-c freaks?

To force sobriety they would accuse one another of undeclared wealth which would force them to pay for the city's infrastructure and reforms. They wasted tons of money trying to hide it so they weren't particularly keen to the rigurous system, but it was their city so while this was true they didn't care. The Spartans had an excelent system but it was too expensive.\\n\\nTheir problem was like any other greek kingdom. Economics. The  fall of the Delian League left the Spartans with too much land to rule under a centurial system concieved for just the Peloponnese. This created political instability, poor quality foreign governments and eventually famine, with the exception of Macedon, Greece became a shadow of its former self.\\n\\nSurrounded by a cilmate of dire economic conditions the Spartans unable to support the growing inflation suddenly percieved the life outside of the strict highly expenssive Spartan society was increasingly more appealing, and began to leave the city for a live of carelessness who gets it keeps it free for all, until eventually were but some few thousand men inside Sparta to keep it safe.",0,0

Also I think a distinction should be made between Laconian Helots and Messenian Helots, the former were always more loyal as Sparta was their state.

ppGCbh8ggUs,"not sure if this video is purposely misleading or not, but from what I've learned Spartan heiresses inherited half, to less than half, of that which was divided among male children. Spartan heiresses could not determine who they married. It was arranged by some sort of guardian or ruling body, not by themselves. Once married, a Spartan heiress' inheritance would be granted to the control of her husband - the catch is, he would most likely be at war, training for war, or investing himself in politics, far too busy to run household business. \\n\\nHowever Athenian scholars have suggested that it was Spartan women who contributed to the demise of Sparta herself. As inheritance grew, so did entitlement, and women married later and later, sometimes choosing to not have children at all. To a diminishing Sparta outnumbered (as I've heard) up to 10-to-1, this was a death knoll. Lack innovation. Lack of conscription. Xenophobia. Fear of trade. Women who the Greeks considered overly entitled and outright unruly, thus slowing, if not halting all together the supply of Spartan stock... everything was a powder keg. \\n\\nBegrudgingly, Spartans had to eventually let Helots join their military ranks just to fill the gaps. And then... there were nearly as many helot warriors trained up as Spartans as their were Spartan citizens. A unique, but over all failure of a government strategy. Yes they created the first constitution. Yes the practiced oligarchy, democracy, aristocracy and duoarchy at the same time - kinda reminds me of the States. Yes the Spartan government lasted longer than Athenian democracy (also a huge failure). But No, no, no, could Sparta sustain itself. It did good for like, what, 400 years? But little room for growth or upward mobility. Shame.",0,0

ppGCbh8ggUs,"22:20 \\n\\nI think you answered you own question in this video. Because Sparta raised it's soldiers from men who owned plots of land provided by the government, the less land owners the less soldiers. And because over centuries these lands accumulated to wealthy families it meant there was less public land to distribute and less soldiers to raise.\\n\\nThey couldn't alter the course of this accumulation of wealth because of the conservative nature of the government. \\n\\nPretty similar to what happened to Rome. Strong army in the beginning by giving it's male citizens plots of land and raising them into an army but then the wealth accumulated and the armies weakened. \\n\\nI quess it's difficult to avoid that phenomena of accumulating wealth and through that power to a small part of the population because those who could stop this are the ones benefitting. So basically the greed of a few made these empires collapse.\\n\\nMaybe this tells something about what happens when you can inherit great wealth. Wealth accumulates and along that power. Then the government that was supposed to look after the nation is primarily concerned with their personal wealth.\\n\\nWhat could've the government done? Well nothing really. If even a considerable portion them would've wanted a reform to distribute public lands again it would've required majority. If the king wanted it he would've basically needed the other king to murder the elders together to make it happen. And even then what is the backlash to such an action? Civil war would be highly likely. The two kings would have to enforce their laws by force. And what after? Would they reinstitute the same system or work as 2 kings. The 2 king system is definitely ending with a civil war or an assassination to form a dictatorship. \\n\\nSo it doesn't really seem like there was any other course that this form of government was going to go through with that structure.",0,0

I think that those were interesting points to be considered: a geographical power whose only strength was it's military capabilities having said capabilities cut short led to an eventual downfall, that the pride and lack of reforms made sure to continue.\\n\\nLastly, archaic freaks or achaean-c freaks?

WJfeapsCnPI,"God bless the readers of this comment. I  bring you the good news of the gospel of Christ. Jesus Christ (God in the flesh / Gods son and 2nd in the Holy trinity )Loves you more Than we humans can imagine! The true and only living God  created mankind for us to love and be loved by him. But man went astray following Satans crafty lies and causing sepetation from man and God. From mankind and salvation from Sins power. The wages of sin is eternal death and damnation. Satan fell from Gods Love and Grace and became envious and corrupted by sin. God banished satan and his Angels that followed after him and created for them an eternal seperation from light and and God. Hell. Satan deceived man and made him to fall into the same sin he did and has been deceiving mankind since the beginning of creation. Satan rules this world through sin and all those who follow after this world and sinful ways will go down to the pit with their master satan. But praise be unto God!! For he saw mans affliction and with the greatest display of TRUE LOVE he made a way for us to be freed from sins damnation and power. JESUS CHRIST lived a perfect sin free life(The only human to ever do so) Scripture says he was a man and was tempted with like pleasures as we are. Even more so for satan sought always to destroy him and to make him stumble. BUT CHRIST Did not stumble! He pushed on through the pain and he took upon Himself the iniquity and sin of all mankind! He became cursed for us and took our punishment! He was ridiculed, beaten and mocked. He was perfect and loved even those who crucified him and yet he was and is to this day hated slandered and despised by mankind. All those who walk in the darkness hate the light says the scriptures. He was tortured beyond that of any man so that he was unrecognizable says the book of Isaiah.He was then crucified on the cross and died carrying upon himself the sin of all people! Father forgive them for they know not what they do were the words of Christ well hanging on the cross being mocked by his enemies and murderers. He died on the cross and was taken 3 nights and 3 days into hell. But being of no sin himself he condemned sin in the flesh defeating sin and it's power of death by RISING FROM THE DEAD AND ASCENDING UNTO THE FATHER!!! Praise Jesus! The Lord was with his disciples 40 days after rising from the dead and was seen by over 500 witness. He then told his disciples he must go unto to the father so the the HELPER (HOLY SPIRIT OF GOD. #3 in the holy trinity)may come upon them and unto all men. So now all mankind now had a way to be saved from hell and sin and death and to be loved eternally by a perfect creator in heaven for ever! The bible says this. Romans 10:9 That if thou wilt confess with your mouth thatJesus is lord and believe in your heart that God hath raised him from the dead, you shall be saved John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten son. So that whosever believe that in him ,shall not perish but have eternal life  1John 1:9 If we confess our sins, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousnesswas Acts 1:8  But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. We must then continue in His ways! Follow God with all your heart and lean not unto your own understanding. \\nPut your faith in Christ today and pray this prayer with all your heart! \\nFather, I know that I have broken your laws and my sins have separated me from you. I am truly sorry, and now I want to turn away from my past sinful life toward you. Please forgive me, and help me avoid sinning again. I believe that your son, Jesus Christ died for my sins, was resurrected from the dead, is alive, and hears my prayer. I invite Jesus to become the Lord of my life, to rule and reign in my heart from this day forward. Please send your Holy Spirit to help me obey You, and to do Your will for the rest of my life. In Jesus' name I pray, Amen.\\nJesus is coming very soon! The scriptures say so to those who have ears to hear and the signs say so to those who have eyes to see! Be blessed in Christs peace of eternal life! The rapture(harpazo) is imminent!! Caught away in a flash will be the bride of Christ! The wise virgins! The True followers of Christ will be taken into heaven in glory with Jesus Christ and then this world will get very bad.  The book of Revelation will tell you. Put your faith in Christ now! You do not want to be here for the Anti christs reign and Gods wrath.\\nJesus bless all of those who read this in your name Jesus Amen!Maranatha",0,0

God said humans will not predict when the world will end and if they do they will most likely go to hell, their verses don't even apply. I'm a christian and this is bogus. Those aren't real christians and for the people that are believing this september 23 thing\\n\\nremember 2012? YEAH THAT WAS A FUN PREDICTION \\n\\nand also you bash christians but then say the world is going to end according to the bible like do you believe it or not\\n\\nAnyways it's not happening and these sources are very wrong. Like those christian predictions are actually going to hell. \\nIf it was the end of the world this month christians would have been raptured to 7 years ago, the world would be ending 7 years. \\n\\nThe lord will come in like a thief in the night, like a blink of an eye. \\nNot a false prophet.\\nthis is insane.",0,0

YaTxVflKDQw,Kylie was basically given her business due to her family in my opinion. I would prefer to look up to someone that started from the bottom and worked there way up. Having a family that is famous and has money gives them more of a privilege to get where they want to be. It's a lot easier then someone that doesn't have that much money.,3,0

YaTxVflKDQw,Kylie didn't attend due to the bump 🤰🏻,0,0
YaTxVflKDQw,I am sorry but there is no way they have not lost touch with reality.  Admitting even they are in a 'bubble'.   They were funny and genuine the first 5 years maybe but now its just a show about snobby rich people trying to make more and more money.  They would all have a heart attack if the show would be canceled and they would lose so much attention.,0,0
YaTxVflKDQw,Plz let it be over,0,0
YaTxVflKDQw,Who else is upset about Kylie not being there?,0,0
YaTxVflKDQw,I honestly I don't hate the Kardashians they entertained me and because of them I dress better lol. I also think they lost their father tragically and he loved filming them and through so cosmos they are living their live with a piece of him through filming the show making the best home movies ever. My sister hates them but in my opinion her dislike is not justified and is filled with jealousy,0,0

YaTxVflKDQw,just a random comment but dont you think that the host kinda sounds like Claire from modern family,0,0
YaTxVflKDQw,What in the world will these sisters do when Kris kicks the bucket?  Their empire will crash or just will never be the same.  The sisters can't handle much on their own apparently.,0,0
YaTxVflKDQw,Its money that has held these famewhores together not love... stop kidding yourselves Kartrashians. Kendall is the only one who  has turned her tv fame into a legitimate career. The rest can take a one way cruise to the Bermuda triangle.,0,0
YaTxVflKDQw,This is not a legacy to be proud of this was the start of the famous for F**k all era everything they have all the golden opportunities they get and for what? They share the red carpet with real life legends that's crazy to me,0,0
YaTxVflKDQw,Kylie had her lips done. Then she released a lip line. She's a fraud. She fell a victim of her own insecurities and what do you mean how can you not be proud of a business like that? SHE WASNT BORN BROKE. She has always had money! Millions at least! A billion dollars of makeup is ridiculous. Nobody average can just release a lipstick line and make a billion dollars! It's because her family is rich!!!!!! They always have been,0,0
YaTxVflKDQw,I was 2 years old when they started hah,0,0
YaTxVflKDQw,"i guess its the season of trashes hence they lasting this decade.  Kylie and Kim and all steal others ideas and even their make up, plenty receive empty products!  and WTH is Khloe talking about...she did so many surgeries to look like one of them.",0,0
YaTxVflKDQw,i really dont understand the hate they get.,0,0
YaTxVflKDQw,I like the kardashians they came along way and I think Kim is super pretty I will say this tho yes Kylie made a billion dollar company at 19 but also we need to remember that they were famous before her company and she already had 90 million followers no regular 19 year old at 19 would have been able to do that in such a quick amount of time that's if your not a huge famous celebrity but still Kylie is doing her thing and she's successful at it I love all of them there defenitly hard workers,0,0
YaTxVflKDQw,Now the real question is Who are they and why are they famous? I think they all forgot that their fathers/husbands (Bruce Jenner and Robert Kardashian - OJ Trial) are the only reasons this family pushed their own way into the limelight. It's sickening. Talentless bimbos these women.,0,0
YaTxVflKDQw,Bs this show is for the born rich an famous people smh they never was at the bottom an worked up it was handed to them Not saying it's their fault it's a lot of people born into rich families but some don't have to be in the public eye because they have enough to just relax on whereas some rich people wanna be More rich than they already are,0,0
YaTxVflKDQw,To become as rich as the Kardashians you need money to start off with. Obviously if a normal person tries to do that it would take them longer and you would be in debt your whole life's. These are not goals at all.,0,0
YaTxVflKDQw,I really like this family,0,0

F8i8pnZmk50,"If you only look at the specs without knowing that it's an Apple iPhone 8, you would think it's a budget phone. For example the Moto E4 US$129 iPhone 8 US$699. \\nDisplay 720p V 750p. Battery 2,800mAh V 1821mAh. Both have IP67 rating and 2GB RAM, Moto E4 has a larger display, and of course the Moto E4 has a 3.5mm head jack. \\nThe most impressive iPhone 8 statistic is that it costs more than 5 times the Moto E4!!!!!!!",0,0

Some folks complain about no real singing or R&B is being done and you want it back. But as soon as a vocalist gives you exactly that, you're still not satisfied with it. I don't understand, this is simply the piano and Tamar's voice. What is so bad about that? Y'all never heard of unplugged before? Do you need a club banger or a slick, glossy, over-produced beat to get your attention all the time? Is it because she isn't talking about the club, sex, alcohol, or drugs? Is it because you can't dance to it? Is it because you're so emotionally desensitized you can't relate? I don't get the problem.

How Do You Feel? is my favorite song--not only of LLL--but altogether of yours and I think the red theme in the background and on all of the instruments was the perfect way to symbolize the message of the song; there's blood running through your veins and how do you feel? Do you feel passion for life, what shakes your world and breaks your heart? It's a great reminder to really live life instead of just be alive. Thanks for the inspiration and the great video! I would DIE to see you all perform LLL & AC in full in Baltimore! ❤️❤️❤️",0,0

YaTxVflKDQw,"I have seen their show in the past but do not go out of my way to watch it.  I have seen interviews and found Khloe is the funniest, Kim is well spoken, Kourtney handles herself best in disagreements and Kris created this empire by her drive.  They do not sing or act but neither does Steve Jobs or Bill Gates and people do not say they are untalented hacks. They are successful bc they have a successful brand that they capitalized on. The business empire that is known as Kylie is another branch of the brand. It doesn't matter if they are Jenners because the K brand is how they got popular.  I would not let my teen daughter watch this show because The sleeping around. The show does show all sides and that is one side where I think it crosses a moral line.

They do not sing or act but neither does Steve Jobs or Bill Gates and people do not say they are untalented hacks. They are successful bc they have a successful brand that they capitalized on. The business empire that is known as Kylie is another branch of the brand. It doesn't matter if they are Jenners because the K brand is how they got popular.  I would not let my teen daughter watch this show because The sleeping around. The show does show all sides and that is one side where I think it crosses a moral line.

kaMKInkV7Vs,"Video should have clarified difference between envy-free (I don't think anyone got more than me) and proportionally fair solution (I think I got at least 1/n of the cake). Because later can be achieved with way simpler algorithms in way fewer cuts. For n = 3, e.g. Alice cuts in half, Bob picks bigger half. Then both cut their piece into 3 parts. Charlie picks biggest from both Alice and Bob. Each participant can't believe they got less than 1/3, even if they think someone else got an unfair cut. For most practical applications, including actually cutting the cake, that's more than sufficient. But yeah, there are cases where true envy-free solution is desired.",0,0

qznElIkZ1hc,"She was actually 28 at the time... This was posted by her on Reddit the other day:\\n\\nThat time I was lying next to my sleeping husband browsing Reddit in the dark and discovered myself the subject matter of this post...\\nSo yeah, that’s me in the video. I’ve never actually commented on anything on Reddit before, mostly just a lurker, but I figure this is probably a good time to make my first!\\nI was 28 at the time, living in Queens. It was 2 days before Christmas and my parents were in town visiting. I really did only have 4 hours notice and we all took a ride across the Triboro bridge in rush hour traffic to get me into the makeup chair in time. My parents actually got to see the performance, which was my MET debut, and is still is really special to me. Also, the reactions of the people in the chorus behind me, as I was told by several of them personally afterwards backstage, were actually genuine. It was a terrifying and thrilling night!\\nBtw, I am 36 now. Is that really LATE 30’s??? I would say it still qualifies as mid 30’s and I’m sticking to that.\\nAnyways, this being my first Reddit comment, I’m not really sure if you need proof it’s me, but I’m happy to answer any questions. I will probably fall asleep soon though, you know, being in my late 30’s and all ;)\\nEdit: Proof: https://twitter.com/rachelegilmore/status/912165099368042496\\nThat’s the best I could do for midnight. (Don’t want to wake the sleeping hubby, he flew in from the west coast today). Here I am holding the insert to the original program from that night announcing my performance.\\nEdit 2: Thank you so much for all your wonderful comments. It’s so uplifting to hear that this performance still brings positivity to people after all these years. Off to bed. I will get to work on my inbox tomorrow AM and answer as many of your questions as possible. Goodnight Reddit!\\nEdit 3: Back this morning to answer more questions. Going to try to get to as many as I can. Didn't get too much sleep last night ;)\\nEdit 4: Further proof for those who were asking: https://twitter.com/RacheleGilmore/status/912376104727572480",1,0

65fZOBR0pmM,"Ha ha I felt I single handedly PRAYED for Toni to come back and make music.  You are my current favorite singer and have been for at least 5 years.   BUT, I can't support anymore your worldly ways.  The tits, and ass, the grinding, the sexuality, barely dressed performances.  It is classless!, not godly, provokes lust, embarrasses and dampens your witness.  Your life/walk looks like the world.  Yes we know you love the Word and you love Jesus! But the fruit Tamar!?  The fruit. So disappointed that you have bought into the sexualized, drinking, holding anger way of life.  If you put clothes on, pretended you were blind, and sang for you and God and not for your peers, you would find more peace. I remember when Vince would hold the line and say - that's inappropriate.  But somewhere along the way he backed down, and you started bumping and grinding.  You  have one of the voices of a lifetime!!!! You were given a gift to bring Glory to God but you use it OFTEN to glorify the flesh.  It hurts me because I love Jesus and I love your voice.",0,2
H1YGg8nYkv0,I have incurable cancer and a service dog.  I am glad she was removed.  Her behavior would have made me very very very sick on that plane.

When I was working as a stylist, I remember this absolutely irate mom who practically drug her 2 kids into the salon.   The daughter had thought she could bleach her hair and her younger brothers hair also.  Sadly it cost the mom about $300.00to fix the mess her daughter had made.   I’ve also tried to inform the public that bleaching hair is not as easy as it may look.   \\nVelinaTheFlutterby@gmail.com",0,0

She says she's never seen anyone with tight curls like that [natural hair is not common where we live at all; lots of peer pressure to have relaxed or braided styles, and wigs] -- I said, Mom, you know who Solange Knowles is, you saw her on SNL and she said, Who? :-/ \\nI'm always jealous of any curls, since I have 1a hair -- probably why my husband has 3b-3c curls, lbvs. I've a cousin with 3c hair and when we were kids we always used to joke that we wanted to trade hair, lol. I tried to get a 3b perm two different times when I was little, and my hair is so straight it only turned out to be 2b until I washed it the first time, then it was 2a for a few months, lol. I mean, it's so straight that when I donate my hair and get it shaved off [which I do every five years], it takes four months until my bangs don't stick straight out from my head, sorta 'There's Something About Mary'-ish. -_- Trying to give myself curls with heat styling doesn't work at all -- especially if I try to use product, because that just weighs my hair down more -- I have to do rag curls overnight [starting from wet, almost-squeaky-clean hair] just to get 2c curls *for four hours*. //sigh//",1,0

kaMKInkV7Vs,"That scenario playing out the way that was detailed relies on the person cutting the cake first not making a right mess of it and/or not being able to see they've made a mess of it. If you realised that you'd cut two big pieces and one smaller piece, you'd be a bit miffed if you got that smaller piece and a sliver of that final piece that is cut into three, which would not make up for your main slice.",0,0
kaMKInkV7Vs,"About 25 years ago, at lunch with colleagues, we used the following approach for cheese:\\n- Always cut 1 more piece than the number of people (n people = n+1 pieces), in as similar sizes you can.\\n- Each person picks the piece they prefer.\\n- The remaining piece is then cut by another person in n+1 pieces.\\n- Each person picks the piece they prefer, shifting the previous order by 1 person\\nThis procedure repeats until nobody cares for the remaining particles of cheese.\\nQuite honestly, our method seems easier than the method described in your video above and is equally fair.",0,0

kaMKInkV7Vs,"How about this: cos(60 degrees) = 0.5. Therefore, draw a diameter line on the cake. Divide the diameter in half, label the halfway point as the origin. Then, draw a point halfway between the origin and the edge. Draw a line perpendicular from that point to the upper and lower edge of the cake to make two new points, A and B. Then mark a 3rd point C, on the intersection of the cake edge and the diameter line furthest from A and B. Points A, B, and C are, for any pair, 120 degrees apart. Cake shared.",0,0
kaMKInkV7Vs,"How does this compare with the N person method presented by Marilyn vos Savant (and possibly others, but that's the source I know) in which one person cuts an initial incision into the cake and then sweeps the knife along until anyone, including the person with the knife, sees a size they are happy with can call it out and ask for the cut to happen?\\n\\nSince no one is prohibited from speaking, when a size that is reached for a given person is reached, they can claim it. It is asserted that the division will be fair because everyone save the last person picked the size of their own slice entirely. The last person will then be left with either a 1/N amount of cake (approximately) or greater as they wanted more than anyone else and thus got the most they could while being fair to the others involved.\\n\\nA variation of this stops when 2 (of the N) people remain and divides the remainder using the common 2 person solution of having one make the final cut and the other chose which slice they want.",0,0
kaMKInkV7Vs,"But this is all a psychological thing? I don't understand why this has much to do with mathematics. It's not equal or fair, just satisfactory for all involved. If you wanted that you can just have everyone eat their random slice of cake inside a box so the others can't see it.

Anne picks the 5th and Cate gets the 6th. \\nAnne and Bob cut as evenly as they could, but Cate picks first, which gives her the best slice - only right, since she's done no cutting. Since Bob was the last to make cuts, Anne gets the 2nd - perhaps not the biggest/best slice, but there are 4 other slices that aren't as desirable. Bob has seen the best two slices go to his friends, but he can now leave the worst two slices for them, and he gets the best two of what's left.

kaMKInkV7Vs,"yeah I'm not so sure I agree with the logical flow when it comes to why in the end how everyone is sure to be  happy and without envy. This algorithm assumes that Alice does not change her mind about her initial judgement after viewing the decisions made by Bob and Charlie. After that inspection she may think she made a mistake and wish she had made a different decision. \\nI do agree, as stated in the video, that the size of the slice is not the only contributing factor to the quality of the slice as judged by a human observer. I would also assert, however, that the sum total quality of all the slices (the quality of the entire cake) is reduced with each slice that is made, because with each slice the appearance, durability, and texture of the cake is reduced due to the introduction of more and more entropy by the cake cutting process. The rate of this increased entropy depends greatly on the materials used to make the cake as well as cake temperature. (no bake cheese cake for example behaves much differently than the cake shown in the video) \\nThe point being, as N number of people increases the more cuts need to be made, the more the entire cake loses quality, which means that each piece while perhaps being more fair, on average will be of a lesser quality then using an unfair system. This algorithm is simply trading quality for fairness. If a large amount of people across the globe decide to use such a system, the sum total quality of all cakes in the world would decrease. Thus the efficiency of cakes' ability to make people happy is reduced. Not only that, but if one country decides to use such a system and neighboring countries do not, the net loss in happiness in the country that uses this system will breed envy on an international level. Wars have been started over less. Let them eat cake indeed. \\n\\nAlso to really be fair, this algorithm needs to be recursive on that little left-over piece until everyone agrees that the last remaining leftover piece is too small to be significant and is thrown over their shoulder to the dogs.",0,0

My system doesn't depend on either of you getting any priority treatment, that first slice is not for me therefore for BOTH of you. You can divide that like a regular cake, one cuts the other chooses\\n\\nBen nice try, what if you cut a tiny slice? That'll screw everything up\\n\\nAdam that is the offer I am making, I cut a one-third slice and if you don't want it then let me have it, either because I screwed up and cut myself too little or I was truly fair and cut myself only my fair share.\\n\\nCarl I see, you have every incentive to be fair as if you take too much then Ben and I both EQUALLY benefit as we split it.\\n\\nBen yeah, if we both get a bit more than 1 sixth each then there'll be a bit less than 2 thirds remaining\\n\\nAdam and that remaining two thirds I split between me and you by 'one cuts the other chooses' if I make one piece bigger then you'll take the bigger piece. Then that bigger piece you split equally.\\n\\nSeems fair to me, if the cutter tries to cheat, then whatever remains equally benefits the other 2 by one cuts the other chooses.\\n\\nThis assumes there is no subjectivity, that everyone knows what is a fair piece and there's no chance Ben will say the first slice is too big yet Carl say the first slice is too small.",0,0

H1YGg8nYkv0,How did she get that far without the right paperwork?,0,0
H1YGg8nYkv0,"I was on a Southwest flight from Denver to San Jose this past Thursday night.  Despite being told that it was a fully booked flight, with no spare seating, a woman sitting in the row ahead of me placed a sign in her two adjoining seats that read:  Suffering from nerve damage - no electronics allowed (this includes cell phones, computers, laptops, iPads, etc).  Newspapers, magazines, and books are welcome.  Everyone kept passing by her seat row.  An attendant, being made aware of the situation by another passenger, approached the woman (who by now had donned a surgical face mask and gloves) and informed her that she - the passenger - could not deny any of these two seats to another passenger, nor could she place restrictions upon them.  Plane filled, 2 people sat next to her and they ACTUALLY HONORED her request.  I respect these strangers for acquiescing to her demands (everyone just wanted to get home and not have an incident like this video), but I fear that it has emboldened her behavior for future flights.  BTW - everyone in front and behind her was using some sort of electronic device before takeoff, after landing, and a few were using devices in flight.  Her 'issue' was unspecified, as 'nerve damage' is a broad diagnosis....perhaps screen brightness, flashing/moving images cause seizures or migraines.  Perhaps she should purchase all 3 seats for future flights?",0,0

If person 3 chooses the first set of slices then they could make three slices with frosting and cake in every slice without regard to other people's preference.

A fourth, fifth, then sixth circle who's centerpoint is always on the intersection of the edges of the first circle drawn and the last circle drawn.  Eventually you will get 6 equal points, from which you can easily find a triangle.  If you just cut from each point to the center of the circle you'd have 3 equal slices.",0,0

uE_hF1R20rg,"I would follow this man into a dark alley carrying my own drop cloth.  I admire how plainly he speaks and how well he expresses himself.  Truly a man of class, which unfortunately, seems to be a rarity these days.  Kudos to You, Jared",2,0

H1YGg8nYkv0,"I was on a Southwest flight from Denver to San Jose this past Thursday night.  Despite being told that it was a fully booked flight, with no spare seating, a woman sitting in the row ahead of me placed a sign in her two adjoining seats that read:  Suffering from nerve damage - no electronics allowed (this includes cell phones, computers, laptops, iPads, etc).  Newspapers, magazines, and books are welcome.  Everyone kept passing by her seat row.  An attendant, being made aware of the situation by another passenger, approached the woman (who by now had donned a surgical face mask and gloves) and informed her that she - the passenger - could not deny any of these two seats to another passenger, nor could she place restrictions upon them.  Plane filled, 2 people sat next to her and they ACTUALLY HONORED her request.  I respect these strangers for acquiescing to her demands (everyone just wanted to get home and not have an incident like this video), but I fear that it has emboldened her behavior for future flights.  BTW - everyone in front and behind her was using some sort of electronic device before takeoff, after landing, and a few were using devices in flight.  Her 'issue' was unspecified, as 'nerve damage' is a broad diagnosis....perhaps screen brightness, flashing/moving images cause seizures or migraines.  Perhaps she should purchase all 3 seats for future flights?",0,0

xnSew-tCuPo,"Hi My work shop is close to 25 years old, similar size and was built with my father in law ( great fun ) and as of last year has a solar panel system 450W and slightly bigger deep cycle gel battery storage running a 240volt fridge thru a 3000W inverter approximately 400 litre fridge/freeze continuously with a timer off switch for night time isolation. It can also run band saws table saw and other mains power tools but Max's out at 6000w when drawn for 8+ seconds I.e. major motor startups otherwise surprising similar and I still have back up mains power with PV mains inverter feed system from the house anyway. \\nNo major issues with power supply and none of this weekend warrior crap, it just takes a little time effort and research.

If you werent being careful you could walk there, run through the cable and knock over the bandsaw (maybe breaking it).

zHdJwBrT3WA,"My one point of contention with your reasoning on this MatPat is that you assume the black hole has to be stable. More than likely the black holes it would use as attacks are meant to strike quickly, (most likely within a fraction of a second, since while they're turn based in game, Pokemon battles are generally shown to be relatively fast paced in the show), before dissipating. This would allow it to attack and deal severe damage to its opponent, without going to the incredibly ridiculous lengths necessary to create a stable black hole. Not saying your information about black holes or your research is incorrect, but rather that you're not considering the practical application of how it would attack with said black holes. Still a good episode over all, and I'm looking forward to more as there are a lot of entries that make little sense, but I did have to point out my personal disagreement with your over all conclusion on this one......",0,0

zHdJwBrT3WA,"1:23 ...the Pokedex, this pocket encyclopedia... I'm gonna' have to stop you there, MatPat. It's not an encyclopedia at all! If it were, it would be called the Pokepedia! Instead, it's a PokeDEX. Why? Because it's a Pokemon index! Indexes are informal collections of information designed to give a general knowledge of a given subject. Thing is? An index isn't held up to anywhere near as high a standard as an encyclopedia. If the author of the index chooses to do proper research and find the real truth about things, all the better, but it is nowhere near required. Which is why some 'dex entries for Exeggcute claim it to be a cluster of eggs, while others say it is merely MISTAKEN for eggs frequently, when the truth is they're more like seeds. Mistakes like the former are acceptable in an index.",0,0

zHdJwBrT3WA,"The concept of black hole radiation contradicts the concept of black holes themselves. Enough gravity that light cannot escape. No mass can escape that gravitational pull, therefore radiation from a black hole is absolutely impossible. It's a logical impossibility for both of those concepts to be true.",0,0
zHdJwBrT3WA,"something my friend explained to me, all of the entries in the poke'dex could just be nothing more than folklore, not an actuality. in the universe of pokemon, the pokemon themselves have been around a lot longer than the dex and considering these creatures are magical, there's a good chance the characters would have stories and legends about the them. sure the professors were the ones to have made the dex, however they themselves never once say they saw these creatures doing some of these really creepy things, and if they did, they're monsters especially in the case of Driftloon",0,0

zHdJwBrT3WA,"Victini's infinite energy that its Pokédex entries reference cannot actually be infinite. How can you actually fit an infinite energy source into a body with finite volume, let alone one about the size (and indeed, mass) of a Pikachu? Even taking into account the famous Einstein equation E = m*c^2, you would get a whole bunch of potential energy, so certainly enough to make the Tepig's attack overkill even against a Pokémon against which it has a type disadvantage (which I at least think is Samurott), but it's still a finite figure.",0,0

xnSew-tCuPo,"Nice little project - wouldn't it be more efficient to run the tool chargers and lighting directly off of the DC power, before the inverter?

xnSew-tCuPo,Very nice and considerate design,0,0
xnSew-tCuPo,how much u paid to let them build the whole garage ?\nthe panel is water proof ?\nwhat happen if it rain or snow it get wet?\ndoesn't work anymore?\ni love the shelfs of the garage u can put things in don't wasted any space ..\ngarage should be big enough for a car to go inside?\nsuv or a normal car\ni think the garage should be a little more bigger wilder \nfor me that a small garage \nmaybe add a ceiling fan on top of the garage for those\nhot summer day's?,0,0
xnSew-tCuPo,A nice clean build. Your choice of inefficient lighting seemed odd. I forgot how groovy it is to design without budget constraints. Did a whole 1-1/2 car garage like this with old crappy shelving and plywood wall panels. A coating of epoxy paint on the floor and 5 gallons of white acrylic paint sprayed on everything... Looked like a million bucks when finished.,0,0

xnSew-tCuPo,Is this a home depot commercial?,1,3
xnSew-tCuPo,"And that my friends, that's how you build a grow house (;",4,2
xnSew-tCuPo,"Minor nitpick:  Sure your inverter will handle the drill press and band saw together with no load, but that's not how you use them.  Try it again, but lean on that drill press with a piece of mild steel under it, and have your buddy cut something with the band saw simultaneously.  I'm not looking up part numbers and specs, but I'll bet the two tools spinning with no load is less than 500 watts.  Most cigarette lighter inverters can do that for a few seconds.",0,2
xnSew-tCuPo,"Shouldnt you ahve used DC chargers for the tools, that way your not converting from DC to AC to DC and wasting more electric then needed?",0,2
xnSew-tCuPo,How about a 6 x 12 off grid hunting cabin?,1,1
xnSew-tCuPo,"Maybe the next project could be a system in a shed big enough to power a house off grid completely.  It should have individual circuit shut down as the power drains, leaving power only for critical use devices  (fridge, furnace,...).\\n\\nMaybe add HHO and vertical axis windmill?  Maybe you have a different idea where the power for this should all be stored.  I think a shed or barn would be better than a house.",1,1
xnSew-tCuPo,I was wondering how much power the solar panels produce if it was enough to run an air conditioner? As I live in the south this is a must also should I add more panels or batteries?,0,2

xnSew-tCuPo,How do you know what type of solar panel and equipment to get?,1,1
xnSew-tCuPo,You guy forgot the eyewash station and fire extinguisher!,1,1
xnSew-tCuPo,"Why are you transforming DC into AC and back into DC again?\\nYou could just modify the chargers so they run off DC and have a way more efficient system!\\n\\nSame with lighting, no need to use AC for that.\\n\\nEverything except motorised tools could be run off DC perfectly fine and way more efficient.",0,6

H1YGg8nYkv0,"I was on a Southwest flight from Denver to San Jose this past Thursday night.  Despite being told that it was a fully booked flight, with no spare seating, a woman sitting in the row ahead of me placed a sign in her two adjoining seats that read:  Suffering from nerve damage - no electronics allowed (this includes cell phones, computers, laptops, iPads, etc).  Newspapers, magazines, and books are welcome.  Everyone kept passing by her seat row.  An attendant, being made aware of the situation by another passenger, approached the woman (who by now had donned a surgical face mask and gloves) and informed her that she - the passenger - could not deny any of these two seats to another passenger, nor could she place restrictions upon them.  Plane filled, 2 people sat next to her and they ACTUALLY HONORED her request.  I respect these strangers for acquiescing to her demands (everyone just wanted to get home and not have an incident like this video), but I fear that it has emboldened her behavior for future flights.  BTW - everyone in front and behind her was using some sort of electronic device before takeoff, after landing, and a few were using devices in flight.  Her 'issue' was unspecified, as 'nerve damage' is a broad diagnosis....perhaps screen brightness, flashing/moving images cause seizures or migraines.  Perhaps she should purchase all 3 seats for future flights?",0,0

eImtYyuQCZ8,"The nature of the soil can often be determined by its electrical conductivity.  Crays are very conductive but clean sand isn't.  It is fairly common for there to be an old stream bed buried deep into the ground.  It works as a path for water to move more easily so the path from above the dam to below the dam can effectively be shorter going down into the old stream, along it and then back up below the dam.  This is why it is important to know what is below the dam down to a fair depth.",0,0

Could this be a possible problem in the future with increasing rain events coupled with the intensities of the storms we get?

They don't belong on your plate, they belong in the oceans. Please, please help keep them there, supply and demand.

zHdJwBrT3WA,Black holes ARE NOT invisible. For something to be invisible light must freely pass through it. You would see a blackhole. When you walk into a pitch black room you don't call everything in the dark room invisible.... you call it dark.... like you can't see anything because your eyes are unable to spot light.... Seeing a blackhole would be the same. Not to mention the light bending around the blackhole would be insanely bright. Quasars and blazars are some of the brightest things in our universe.,0,0

In the Pokemon games, the pokedex entry that you gain after catching a new pokemon is so inaccurate, it could only be written by a certain 10 year old. I believe that the entries are written by the player on the spot without any prior research. This explains the stupid descriptions like Charmander's tail and the terrible measurements.

zHdJwBrT3WA,"But you ignored the whole it uses psychic energy to create the black hole it, out right stated the creation technique which can be interpreted to mean that it uses its psychic energy to condense the mass but it could also mean that it creates one out of pure psychic energy which would be a completely different entity then a black hole but may be explained best by using a black hole as an example. Also I think it should be acknowledged that true psychic abilities are not necessarily covered by science so its hard to say what rules of the physical world it obeys and follows gardevoir may create a true black hole of mass but through psychic energy be able to ignore its gravity and manipulate how the force acts on its environment like how we are able to direct a vacuum cleaner it may be a tool she can use.\\n\\nJust curious about your thoughts on this?

zHdJwBrT3WA,"Yes but assuming Gardevoir's telekinetic powers are formidable enough, wouldn't it be possible for it to create a black hole within its opponent?

zHdJwBrT3WA,I think a better much more accepted theory about the pokedex's inaccuracy is that it's written by 10 year olds.

Catalan separatism is anti-Spanish and communist in origin, Catalan region is long infested with marxists. Why does the Western media outside Spain always fail to mention these details, just because the leftists hide behind red and yellow flags?",3,3
eHV5gHeVgH0,"Spain has been a great friend of the United States, as both a  NATO member and a trade partner. It is a major net  contributor to the rule based global order — more than 2000  Spanish troops are involved with numerous UN missions around  the world — and spends around $1.5 billion on foreign  assistance annually. Spain also has shared interests in  improving democracy in Venezuela, largely supports the goals  of a full democracy in Cuba, and has been involved on the  security side of things in the Sahel. The current Spanish  national government has expressed support for the  Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), a  U.S.-European free trade agreement. In short, Spain is a  reliable partner of the United States. A unified Spain is a  stronger global partner than a divided one.",5,2

This constitution is based on the indissoluble unity of the Spanish nation. Its ratification in 1978 was the result of a broad consensus across diverse parties, including the Catalan nationalists of Puigdemont’s party, and received support from over 90 percent of the Catalan voters in a referendum.",4,1

H1YGg8nYkv0,"This is an excellent example of how using a bs excuse- to impose personal preference on other people- can backfire. Many comments are about the ‘allergic’ woman having a cultural allergy. Granted, it is a well known and common cultural ‘norm’ within Islamic and other Asian societies to behave/react/treat animals in a manner that is vastly different from the cultural ‘norms’ in America. Especially, where dogs are concerned. Many Americans accept/love/treat dogs as family members and revere their service abilities. Socially/culturally, the U.S. has enacted laws surrounding service animals. Keeping in mind ‘norms’ aren’t necessarily followed by everyone in/of their culture.... this woman’s actions and behaviors substantially reflect her agreement with cultural bias more so than concern for a physiological allergic reaction. A human being that has a physiological allergic reaction to dogs would- 1) make necessary arrangements while booking the flight, and 2) would immediately remove themselves from an environment where potential of an allergic reaction that could easily lead to death was highly probable. Further, they would do so without force and without attempting to justify their perspective relative to personal academic accomplishments/occupation.",0,0

It is fairly common for there to be an old stream bed buried deep into the ground.  It works as a path for water to move more easily so the path from above the dam to below the dam can effectively be shorter going down into the old stream, along it and then back up below the dam.

Its sad that judaic hollywood is trying to fabricate good in his evil. But the victors write the history books. And Churchill has written his lies as the truths. Heil Hitler",0,7

zHdJwBrT3WA,Maybe they meant to say that it can manipulate gravity around it rather than creating a black hole. It would make more sense that way since there are pokemon and moves that deal with manipulating gravitational pull on themselves and their opponents,0,0

zHdJwBrT3WA,"Yeah okay, the black hole thing is incredibly silly, but the amount of Rule 34 on that thing is absurd!!\\n(Semi-)Joking aside, I'll never understand pokemon titles. Like Gardevoir being the Embrace pokemon when [a] no dex entry ever really explains that, and [b] it has that spiky-heart-crystal-doodad on its chest. I always assumed it would have to be soft, like fleshy, otherwise... well the internet is full of embrace jokes.\\nAnother one that leaps to mind is Arcanine being the Legendary pokemon.

zHdJwBrT3WA,"But what if a cubic metre of air (mass ~1.3kg) was condensed into a black hole in the centre of an attack. It would have a lifetime of 1.8*10^-16 seconds, but could surely disrupt the attack velocity, energy, etc. If not, the movement of air would also affect the attack, disrupting it in some way. If it compressed 10 cubic metres of air, the black hole would have a lifetime of 1.8*1^-13 s and even more mass to disrupt the attack. This also isn't considering the heat that would be generated by compressing so much mass so quickly. My point in this argument is that the black hole does not need to be stable to affect the environment and if the description was accurate it would be beneficial not to have a stable black hole as that would destroy the earth as stated. Also there is plenty of mass lying around that could be used, and wouldn't be noticed missing. Although it takes tremendous energy to compress matter past its neutron degeneracy pressure, is there an accurate or reliable scale or description of what psychic powers are? Idk, I thought of this argument and found a calculator online.",0,0

zHdJwBrT3WA,I can't stand these black hole analogies.

There is no black hole size where this would be the case. \nSo yeah Matt you did it. You called BS on pokemon physics. Good job,0,0

Telekinesis is one of those abilities that is more powerful the better the user understands what they're doing. The Gardevoir knows what it's doing. It's pulling matter from all around it into the black hole, thus sustaining it artificially in a way that natural black holes simply cannot do themselves.\\nYour science is right, but your understanding of the game is lacking in this case.

zHdJwBrT3WA,wouldnt it still be considered a small blackhole if they compressed the thing that was trying to hurt their trainer? and the attacker would be radiation that would probably stop being radiated and become part of earth again.... and it does say to protect them meaning they might only use this as a last hope type thing as creating blackholes and bypassing the effects of gravity (it does say they dont feel gravity but doesnt mean it wont affect them) they would probably be able to detect human emotion.... and hopefully the emotion of the things that it might need to destroy so it feels bad but....,0,0
zHdJwBrT3WA,you don't even need to go that far to prove it wrong: creating a black hole large enough to fit a human would fail at protecting it since said trainer would just get crushed by the presure,0,0

zHdJwBrT3WA,"Black holes aren't invisible. That's not what invisible means. Or black.\\n\\nA black hole absorbs all light that crosses it's event horizon. Leaving aside that they arr frequently surrounded by orbiting matter, a more critical point is... They block light!\\nThus, if a black hole were to pass in front of something, you would be unable to see through the black hole to the objects behind it.\\nThis makes it... Black.\\nBlack being the abbsence of colour, or in theory, the absense of visible light.\\nPaint cannot ever truly absorb ALL light, but note that the whole point of an object being black as opposed to grey or white is  that it neithrr reflects nor emits large amounts of light. Thus, the less light an object is capable of emitting or reflecting, the closer it is to being truly 'black'.\\nFor an object to be invisible however, it has to not be detectable.\\nBut a black object held in front of a bright, coloured background is very visible indeed.\\nWhat is NOT so visible, is a transparent object, such as glass.\\nThus an invisible object would not be one that absorbs or reflects light, but one which transmits it without ever absorbing or distorting any of it.\\nNone of which describes a black hole.\\nThus, a black hole is indeed black, and not invisible. What renders black holes invisible is trying to look at one against a background with little to no contrast.",0,0

Or rather we perceive it as black because everything around it is  bouncing off light and in contrast to that it makes the hole actually look black?

What do you expect?,  that the government is not going to do anything when the integrity of the Nation is at stake? Hahaha, good one. And ignorant people call this oppression.

Do you know the separatists HARASSED the policia nacional and guardia civil during the days before the referendum? They had to stay on ships because of that.

Wars broke out when Central and Latin America wanted independence! Same goes for the USA. Has Trump forgotten that his countrymen fought against the Colonial powers before USA became idependent? Ex Yugoslovia was ok to break apart into so many countries Why is it that the same does not apply for Catalonia? Couldn't the Spanish government at least disguss offering them more freedom, allowing the referendum to go on and stop acting like dictator Franco? By sending police to opress the people's will they will achieve nothing at all! Whenever we Europeans send in armies it's ok but when other countries do the same they are Dictators!

It is a major net  contributor to the rule based global order — more than 2000  Spanish troops are involved with numerous UN missions around  the world — and spends around $1.5 billion on foreign  assistance annually. Spain also has shared interests in  improving democracy in Venezuela, largely supports the goals  of a full democracy in Cuba, and has been involved on the  security side of things in the Sahel. The current Spanish  national government has expressed support for the  Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), a  U.S.-European free trade agreement. In short, Spain is a  reliable partner of the United States. A unified Spain is a  stronger global partner than a divided one.",5,2

xnSew-tCuPo,"Great job but I would have added insulation, a ceiling and walls.  I also would have vented the roof with ridge and soffit vents.",0,0
xnSew-tCuPo,Some clever ideas but the rain gutter recessed lighting has a couple issues. First being that this is a wood working tool shop there is going to be tons of dust flying up and around and rain gutters in a woodshop are now sawdust gutters that dont drain. You'll slowly lose light as that sawdust builds up and in a few months you wont have any light as it will be burried under a bunch of sawdust getting hot and possibly causing a fire.,0,0

xnSew-tCuPo,"Just a very small nitpick that really does not matter; a inverter circuit boosts an AC voltage to a higher AC voltage, the part that converts DC to AC is often called an oscillator or waveform/sine generator and I believe it is called a faze converter in power grid usage.",0,0

zHdJwBrT3WA,"Bad science. This channel's theory, not the Pokedex. Completely lacks understanding of singularities. First, the minimum size and energy of small black hole are not certain. Secondly, assuming the rate of Hawking radiation is as predicted a 70 metric ton blackhole would be stable for about a year, 20 metric tons about a second. Something the mass of the moon would basically last longer than the current age of the universe. Now a micro-singularity weighing about 20 metric tons would still be lethal if not due to gravity due to the radiation released we are talking 389,740 megatonnes of TNT worth of energy in a second. The radiation would definitely kill you and probably everything on the planet. A black hole with the energy of a kilogram of TNT would have a mass of like 0.05 micrograms and only need to last a fraction of a second and could still harm any threat to its trainer. The question would be how the hell does it shield its trainer from the radiation. Also, black holes aren't invisible more like if you could actually see it it would be black since black is the absence of light. Now due to gravity bending light, it would kind of be like a lens bending light around it but I am too lazy to work out the math right now. The reason we can't directly see black holes in space is not because they are invisible but because the accretion disk is basically generating massive amounts of radiation mostly in the form of x-rays and the blackhole itself doesn't directly emit light and absorbs the light headed toward it so there is no way to see it since the empty space also doesn't directly emit light. basically a black body against a mostly black background would be invisible.  But I imagine like a marble on a tablecloth if space had way more stars and empty space was not black these black holes would not be invisible. Meaning if an entity ever made one on a planet it could be visible and probably larger than expected since while the sigularity would be microscoping the well creating the lensing could be significantly larger.",0,0

Just saying Ash doesnt know what a blackhole is....",0,0
zHdJwBrT3WA,"The issue is that (according to the Pokedex) Gardevoir uses psychokinetic power to distort dimensions in Sapphire, and psychic power in Black/White. So we know that some kind of psychic power is at play, which deals with the realm of nonexistent forces and magic. If that is the case, then the creation and utility of black holes is possible the moment magic is allowed in the context. Magic can be used to justify any questionable claim. How doesn't the world get destroyed when Gardevoir uses makes a black hole? Magic. Why don't pokemon die when they are hit with extremely powerful attacks? Magic. The mention that Gardevoir is not affected by gravity should have already notified you about the involvement of magic. In our understanding of the universe, nothing is unaffected by gravity. Then what is Gardevoir made of? Perhaps magic? \\n\\nAlso, your claim that science is lying to us with the term 'black holes' is misleading at best. Yes, the term may be inaccurate for its description, but it is not a lie to have a misleading term. Black holes are a shorthand way to describe these things in space; it's a name. \\n\\nOh, and the title of the video? FULL OF LIES, you say? You have only made a (questionable) claim about one pokemon's pokedex entry. One out of several hundred pokedex entries is not sufficient to make a FULL OF LIES claim. Perhaps a more accurate clickbait title would be Game Theory: The Pokedex LIES TO US. That title is in line with your claim, which I believe is incorrect anyway. \\n\\nFeel free to discuss and point out any errors in my thinking. I am happy to admit my wrongs. \\n\\nTL;DR: \\nGardevoir uses psychic power, which is essentially magic. Magic can justify anything, including the use of black holes.",0,0

zHdJwBrT3WA,"Next time you talk about black holes can you slip in the word Spaghettification ?\\nNot sure if I spelled it right but it's supposed to be a homogeneous gravitational field caused by extreme tidal forces, in the most extreme cases, near black holes,the stretching is so powerful that no object can withstand it, no matter how strong its components. Within a small region the horizontal compression balances the vertical stretching so that small objects being spaghettified experience no net change in volume.\\nWell it says so in Wikipedia.",0,0

I assume it's the same as ours but they use Pokeballs that can contain things muuuuuch larger than the ball itself, which can compress... What's to stop the gardevoire from keeping the Black hole contained? and wouldn't a Shadow ball look like a Black Hole? It certainly looks like a void. Everyone knows what a shadow ball looks like but the question becomes, what happens if it's altered slightly. If your creating it with mental powers then you can limit the mass going into it and also pull things into it.

God offered His Son as a personal sacrifice for us, because He loves us so much. Every one is a sinner. No one is good enough to get into Heaven. But through  the Blood of Jesus Christ, He has made a way, the only WAY as Christ said. \\n\\nJohn 14:6 Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by Me.\\n\\nThe gift of salvation is free: Believe in Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior. \\n\\nRomans 10:9 That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\\n\\nAs of today, this will be a time of decision and you will never be the same today, even if you refuse Christ you'll never be the same once you've faced Him, once you've heard the gospel and rejected it you can never be the same. The Bible says when the rich young ruler rejected Christ, he turned away, grieved emotionally disturbed, because when you reject the claims of Christ that's a very serious thing. This is the most important moment of decision making, for today your life will never be the same. If you reject Christ, you will be cast into HELL and there shall you be for ALL ETERNITY! I am not judging, I am warning everyone...\\n\\nI pray you will call upon the Lord Jesus Christ. Repent, ask Him to forgive you of your sins. Allow the Holy Ghost to enter your heart and transform you in an awesome way... Believe in Jesus Christ as your personal Lord and Savior.",0,0

A lot of the time its to find the original sounds that were modified to fit an EDM type track, or what a sound from an NES/SNES/N64 is supposed to be mimicking. I mean this is the only logical reason why someone who doesn't know a lot about music would be good at recognising an instrument.

Uiccgh2GXzs,"Grrrrrr! What better place to vent than under a car vid? Took my truck in to get my belts tightened and when they were bringing my truck back out to me the brake line went. So a 70 dollar trip turned into a 400 dollar trip. Oddly I originally had an appt for the belts for Tuesday but last week I had the urge to get in sooner, so they got me in today. I always get feelings like that. I am known for them.  So this would have likely happened while I was driving over the weekend. \\n\\n On the plus side they gave me a 2018 Chevy Equinox as a loaner until next week. Plenty of rust under my truck also. I really wish the previous owners(My dad and his wife) were more proactive and had it undercoated. I live in the rust belt of Canada, probably the world. Snow, ice, salt, etc. The truck is 13 years old. Time to start saving I guess for a new vehicle. Sorry about the rant but I know your viewers could relate and I enjoy typing. Heh.

I figured out it was just a string type of acoustic guitar, other than that the test was fairly easy. \\nI don't mean to brag or anything, I am actually confused myself, maybe its because I like to do this sort of thing a lot. A lot of the time its to find the original sounds that were modified to fit an EDM type track, or what a sound from an NES/SNES/N64 is supposed to be mimicking. I mean this is the only logical reason why someone who doesn't know a lot about music would be good at recognising an instrument.

The total cost of the PS4 Pro plus these accessories turns out to be about $1020USD if you really want performance gains that badly then sink that into a gaming PC and you will see a better cost to performance ratio.

XLNLPIRS62g,"Look, I was a fan of Milo for the longest time, but this video is very concerning and I think peoples loyalties are blinding them of caution. \\n\\nFirst of all, is Richard Spencer in this? It appears so, and if so; if he hates Milo so much, why is he there at a bar partying with him?\\n\\nSecond: is anyone else going to question Milo's voice? It almost doesn't even sound like him. You can't speak in such a high pitch and manage the bass of a grown man over night. I've always wondered if Milo's stage voice was his genuine voice; like does he talk like that in private?. This video may prove otherwise.\\n\\nThree: Milo came out and used some eye condition to clear him of any wrong doing. But seriously, even if he didn't see these Nazi's. There were several around the stage. Are we going to act like none of them spoke to Milo before or after this performance? Why would Milo be in the same room as Nazi's if he's so against them?\\n\\nFinally. I'm afraid this may be more than most people are going to want. Especially fans of Milo, but I'm going to play the conspiracy card. I believe we may have all been played. Yes, he married a black guy, but is it possible, the Nazi party; a party that has sworn to take over the US since coming into existence, has went to the extreme of bringing a gay personality into existence to help win over favor for the party? I mean most people don't like the Nazi's but it's almost like Nazi's have dropped their titles for the same movement but with a different title, and they're using something a little more progressive friendly to get it done; aka Milo. \\n\\nSeriously.",0,0

I believe in free speech but words mean a lot, and you don’t need to say racist shit to be for free speech. If someone was to make fun of people who were killed in Las Vegas people would say that’s wrong because you respect those people, but your excuse for doing shit that’s racist is I have a black boyfriend who’s too embarrassed to show himself.

IQisUbBljW0,"(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\\n\\nJesus said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\\n\\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\\nbut Jesus hid himself, \\nand went out of the temple,\\n\\ngoing through the midst of them, \\nand so passed by.\\n\\n(John 8:58-59).\\n\\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\\n\\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\\n\\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(I AM):\\n\\n(Gk. ego emimi);\\n\\n*(John 6:35)<---And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst).\\n*(John 10:7)<---Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep).\\n*(John 10:14)<---I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine).\\n*(John 15:1)<---I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman).\\n*(John 18:5)<---They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\\n\\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\\n\\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\\n\\nThen answered Jesus \\nand said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \\n\\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\\nfor what things soever he doeth, \\n\\nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\\n\\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\\n\\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \\nand sheweth him all things \\nthat himself doeth:\\n\\nand he will shew him \\ngreater works than these, \\nthat ye may marvel.\\n\\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\\n\\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \\nand quickeneth them; \\neven so the Son quickeneth \\nwhom he will.\\n\\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\\n(John 5:19-21).",0,0

It was the summer of 2007, and Andrew had been invited to tour Israel as part of a media junket. I agreed to tag along as his lawyer and best friend. What neither of us knew at the time was that the trip would change our lives and give us the inspiration for Breitbart News Network.\\n\\nOne night in Jerusalem, when we were getting ready for dinner, Andrew turned to me and asked if I would de-partner from the 800-person law firm where I was practicing and become business partners with him. He said he needed my help to create a media company. He needed my help to “change the world.”\\n\\nPerhaps it was because we were in such an historic place, or because I was energized by the courage of the Jewish people in the Holy Land, or maybe it was the alcohol at cocktail hour, but I said “yes.”\\n\\nWe were blown away by the spirit, tenacity, and resourcefulness of the Israeli people on that trip. Andrew could be quite convincing, not to mention inspiring, and I decided right there and then to “throw away” (my Mom’s phrase) a perfectly good, successful and safe career in order to start a “new media” company with Andrew Breitbart out of his basement and my home office.\\n\\nFrom that humble beginning grew Breitbart News Network.\\n\\nOne thing we specifically discussed that night was our desire to start a site that would be unapologetically pro-freedom and pro-Israel. We were sick of the anti-Israel bias of the mainstream media and J-Street. By launching Breitbart Jerusalem, the journey comes full circle and a promise between two friends is fulfilled.

It appears so, and if so; if he hates Milo so much, why is he there at a bar partying with him?\\n\\nSecond: is anyone else going to question Milo's voice? It almost doesn't even sound like him. You can't speak in such a high pitch and manage the bass of a grown man over night. I've always wondered if Milo's stage voice was his genuine voice; like does he talk like that in private?. This video may prove otherwise.\\n\\nThree: Milo came out and used some eye condition to clear him of any wrong doing. But seriously, even if he didn't see these Nazi's. There were several around the stage. Are we going to act like none of them spoke to Milo before or after this performance? Why would Milo be in the same room as Nazi's if he's so against them?\\n\\nFinally. I'm afraid this may be more than most people are going to want. Especially fans of Milo, but I'm going to play the conspiracy card. I believe we may have all been played. Yes, he married a black guy, but is it possible, the Nazi party; a party that has sworn to take over the US since coming into existence, has went to the extreme of bringing a gay personality into existence to help win over favor for the party? I mean most people don't like the Nazi's but it's almost like Nazi's have dropped their titles for the same movement but with a different title, and they're using something a little more progressive friendly to get it done; aka Milo. \\n\\nSeriously.",1,0

Uiccgh2GXzs,"My 2000 toyota corolla does an excellent job when it comes to turns, but my 2011 chevrolet impala sucks! I hate the chevrolet impala, plus I have to spend more on gas. I used to perpendicularly reverse park easily with the corolla, but now I have to turn before I perpendicularly reverse park with the impala. When I was driving the corolla I would wonder why do people turn before they park? I thought It was just because they're lazy (and that may be the case), but now I understand. They can't make sharp turns. Like my corolla could. I will say the Impala is a bit faster but every car has its advantages and disadvantages. I don't like impalas though. I would (and am going) to sell it for another car, a ws6 trans am.",0,0

L9ng story short, take a wire grinder to the back of your rims where they meet your wheel spacers, then have them rebalanced. That oxidation can cause a bad balance, and more importantly, can cause your lugnuts to loosen via vibrations. Alot of tire shops don't do it. We do alot of high value cars, aka bmw's, vette's, benz's, etc. We're the only tire shop for 3 hrs drive that most bring theirs in for us to work on.

IQisUbBljW0,"(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\\n\\nJesus said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\\n\\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\\nbut Jesus hid himself, \\nand went out of the temple,\\n\\ngoing through the midst of them, \\nand so passed by.\\n\\n(John 8:58-59).\\n\\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\\n\\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\\n\\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(I AM):\\n\\n(Gk. ego emimi);\\n\\n*(John 6:35)<---And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst).\\n*(John 10:7)<---Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep).\\n*(John 10:14)<---I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine).\\n*(John 15:1)<---I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman).\\n*(John 18:5)<---They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\\n\\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\\n\\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\\n\\nThen answered Jesus \\nand said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \\n\\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\\nfor what things soever he doeth, \\n\\nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\\n\\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\\n\\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \\nand sheweth him all things \\nthat himself doeth:\\n\\nand he will shew him \\ngreater works than these, \\nthat ye may marvel.\\n\\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\\n\\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \\nand quickeneth them; \\neven so the Son quickeneth \\nwhom he will.\\n\\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\\n(John 5:19-21).",0,0

XLNLPIRS62g,"Layers upon layers of Jewish propaganda!\\nA lot of people don’t realize this but Breitbart News Network really got its start in Jerusalem. It was the summer of 2007, and Andrew had been invited to tour Israel as part of a media junket. I agreed to tag along as his lawyer and best friend. What neither of us knew at the time was that the trip would change our lives and give us the inspiration for Breitbart News Network.\\n\\nOne night in Jerusalem, when we were getting ready for dinner, Andrew turned to me and asked if I would de-partner from the 800-person law firm where I was practicing and become business partners with him. He said he needed my help to create a media company. He needed my help to “change the world.”\\n\\nPerhaps it was because we were in such an historic place, or because I was energized by the courage of the Jewish people in the Holy Land, or maybe it was the alcohol at cocktail hour, but I said “yes.”\\n\\nWe were blown away by the spirit, tenacity, and resourcefulness of the Israeli people on that trip. Andrew could be quite convincing, not to mention inspiring, and I decided right there and then to “throw away” (my Mom’s phrase) a perfectly good, successful and safe career in order to start a “new media” company with Andrew Breitbart out of his basement and my home office.\\n\\nFrom that humble beginning grew Breitbart News Network.\\n\\nOne thing we specifically discussed that night was our desire to start a site that would be unapologetically pro-freedom and pro-Israel. We were sick of the anti-Israel bias of the mainstream media and J-Street. By launching Breitbart Jerusalem, the journey comes full circle and a promise between two friends is fulfilled. And in a very real sense, Breitbart News Network returns to its roots.\\n\\nLarry Solov is President and CEO of Breitbart News Network.",0,0

Just as hypocritical. Further, I am not swayed in the least bit that he is married to the BIG BLACK D***, his male servant. He is a racist and his servant is just to ignorant to know any better.",0,0

XLNLPIRS62g,"Look, I was a fan of Milo for the longest time, but this video is very concerning and I think peoples loyalties are blinding them of caution. \\n\\nFirst of all, is Richard Spencer in this? It appears so, and if so; if he hates Milo so much, why is he there at a bar partying with him?\\n\\nSecond: is anyone else going to question Milo's voice? It almost doesn't even sound like him. You can't speak in such a high pitch and manage the bass of a grown man over night. I've always wondered if Milo's stage voice was his genuine voice; like does he talk like that in private?. This video may prove otherwise.\\n\\nThree: Milo came out and used some eye condition to clear him of any wrong doing. But seriously, even if he didn't see these Nazi's. There were several around the stage. Are we going to act like none of them spoke to Milo before or after this performance? Why would Milo be in the same room as Nazi's if he's so against them?\\n\\nFinally. I'm afraid this may be more than most people are going to want. Especially fans of Milo, but I'm going to play the conspiracy card. I believe we may have all been played. Yes, he married a black guy, but is it possible, the Nazi party; a party that has sworn to take over the US since coming into existence, has went to the extreme of bringing a gay personality into existence to help win over favor for the party? I mean most people don't like the Nazi's but it's almost like Nazi's have dropped their titles for the same movement but with a different title, and they're using something a little more progressive friendly to get it done; aka Milo. \\n\\nSeriously.",1,0

XLNLPIRS62g,"You guys don’t even realize his black boyfriend is so embarrassed he doesn’t even show his face 😫 he doesn’t even show him, my issue is this. What black man would co-sign a Nazi salute, is that supposed to be funny? So you feel your free speech is at such a threat a actual white supremacist is Nazi saluting to your performance. I believe in free speech but words mean a lot, and you don’t need to say racist shit to be for free speech. If someone was to make fun of people who were killed in Las Vegas people would say that’s wrong because you respect those people, but your excuse for doing shit that’s racist is I have a black boyfriend who’s too embarrassed to show himself. We all get free speech doesn’t mean you have to be an asshole because you have no talent.",0,0

If you knew anything about music you would have some respect...but you're too fucking self absorbed and worried about how cool you're going to look in your selfies wearing your new Nikes, listening to Gucci Mane and Instagraming it 2 seconds later. You are the most shallow people looking for the most instant gratification and then move on to something else...that's why music lacks any meaning now, it's all about girls tits hanging out while dancing around some exotic car while some fool talks about how he's the shit and gangsta, and that's the shit you buy..then you go to a GNR video where rock legends with an insane amount of talent are playing and spout off stupid comments cause you think you're clever and somehow entitled to do so. Well guess what, when you actually get out on your own and move out of your parents place you're going to find out that life isn't fucking rap videos, not everything is handed to you, and you're opinions will maybe start to matter then because you're not a self centered entitled loser.

KnE3055j-A0,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

KnE3055j-A0,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",0,0

1wwwXCQyIRA,"Hi hun, thanks for this review, I have ISSUES with finding MUF in my colour and I do like to test the foundation before buying them as you can imagine being the chocolate colour I am I wish people would understand how hard it is to find colours. I have the double wear in Sandlewood colour and still isn't right for me, I have reviewed the Fenty foundation on my channel (I promise this isn't a plug just so you can understand my point of view) \\n\\nThe Estee Lauder sandlewood colour is off on me, and its hard to find shades and then factor in undertone, anyway for the first time in MY life the Fenty foundation is PERFECT for me without having to mix two foundations, and I am not even saying this because it is Rihanna! But I wish people would understand that its not about how many shades, its also the correct undertones.\\n\\nI need companies to bring out a neutral undertone, a yellow one and red one while being the same shade because I could be the same colour as two other girls BUT have different tones.  \\nHope this makes sense Love your channel! xx",3,0
1wwwXCQyIRA,"Gurl who are you kidding?? Your skin is perfect and this is not medium to full coverage, it's no coverage at all, I can still see your redness, it's like you didn't put anything on your skin. The make up is shitty af why don't you say it?? You'll lose your commission??😎",0,0

Tt-a61NG4XY,"So to explain why for Ghost Stories' dub real quick:\\n\\nThe anime was based off of a popular light novel series in Japan, *but* the company who produced the anime wasn't getting the Japanese viewership they wanted (due in part to how bland the script was) and ended up losing a ton of money, nearly going bankrupt even. So, they sold the dubbing rights to ADV Films in Texas and told them they could do anything they wanted with the footage as long as the dub sold and made enough money for the animators to break even.\\nAs voice actress Monica Rial tells it, ADV's immediate response was *... anything?*\\nCue one of the most irreverent - and hilarious - anime dubs to ever exist. \\nThey kept character names and the basic skeleton of each episode's plot, but tossed out the script completely, in favor of turning it into an improv game for the VAs - whoever came in first that day got to set the tone for the scene, so long as they fit the lip flaps.\\nIt's basically a unicorn amongst anime dubs; due to the unique circumstances that ended up creating it, you'll probably never see anything like it produced ever again.\\n\\n(It is worth noting that as hilarious as it is, the dub isn't what you would call high class or politically correct. It was produced in Texas in the early 2000s, and is definitely a product of its time. Much like when playing Cards Against Humanity, you have to put away your standards of decency to watch it.)",0,0

And he traps them in this school, and the only way they can leave is if they kill one of their class mates and get away with it. The ‘and get away with it’ part is very important. If there is a murder then there is a full fledged investigation and a trial to find the murder and if the rest of the students get it right then the murder is “punished” (gets killed) by the principal. But if the students get it wrong then they all die and the murder goes free. ITS SO GOOD!! LIKE HONESTLY!!",0,0

I've seen so many interviews of other artists - I specifically remember Kelly Clarkson saying that too!!! P!NK can do anything, and the sky is the limit for her, and I LOVE how she keeps stretching that limit - pushing it higher and higher!?! Pink is totally setting the bar so high that she said this morning on an interview that she has no idea what she's going to do next and the interviewer suggested like her getting shot out of a cannon and she seriously said that someone actually mentioned that as a suggestion and I can't wait and see cuz she's so great I love how real she is with the kids and totally blunt and honest and speaks the truth of what's really going on in this world, and how she feels about it, and how it's affecting the world  Here and Now - and how she's terrified for the future for her kids and everyone else's kids as well!?!

KnE3055j-A0,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 \\n\\nAnd yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

KnE3055j-A0,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",0,0

It's supposed to mimic Rick & Morty... which debuted in 2013!\\n6. That is NOT the same recipe that McDonald's uses.  That's a random imitation.  Check Binging With Babish for the closest recreation possible.\\n7. Sriracha is not spicy ketchup.  Whataburger's Spicy Ketchup is spicy ketchup.  Sriracha is more of an Asian hot sauce.\\n8. Stand in line for some crappy homemade sauce over the fabled Szechuan sauce?  Blasphemy!\\n9. McDonald's Chicken McNuggets are the pinnacle of chicken nuggets.  Calling them leathery is a sin.\\n10. The crappy homemade one being better than the official stuff is another sin.\\n11. Can't even tell the difference between ketchup, BBQ sauce and Szechuan sauce?  Going straight to Hell.

Your eyes stand out a lot with makeup especially because they're light, it takes effort to choose a natural/ish look for brown eyes.

ADV bought it with the intention of making a goofy parody dub, and redoing it with updated jokes every few years, because it was basically easy profit that they could use for their serious dubs.",0,0

KZ6KpxURmks,"For the Americans that are triggered because we are comparing with the qualification of Iceland with USA and not India or China due to their large population is due to the infrastructure. First of all the USA is the richest country in the world and has the best athletic academies in the world, which China and India or Not. Second, YOU GUYS are a country made of Immigrants, With the vaste diversity in this country you guys still can't find 11 good players ? I mean yes football may not be the most popular sport in the US but just by counting the amount of football players in the US which are 4 millions (wikipedia) YOU GUYS can easily find a talented player. Yes, China and India have more citizens than the US but the difference is that these countries are POOR. Kids don't have a choice but working in farms or factories, these kids have lack of education which makes them have less chance to be in a team. With all the money that the USA is spending on MLS academies, European camps such as (PSG,Barca,Juventus,etc) YOU GUYS STILL SUCK. That's why it is more embarrassing for a team that has all the chance to be a World Class team to fail to qualify then a team that has no support and infrastructure.",3,0

P!NK can do anything, and the sky is the limit for her, and I LOVE how she keeps stretching that limit - pushing it higher and higher!?! Pink is totally setting the bar so high that she said this morning on an interview that she has no idea what she's going to do next and the interviewer suggested like her getting shot out of a cannon and she seriously said that someone actually mentioned that as a suggestion and I can't wait and see cuz she's so great I love how real she is with the kids and totally blunt and honest and speaks the truth of what's really going on in this world, and how she feels about it, and how it's affecting the world  Here and Now - and how she's terrified for the future for her kids and everyone else's kids as well!?!

KnE3055j-A0,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 \\n\\nAnd yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",0,0

KZ6KpxURmks,"For the Americans that are triggered because we are comparing with the qualification of Iceland with USA and not India or China due to their large population is due to the infrastructure.

Second, YOU GUYS are a country made of Immigrants, With the vaste diversity in this country you guys still can't find 11 good players ? I mean yes football may not be the most popular sport in the US but just by counting the amount of football players in the US which are 4 millions (wikipedia) YOU GUYS can easily find a talented player. Yes, China and India have more citizens than the US but the difference is that these countries are POOR. Kids don't have a choice but working in farms or factories, these kids have lack of education which makes them have less chance to be in a team. With all the money that the USA is spending on MLS academies, European camps such as (PSG,Barca,Juventus,etc) YOU GUYS STILL SUCK.

There's plenty of singers in their 50s that still look good real good so age is not an excuse. He's just a shell of his former self a star that faded out long ago. His ego ruined his career pure and simple. I really like to listen to them back in the day slash still has all the talent in the world one of the best guitar players ever my opinion.",1,0

1wwwXCQyIRA,"The foundation made me break out in little red spots (not pimples/active acne, almost like an allergic reaction as opposed to a breakout) but I really liked the way it looks when mixed with a luminous foundation for my dry skin - I used Koh Gen Do Aqua and the two seemed to play nicely together. If anyone's bought the foundation but has dry skin and finds it isn't working but also own a liquidy dewy foundation try mixing the two!",0,0
1wwwXCQyIRA,I have really dry skin and the formulas just did not work for me. I got the foundation as soon as it was released because of the color selection. I have a strong yellow undertone that is hard for me to match. The foundation and primer just made my skin look even dryer. I looked like I had more texture then I actually have.,0,0

KnE3055j-A0,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 \\n\\nAnd yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",0,0

KnE3055j-A0,"四川 (Szechuan) is a province in southern China, and is famous for their style of cooking.  The kind of flavors they use in the food spans a pretty wide range and to boil it all down to a single sauce is pretty silly.... it's like making a sauce that encompasses all the flavors of Indian food, or American food and calling it the American sauce or the Indian sauce....  the sauce you made is typical Szechuan affair - garlic, ginger, soy sauce, and chili flakes - since most Szechuan dishes are pretty spicy, while most dishes sounds really silly when translated (one of which is called ants climbing up a tree, which is ground meat cooked in a sauce - not unlike the Szechuan sauce you made - poured over noodles) the most famous would be Kung Pao Chicken.

Might have even found a way to inject it intravenously it was that good. Of course the chef couldn't remember the exact recipe but I do kind of get the hype. I can say without any reservation it was the best tasting edible I have ever ingested! Sorry about the wording but it kept sounding way way way wrong the normal way most would describe it! Lol,0,0

Well, a girl named Paige Buxton was on the show, not sure if you remember her or not. I know you had that series for a while and it was years ago and you had a lot of girls on that show. Anyways, yesterday marked a year from her passing. Jake Paul ran into her mom and he is trying to get in touch with her. You may not even have any way to get in touch with them, but if you do or have some kind of connection to them please contact Jake Paul. He is really trying to help their mom.

KZ6KpxURmks,A video about Iceland and everyone brings up the USA lol,10,4
KZ6KpxURmks,I'll never understand why people still think iceland invented the slow clap in the stands.,5,0
KZ6KpxURmks,"For the Americans that are triggered because we are comparing with the qualification of Iceland with USA and not India or China due to their large population is due to the infrastructure. First of all the USA is the richest country in the world and has the best athletic academies in the world, which China and India or Not. Second, YOU GUYS are a country made of Immigrants, With the vaste diversity in this country you guys still can't find 11 good players ? I mean yes football may not be the most popular sport in the US but just by counting the amount of football players in the US which are 4 millions (wikipedia) YOU GUYS can easily find a talented player. Yes, China and India have more citizens than the US but the difference is that these countries are POOR. Kids don't have a choice but working in farms or factories, these kids have lack of education which makes them have less chance to be in a team. With all the money that the USA is spending on MLS academies, European camps such as (PSG,Barca,Juventus,etc) YOU GUYS STILL SUCK. That's why it is more embarrassing for a team that has all the chance to be a World Class team to fail to qualify then a team that has no support and infrastructure.",8,2
KZ6KpxURmks,so why does it matter usa didn't qualify? the comments seem to make me think people that aren't from the usa cares. Because usa is powerful they have to win everything? i can't understand with obsession.\nsports don't really matter to me so i really don't understand why it matters just because usa has 320 million people. more people doesn't necessarily mean more wanting to play sports. most people don't need sports to succeed.,0,0

KnE3055j-A0,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 \\n\\nAnd yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",0,0

Might have even found a way to inject it intravenously it was that good. Of course the chef couldn't remember the exact recipe but I do kind of get the hype.

I would LOVE to hear in your ever so soothing tone your take on his lyric writing verses the abfood portion of the other material in the rap and hip hop genre, escapism vs an upfront of an ugly reality a good majority of people live, the way he's evolved a lyricist.

When he finally got close enough to Ed Kemper he saw him for what he truly was: A dangerous psychopath who could easily kill him before he'd even know what was happening to him.

GfqD5WqChUY,Fantastic as you do. I have a love hate relationship with Fincher in that he directed one of my top 5 movies of all time (fight club) but in an interview he said all people are pervs. Which bothers me cause I contest this notion. I used this video in one of my videos (in an artsy way) I will credit you in it even though I am small fries to your greatness. Thank you for doing what you do. Best day & Best wishes to you & yours. :),0,0

GfqD5WqChUY,"Stanley Kubrick was also obsessive about tracking shots timed precisely to begin and end with actor(s)' movement. Although his style, in many other respects, is not similar to Fincher's. Directors for generations have always attempted to hide audience awareness of camera movement in this way, but not until Kubrick did anyone have the gaul to demand the necessary and excessive number of takes. Good was always good enough. Kubrick was the first in my memory to get the synchronicity of the camera/actor dance silky perfect every time. In terms of those smaller camera movements, I'd have to look back to see if Kubrick did that at all. He liked more medium wide shots than Fincher.",0,0
GfqD5WqChUY,Im sure Fincher does a lot of rehearsal. But I’m betting he does a lot of visual effects tracking and stabilizing tricks  to get it right every time. It’s just too perfect most times.,0,0

GfqD5WqChUY,I noticed that when I was watching Benjamin Button. I actually noticed it very specifically. Do you know when? YESTER-FUCKING-DAY.

GfqD5WqChUY,About time you made a video on David Fincher! This was great!,0,0
GfqD5WqChUY,"Watching this, I wouldn't say that the camera movements hijack my eyes, I'd say that the way the way the frame moves and the objects / people it centers on is almost exactly what the human eye tracks and focuses on IRL. As you say, perfectionism - making the camera mimic what your eyes would if you were viewing and parttaking in the scene directly.",0,0
GfqD5WqChUY,The video essay was breathless in someway. Maybe the soundtrack did the trick,0,0
GfqD5WqChUY,"Our eyes also track movement in a similar way, so it might seem more like we are in the scene and watching the character rather than being shown them. This also explains why it seems like real life looks like Fincher's work. They didn't hijack our eyes, they replicated them.",0,0

GfqD5WqChUY,"This revelatory, thank you.\\n\\nAdding some history to this, what Fincher does in effect is that he maintains the relative position of an actor’s face within the frame unchanged.

GfqD5WqChUY,"Great video. But man, what happened to Every Frame a Painting?",0,0
GfqD5WqChUY,"I think that Fincher's camera work is the way it is because - as the camera represents the eyes of the audience, Fincher makes the camera mimic natural, human movement. This is why it feels immersive. If you watch his camera work, all the little movements, it's the same way a human watches something. Nobody in real life locks their focus and allows someone they're talking to move around within that frame, we move our heads and shift our gaze and track all the little movements.",0,0
GfqD5WqChUY,"Jesus Christ this is beautiful. David Fincher has always been my favorite director, but I never succinctly knew this.",0,0
GfqD5WqChUY,"There's probably a good amount of post-editing to get that tracking movement with actor movement just right, too.",0,0

GfqD5WqChUY,"Great channel nerdwriter. However, in this analysis there are very specific reasons that Fincher moves the camera that have to do with an established film language. The reframing of shots is used by almost all good directors, even if it means a simple twitch of the head. Also, the camera movement in films is always motivated by characters' movements, nothing new there as well. True, Fincher is meticulous with his shots and the stabilization of them, however the points made here are used by almost all working directors.",0,0
GfqD5WqChUY,Haha I thought this was gonna be a video about how you can't keep your eyes off some dude. This is way less gay,1,0
GfqD5WqChUY,"Fincher might be more sensitive to it than others. These days unmotivated camera moves and free flowing handheld with some miss-frames runs so rampant, that a strict adherence to a traditional discipline of camera operating does seem like something special in a way. However, motivated camera movement is very much a thing and they teach it to you in film school, even the shitty ones. Also those slight adjustments for the actors' movements, so the proper frame is maintained is also something you're supposed to do as a camera operator. \\n\\nI'd like to add that I'm not saying there's never anything unique about Fincher's style, and ultimately most auteurs' film making style does feel like a proverbial fingerprint. So I am not knocking this video at all. It was very engaging and captivating, however, most things it described weren't a special style unique to Fincher. I love that the author of this video noticed and appreciated it the details in it. Awareness and care for the frame, I feel, should be appreciated and spread. Like I said, there's so much of this handheld willy nilly non-technique way of shooting that people are calling a style, that I think a disciplined way of shooting like Fincher's is very appreciated.",0,0

GfqD5WqChUY,"NOT a Fincher fan myself. I've seen 'Se7en' but i think that's the only film of his i've even bothered with. It takes more than 'Real time camera movement' to get you involved in a character. I relate to characters that are well WRITTEN and remind me of people i know or characters i can see MYSELF in. Or characters that are in a situation i have been in and know how they are thinking and what leads to their actions. As i commented on another of your essays, i usually go to the movies to GET AWAY from reality and escape into a world that ISN'T reality. I don't want to see reality reflected back at me from a movie screen. And therefore, you have to ACCEPT the reality that the movie is presenting to you-be it 'Passable' or 'GREAT'.",0,0
GfqD5WqChUY,"Great exposé, but surely some credit must go to the various cinematographers Fincher has collaborated with, such as Jeff Cronenweth!",0,0
GfqD5WqChUY,"Great that you mentioned the camera operator, but especially in the case of Fincher, the dolly grip is equally, if not more linked to this style of camera movement. Many operators (such as myself) try to design our movement so that we dont have to do anything (pan or tilt) that the entire move is controlled by the dolly grip. Finchers known precision in this area makes his movement particularly concise, but he certainly did not invent or start the idea.",0,0
GfqD5WqChUY,"Wow.  Great eye, Nerdwriter.  I did notice this about MindHunter.. maybe subconsciously.  Particularly with how the killers moved.. Ed Kemper was terrifying and I could not put my finger on why (aside from the fact that he is a 6'9 psychopath).  I found myself on the last episode fixated on what he was going to do from the hospital bed, yelling at the FBI agent to get the hell out of there.   The movements and behavior of the serial killers is normal, the camera tracks that and I think that is why it is scary.  Many of these guys could be anyone.. and you just never know.",0,0

GfqD5WqChUY,"Wouldn't it make more sense to shoot zoomed out a little, crop the frame in post, and track that crop to the actor's face (or whatever)? You could be exactly perfect to the movement without needing the actor to plan every millimetre of their movement. Forgive me, I know little about film making, but I do know After Effects and design generally and if someone asked me to mimic Fincher's technique, this is how I'd do it.",0,0

v36OO-vZTQk,This is at best misleading. Go has a very simple set of rules with a very large amount of outcomes. So the ability to learn without a dataset depends heavily on having a simple set of rules. Many applications like autonomous cars however have a complex set of rules with a limited amount of (optimal) outcomes. So the sort of problems we'd like a generalized AI to solve wouldn't be feasible using this method.\n\nFurther the wording is just stupidly off. Assuming an AI could navigate its environment it could gather data about it without a human providing such a dataset. IN that sense it would have agancy over creating the dataset. Yet the milestone that AlphaGo Zero is actually accomplishing has nothing directly to do with humans providing it data. It has to do with an AI thats able to make generalizations about a very large possibility space with a very small set of rules.,0,0

GfqD5WqChUY,"https://youtu.be/diYAc7gB-0A This is David fincher George Michael MV Freedom. For my honest review it's was by far the greatest 90s music video I ever seen. The back stage (inside the old house) is almost the same as fight club old house after the MV is filming. You're right, the eye contact and the way they sing and movement is absolute brilliant. It's feel like a American Freedom (not offense, it true). For those who are not familiar to him or still new on his movie, I highly recommend you guys to watch this MV, with some famous 90s top model performance and a great George Michael song.... Very 90s nostalgic Enjoy :D",0,0
