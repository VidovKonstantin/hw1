Bench numbers look amazing and every day performance will likely follow suit. \\n\\n-software: photo options, UI with no home button looks super easy to adapt to\\n\\n-4K@60 and slomo. Damn tech is getting impressive across the board here. \\n\\n-fit and finish and presentation. The package is pleasing to me overall. I don't mind the notch at all. \\n\\nI was a bit disappointed by a few things:\\n\\n-screen brightness. Boo! \\n-no promotion/120hz refresh\\n-fuck 2x optical zoom. Samsung and Apple, get your shit together and give me something more useful here. \\n\\nI've owned both Apple and various android-based devices. In general, I find Apple to hold up better (lag less) and simply be a more fluid and enjoyable experience. Less buggy, more mainstream/supported and compatible with apps like e.g DJIgo4, etc. \\n\\nI'll probably wait for the next iteration of this one, but I like it. \\n\\nWhy has no mentioned the absence of the blush gold color option.

I love the idea and the locations and diversity of the food experiences etc you know what you do, but what i always find myself wanting more of is a bit of you and your partners in crime experiencing a little more of the locales than going straight to the eateries. Not to get all patriotic but Melbourne has been voted most livable city in the world 7 times running, i would have loved to have seen just a little more of you guys experiencing the location as i love your personalities before going straight to shots of happy eating faces. I know its the premise of the show but it seems such an effort to travel so far and not show any footage of you enjoying the actual location as well as the food.

He wouldn't bite the hand that feeds him, his own tribe I you know that much. He would overtax working class and ultimately keep the ridiculous power imbalances the same or make them worse. The worst thing he would have done is open immigration as a genocidal divide and rule and Europeans as the eternal scapegoat. He would likely recruit directly from antifa and BLM for supreme court and other critical institutions. His own Black campaign Spokeswoman came on CNN and outrageously shouted a sarcastic boohoo poor White people at an old man getting dragged out of his car and beaten only for supposedly voting Trump. And then they are surprised these people DID vote for Trump and call them stupid for doing so.

Imo it wasn't cute or funny, it honestly made me uncomfortable how unprofessional he was being by running his hands ALL over her w/o her consent. She genuinely seemed upset by the middle, and think she should definitely report him, or at least notify hiring manager that he should be given a warning regarding behavior. I mean, the difference in personal space and choreo between him and the other male dancers is astounding... He was 100% crossing the line, no question about it. Good thing is, knowing Lauren she prob did complain to management. So least that's something!",15,1

Or take the tack that photographers are evil, so whatever security does to them is fine. Whether Miss Hadid read the situation correctly (that her bodyguard's actions posed a physical threat to the photographer) is less important, IMO, then that she intervened (politely!) to diffuse a situation she thought might be/become dangerous to another person.

6vGg-jJl30A,"Nile, you have a wonderful family!  You are a special young man.  It is great getting to know you from your videos.  Throughout my life, I only watch Olympics and other than that, I am not one to follow sports.  Essentially, I watch only 2-minutes of sports per year is what I tell folks; as that is the length of the Kentucky Derby, which was started by a distant cousin of mine in 1875 and it is the oldest North American sport.  Getting to see more of the behind-the-scenes watching you and that seriously cute Tom Daley, and the other cute gay man, Steele Johnson, has all been fun.  Until Youtube, we only knew what little we saw about athletes on national TV.\\n\\nIt is great that you are documenting your career so be able to reflect on it in your future, but also to leave a positive legacy for your family.\\n\\nHey, your videos could be greatly improved by avoiding having the constant moving of the background where the brighter lights show up.  Always having the lights BEHIND THE CAMERA means that you are better illuminated and your camera has fewer problems trying to deal with that constantly changing background.  A tripod could greatly improve these issues.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, you need to always have Key (primary lighting on YOU), then a secondary lighting from one or both sides (but the light fixtures are not seen in the view of the camera), then a lower backlighting to dress (illuminate the background).\\n\\nAs you are using auto focus most of the time, then it is vital you don't have stronger backlights or the audience cannot see you or whatever you try to show.\\n\\nHaving that natural backlighting becomes too pronounced during segments of the video.  Finding somewhere for the sit-down interview is less upsetting for the audience than having too much swirling of your background scenery.\\n\\nRespectfully,\\nBrennan\\nCinematographer/aerial videographer/producer/etc.",0,0

And let's bring some attention to the notch where the camera and sensors are.  That will block part of your video content.

WYYvHb03Eog,Good point. That's a huge security problem - someone just needs to point your phone to your face to unlock it. And Face ID looks to take a bit too long anyway to register your face. I prefer Touch ID. I don't want to have to position my phone in front of my face and wait in order for it to unlock. The quick read on my fingerprint is more than enough and safe.,0,0

Apple is pricing it self out of the market and manufacturers like Huawei will reap the benefits by offering good products with similar functionality (P10, Mate etc) at half or almost half the price. I think savvy consumers who are looking for a high-end device will more likely gravitate towards 500 dollar android phones (which btw is already a lot of money) instead of paying over a 1000 dollars for an iphone. Most people don't require high-end security features or care about augmented reality capabilities. Most people want durable phones with good cameras, long battery life, and enough storage.

And let's bring some attention to the notch where the camera and sensors are.  That will block part of your video content.

WYYvHb03Eog,Good point. That's a huge security problem - someone just needs to point your phone to your face to unlock it. And Face ID looks to take a bit too long anyway to register your face. I prefer Touch ID. I don't want to have to position my phone in front of my face and wait in order for it to unlock. The quick read on my fingerprint is more than enough and safe.,0,0

Apple is pricing it self out of the market and manufacturers like Huawei will reap the benefits by offering good products with similar functionality (P10, Mate etc) at half or almost half the price. I think savvy consumers who are looking for a high-end device will more likely gravitate towards 500 dollar android phones (which btw is already a lot of money) instead of paying over a 1000 dollars for an iphone. Most people don't require high-end security features or care about augmented reality capabilities. Most people want durable phones with good cameras, long battery life, and enough storage.

That's why guys don't get protected in the same way. \\n\\n2) lots of times you'll hear that these security teams are assigned to the celebrity of which they have no control over and many don't like the way security handles things. Not just Bella Hadid.",0,0

oK4me2hI_Jo,I have to say that look you created was stunning. I just think you could do that using more reasonably priced makeup. I'm definitely willing to splurge and love Victoria Beckham but this is absolutely ridiculously priced and I can't see why anyone would spend the money. Why can't some of these celebs do more reasonable collaborations.,0,0

They are both phones technically made from Samsung so chill out.\n\ndual camera and face recognition -from LG Innotek\n3D flash memory - from Samsung electronics. made from SK Hynix which is another Korean company\nbattery - from LG Chem.  with Samsungs SDI\nOLED display -from Samsung Display and negotiating with LG currently \nPCB -from Samsung electronics\nother parts from BHI which is also a Korean company.,0,0

1L7JFN7tQLs,"I think chinese companies are already celebrating, because they now know that their market share is going to rocket next year. Apple is pricing it self out of the market and manufacturers like Huawei will reap the benefits by offering good products with similar functionality (P10, Mate etc) at half or almost half the price. I think savvy consumers who are looking for a high-end device will more likely gravitate towards 500 dollar android phones (which btw is already a lot of money) instead of paying over a 1000 dollars for an iphone. Most people don't require high-end security features or care about augmented reality capabilities. Most people want durable phones with good cameras, long battery life, and enough storage.  But hey, maybe I'm just a crank who thinks paying a thousand bucks for a phone is ridiculous.",0,0

The Keynote did not show us a single feature that is useful for professional content creators, The iPhone 5s is the only iPhone hich i can use to take macro images of my 3 x 2 centimeter products. The dual lenses on the new iPhones cant take closeups of small objects, because the telephoto lens starts fighting with the digital zoom lens, and get very blurry pics - i know i have an iPhone 7 Plus and its crap camera for professional product photography, and only good for selfies. In addition, the dedicated camera shutter buttons (volume keys) when try to use on top right of phone, show the camera lens on the bottom of the phone in landscape, which is upside down\\nvolume buttons end up with your other finger on the off button and locks screen when trying to raise or lower volume. bad design",0,0

zTjcPeb2Gwg,Hi Wil! I like you to see this video about T-cells reprogrammed to fight cancer... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kiDfLS0UXQ ....this is feasible although I dont know where these centers are... Are there any of it there in the states? Maybe somewhere in Silicon valley? I would dig deep enough where these centers are located and i would notify you. Just hang in there! May i know the type and kind of Cancer you have? I think you know this therapy is new in  its trial stage. But if you take a deeper understanding to this kind of Specific approach targeting the Cancer cells with T cells rather than just a shotgun approach like chemotherapy and radiation. It may even save your reproductive system and a lot of side effects that it may cause.\n\nYou know T cells are like specialized soldiers which is activated when it detects special proteins that are not normal or foreign inside the body. These T-cells are lethal and as last resort long term immunity given a specialized specific protein it makes a lock and key approach only targeting specific cells to fighting infection or foreign bodies and eats them away without harming other cells.,1,0

1L7JFN7tQLs,"I think chinese companies are already celebrating, because they now know that their market share is going to rocket next year. Apple is pricing it self out of the market and manufacturers like Huawei will reap the benefits by offering good products with similar functionality (P10, Mate etc) at half or almost half the price. I think savvy consumers who are looking for a high-end device will more likely gravitate towards 500 dollar android phones (which btw is already a lot of money) instead of paying over a 1000 dollars for an iphone. Most people don't require high-end security features or care about augmented reality capabilities. Most people want durable phones with good cameras, long battery life, and enough storage.

The Keynote did not show us a single feature that is useful for professional content creators, The iPhone 5s is the only iPhone hich i can use to take macro images of my 3 x 2 centimeter products. The dual lenses on the new iPhones cant take closeups of small objects, because the telephoto lens starts fighting with the digital zoom lens, and get very blurry pics - i know i have an iPhone 7 Plus and its crap camera for professional product photography, and only good for selfies. In addition, the dedicated camera shutter buttons (volume keys) when try to use on top right of phone, show the camera lens on the bottom of the phone in landscape, which is upside down\\nvolume buttons end up with your other finger on the off button and locks screen when trying to raise or lower volume. bad design",0,0

4X6a3G_0HjY,"Apparently what happened, was the female photographer got knocked forward far enough by other photographers, that she was about to cross the barrier. She lowered her camera to her side, and was trying to find a way to back up, but had no where to move to with all the other photographers trying to get pics.The security guard saw her about to cross the barrier/just starting to cross the barrier, and in an attempt to push her back, he shoved a little too hard, knocking her to her knees.",0,0

4X6a3G_0HjY,"After looking at the comments all I have to say is,\\n 1) Yes equality is great and essential but lets not forget biology. A woman is born physically weaker than a man. A man would be able to handle being roughed up like that more than a woman. That's why guys don't get protected in the same way. \\n\\n2) lots of times you'll hear that these security teams are assigned to the celebrity of which they have no control over and many don't like the way security handles things. Not just Bella Hadid.",0,0

Crying talking bout why is it only bad when he pushed the woman. Gtfo of here! Is your mother still breast feeding you? Just because women want to be respected doesn't mean you treat them like men. It means you treat them like the woman they are and not some punching bag or slave. It's that simple. I bet these men crying about it never got love from their father.

Their methodical slow release of tech ensures that consumers continue to purchase devices, expend our our natural resources, pollute our environment sending phones to the landfill sooner than necessary.

Apple is pricing it self out of the market and manufacturers like Huawei will reap the benefits by offering good products with similar functionality (P10, Mate etc) at half or almost half the price. I think savvy consumers who are looking for a high-end device will more likely gravitate towards 500 dollar android phones (which btw is already a lot of money) instead of paying over a 1000 dollars for an iphone. Most people don't require high-end security features or care about augmented reality capabilities. Most people want durable phones with good cameras, long battery life, and enough storage.

The dual lenses on the new iPhones cant take closeups of small objects, because the telephoto lens starts fighting with the digital zoom lens, and get very blurry pics - i know i have an iPhone 7 Plus and its crap camera for professional product photography, and only good for selfies.

4X6a3G_0HjY,"Apparently what happened, was the female photographer got knocked forward far enough by other photographers, that she was about to cross the barrier. She lowered her camera to her side, and was trying to find a way to back up, but had no where to move to with all the other photographers trying to get pics.The security guard saw her about to cross the barrier/just starting to cross the barrier, and in an attempt to push her back, he shoved a little too hard, knocking her to her knees.",0,0

4X6a3G_0HjY,"After looking at the comments all I have to say is,\\n 1) Yes equality is great and essential but lets not forget biology. A woman is born physically weaker than a man. A man would be able to handle being roughed up like that more than a woman. That's why guys don't get protected in the same way. \\n\\n2) lots of times you'll hear that these security teams are assigned to the celebrity of which they have no control over and many don't like the way security handles things. Not just Bella Hadid.",0,0

Crying talking bout why is it only bad when he pushed the woman. Gtfo of here! Is your mother still breast feeding you? Just because women want to be respected doesn't mean you treat them like men. It means you treat them like the woman they are and not some punching bag or slave. It's that simple. I bet these men crying about it never got love from their father.

WYYvHb03Eog,"The first smartphone, IBM Simon Personal Communicator, came out in 1994. A wild touchable screen, no keypad, and multiple capabilities in one are the unique selling point of Simon. However, most of the people get the concept of smartphone was when the first iPhone came out. Due to its slogan ‚ÄúApple reinvents the phone‚Äù, the first generation iPhone is a revolutionary device, people can listen music, play video games, browsing internet with it. Everything with a simple touch is what iPhone can bring people, and iPhone is just an example of the smartphone. People are getting more comfort through this new technology, because now instead of walk to a desktop and do all those complicated steps, they can just type the small screen, then they just send an email through their smartphone. People can use their smartphone to control the temperature of the room, or put some camera in their house, and by connecting to their smartphone, now they can see through their smartphone if any stranger went in their house while they are out for working or playing. \\nThrough all those advantages and comfort that from the first generation to the latest smartphone, there are also are disadvantages, and the biggest disadvantage is the smartphone actually cannot compete itself to those specific functional device, such as the graphic of smartphone‚Äôs videogame is just not as good as the graphic of X-box or PlayStation and the most famous videogame will only appear on them or a PC, Most of the smartphone‚Äôs GPU is also part of its CPU such as Apple‚Äôs A10 chip, the concept of its GPU is like the integrated graphics card on PC which is just not a competition to the dedicated graphics card which is the most gamer are using. Due to its lower quality graphics card, most of its games selling point is not the graphic part, but it is the virtual items, which is the more money you put in this game, the more powerful you going to be in the game which just separate its original purpose as a game.   \\nThe quality of the camera on smartphones is also not as good as those single-lens reflex cameras. Most of the smartphones‚Äô camera have average 10 megapixels, but a SLR camera have a at least 15 megapixels, and some of them can do more than 100 megapixels, also the SLR camera can add extended lenses which are capable to do more things than a smartphone‚Äôs camera, moreover a professional photographer will not use a smartphone to capture an important moment, and also those world famous photographer just prefers a camera, a real camera, for their profession. \\nIn school, a calculator (no matter it capable to graph or not) is a necessary tool to use, and the teacher probably would not want to see the student pulls a smartphone out in the class no matter the student is trying to calculate with the smartphone or doing something else, neither the parents wants to see their kids have a smartphone out while they are doing their homework. The problem in this is no matter if they are using as a calculator or as something else, people will still affect by their subconscious such as when you pull out your smartphone during a test, then the teach will think you are looking answer on the internet. Another simple example is smartphone must be turned off during the test (ACT, SAT, GED, etc.), a smartphone without power is less value than a brick. So the issues are not only just technological, there is also the society problem which is the smartphone cannot bring people trust due to its multiple in one features which is you can do something else besides use it to calculate numbers which it can also reflect the trust issue between human. If people trust each other, then smartphone would be totally okay to use on those biggest exams in the world, but essentially not.\\nSmartphones can make people‚Äôs life easier, and it also let us live in a comfort life, but is this the comfort that people want, does the people approves this ‚Äúunfinished device‚Äù which it does everything, but not the best of everything. People may say that the technology is just not there yet, just compare the different between the first generation smartphone and the latest smartphone, it is getting better. The problem is those bigger devices are also getting better or evolving, this could be a loop which is the smartphone is always one step behind. People may start thinking smartphone is just small mobile device, you cannot compare them, size matters. Either those two professional gaming device or a PC is way bigger than a pocket size iPhone, but if the purpose is to making people live more comfort, than why it is not the best? Does not the best give people the most comfort? Is this smartphone really the result of people trying to live in a comfort life, or it is the result of the laziness of people because it simplifies all those functions, and we all know that the simple version is not as good as the full version.",0,0

Their methodical slow release of tech ensures that consumers continue to purchase devices, expend our our natural resources, pollute our environment sending phones to the landfill sooner than necessary.

This *is* a religious  (and probably very controversial) answer, but if you have and church or bible studies, go back to Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden. Before, the humans and human race (of two beings) were perfect, as such the world too. When Eve took a bite of the apple, sin entered our bodies and lives. My school's chapel actually covered this two weeks ago. A few prime examples of this include Adam and Eve's son (I forgot the name, sorry) killed his brother over jealousy. That's two sins for the price of one basically. Another is that you know when toddlers or young children in general say mine? You don't need to teach them that. It's melted in their minds when they're born. \\n     Thanks for reading my excessively long and boring speech. I do not feel I should have taken the time to type it, but I did so anyways.",0,0

We have to believe that Jesus is is the son of God and that he is our Lord and Saviour. (John 3:16)\\n2. We have to accept him as our Lord and Saviour and believe that God raised him from the dead. (Romans 10:9)\\n3. Repent from all our sins. (2 Chronicles 7:14)\\n4. Be baptized in the name of Jesus. (Acts 2:38)\\n5. We have to have a deep relationship with him and pray to him and talk to him everyday. The only way to the Father is thru him. (John 14:6)\\n6. Read the Bible and learn the word of God. (Joshua 1:8)\\n7. Fast and pray. (Joel 2:12)\\n8. Speak the word of God to the ppl of the world. (Mark 16:15)\\n9. Do the Lord's will until we die. (Matthew 24:13)\\nOn Judgement day when we go before Jesus there will be many ppl who have prayed to Jesus and even done things in his name and Jesus will say to them depart from me I never knew U and they will go to Hell. This is why We have to have a deep relationship with Jesus and try to do everything he told us to do cause thats the only way we will make it to Heaven. (Matthew 7:20-23). We all fall short of the Glory of God and we are all sinners. (Romans 3:23) This is why Jesus came and died for our sins to be washed away so we could make it to Heaven. (Peter 3:18) Without Jesus we are doomed to Hell. (John 3:36) When we disobey God and sin, God curses us. (Galatians 3:10) God punishes us and puts curses on us to make us obedient to him cause he Loves us and wants us to do right. (Hebrews 12:6) Jesus sets us free from curses when we truly follow him. (Romans 8:2) Quit following everything else in the world like the Government, religion, schools, science, TV, movies, radio, and everything else. (Colossians 2:8) That is all ran by the Devil and his worshippers, the Illuminati. They lie to U and deceive U. Them and the fallen Angels who got kicked out of Heaven with Satan are trying to lead U to Hell. (Ephesians 6:12) \\nPut God 1st in your life. Never put anyone or anything before God, not your family friends job money or anything. (Matthew 6:33) If U Love Jesus then U hate evil. (Proverbs 8:13) Repent from all your sins. Pray to Jesus everyday. Pray to him for everything U need. (John 15:7) Pray to him and ask for forgiveness of your sins, thank him for everything. (Philippians 4:6)  Pray to him to heal U, give U peace, joy, strength, courage, protection, wisdom, knowledge, understanding, patience, direction, guidance, and for him to show U the truth. (Jeremiah 33:3) Do the Lord's will and he will answer your prayers.  (John 9:31) God gives us visions and he talks to us in dreams and shows us things. (Acts 2:17) When U die U will go before Jesus and he will judge U and either let U into Heaven or send U to Hell based on if U did his will. Those who don't do the Lord's will they will be sent to Hell. (Revelation 20:15) Hell is place where ppl will be punished and burn for eternity (Matthew 25:46) Heaven is a place that God has for the ppl who truly Love him. It is eternal paradise where U will be wit Jesus, the Angels, all the animals, and God's ppl forever. God says there will be no more death, we will have eternal life. We will not feel sorrow, we will not cry, and there will be no more pain. (Revelation 21:4) God says that we can't even imagine how amazing Heaven will be. (1 Corinthians 2:9) In Heaven we live forever, rejoice and be joyful forever. (Revelations 22:1-5)",0,2

QC-cMv0e3Dc,"The universe is not a giant graveyard. There is a God, and I will do my best to briefly show why believing in God is more reasonable than not believing.\\n\\nI was an atheist for a long time, it was nice to believe there was no consequences or objective morality because it allowed me to live however I wanted. However even with a layman's understanding of science you learn that there are laws for every material science. When looking specifically at physics it's mind blowing to learn how impossibly unlikely and accurate the constants and variables for things like gravity, strong force, weak force, etc. have to be in order for life to even be possible in the universe. If you do some of your own digging you find it is virtually impossible that our universe was created by mere chance if it is the only one. Which is one of the reasons why scientists speculate that there are infinite universes even though that is not a testable hypothesis, it is unscientific.\\n\\n How is it so unreasonable then to believe that there are fundamental metaphysical and moral laws in our universe, when nature from physics, chemistry, and biology show overwhelming evidence of supreme order? Assuming there are, then you have your answer to whether or not there is a God. If there is a God of supreme orderliness, then God is supremely good, and therefore he can not logically also be the author of chaos, entropy, and evil. These things must come from another source. This is what the Zoroastrians, Greeks, early Jews realized in their predicament of believing God potentially did both good and evil.  \\n\\nFrom here going from deism (there is a God that creates) to theism (God is conscious and has a will) is tricker. I'm going to make three assumptions for the sake of argument which I think are very reasonable. You obviously may or may not think so too. If you accept these assumptions then it is quite easy to see that theism is more logical than deism. \\n\\n 1. God must be aware of his decisions, because it makes no sense to have a non-conscious orderly creative force. A painter has to be aware of every detail to make a masterpiece, he can't sleepwalk through it. \\n2 God wants to make his will known, because as the state ideally enforces the laws of man for order and the general good so God must enforce the divine laws for our own good. God does not make laws just to punish you when you break them. \\n3. God has a purpose for his creation, specifically people. Out of the tens or maybe hundreds of billions of species that have lived on this earth for the last several billion years human beings have no equal in nature. And yes dolphins are smart, chimps use sticks as tools, but seriously no other animal can do what we do. Plan like we do, teach and learn from previous generations, build on progress, contemplate the universe, seek truth and knowledge, and perhaps most tellingly have a desire to love and be loved unconditionally. Nothing in this world can satisfy the infinite desire of the human heart, only the right relationship with God can make you feel at peace inside. \\n\\nIf you accept these premises you are ready to begin exploring theology\\nThere are four books in the world which claim to be written by God through man. We need to find the right one and see what it points to. \\n1. The Hindu scriptures/Vedas 2. The Bible 3. The Quran 4. The Book of Mormon\\n\\nMormonism is the easiest to refute because it was written in the 18th century. We know as a matter of historical fact that Joseph Smith was a convicted fraudster. The papyrus from Egypt he supposedly translated into the Book of Abraham was not what he claimed it was as we know from modern Egyptian scholars. His Book of Mormon which he supposedly received by divine revelation contained errors found only in the King James Version of the Bible, proving he is obviously a liar. \\n\\nI won't pretend to know that much about Hinduism but their notion that there are many gods runs contrary to what Aristotle taught on levels of perfection, namely that the most perfect form would achieve perfection by no actions at all, as opposed to all lower beings which strive to perfection by many actions (people) or a few actions (angels). Simply put since God is eternal his character is constant and perfect, unchanging. God does not take many forms because this violates this principle. Furthermore the Hindu gods are not meaningfully differentiable from other forms of paganism like the Greek pantheon, the Egyptian gods, Aztec gods, etc. they are anthropomorphisms of human behavior.  \\n\\nThe Quran teaches that Jesus was a prophet and was indeed the Messiah promised to the Jews. However Muslims claim he is not God. Yet as it says in the Old Testament if a prophet teaches things which are not true than they are not a true prophet. They are a false prophet. However Islam says that Jesus was indeed a prophet, but Jesus also claimed to be God (John 8:58, Mark 14:61-62, John 5:18). Either he was telling the truth or he is not a prophet. Muslims claim he is a prophet, but he can't be a prophet while claiming to be God without either being God according to Islam or being a liar.    \\n\\nThe Bible is the only book in the world where a man claims to be God. As the Lord said, Jesus answered, ‚ÄúYou say that I am a king. In fact, the reason I was born and came into the world is to testify to the truth. Everyone on the side of truth listens to me.‚Äù (John 18:37). \\n\\nThere is plenty of miracles and substantial evidence which points to the truth of the Catholic Church if you have an open mind. If you just absolutely need something concrete to grasp onto, Google the story or better yet check out Vatican Catholic's excellent Youtube video on the miraculous image of our Lady of Guadalupe whose cactus fiber material should have disintegrated naturally in 50 years and survived a catastrophic fire, acid being poured on it, yet survives 500 years later and you can go visit it in Mexico City to this day. Look into the Miracle of the Sun, where 70,000 people including many non-believers confirmed that the sun danced at Fatima and dried the soaking wet earth and healed people. The saints whose bodies did not rot after their death because of their holiness, the miracles of St. Padre Pio, Eucharistic miracles, I could go on and on.\\n\\n If you made it this far, thank you for reading and I pray that God enlightens you and opens your heart and soul to receive the truth and become who you were meant to be.",0,0

His responses were awful and I pray to God that his talking on the court in Boston is a hell of a lot better and more productive than his interview on First Take. I think Kyrie looks up to Kobe a lot and his demeanour in the interview and his language use (absolutely) sounded a lot like Kobe, but he didn't make much sense. He is trying to look intelligent and left most people thinking the opposite - that he's a young man looking ignorant, immature and dodging simple questions. Anyhow, good luck in Boston, Kyrie.",0,0

My teacher had warned me in the dream that he was coming. Also, he almost blacked out when he was picking me up from kindergarten because he died of liver disease from alcoholism. While he was officially found and declared dead in a pool of blood in his house two days later, we think he died that night.

QC-cMv0e3Dc,Ask a question for the next edition: https://www.reddit.com/r/CGPGrey2/comments/719f2d/ask_grey_5/,197,134
QC-cMv0e3Dc,"I understand the semantics behind his disagreement with Follow your Passion but to be fair of course you wouldn't give a person advice about a problem they don't have, I thought that was a bad argument. Many people are going through life not doing what they really want to be doing. Many people have abandoned their dreams because their parents won't support them to pursue it, they lack the faith to believe it can be accomplished and just study something they know will guarantee them money instead, or they were raised in a manner where they never even considered they could grow up to do something they really enjoy as a career. The difference is immediately apparent between a person who genuinely loves what they do and someone who is just there for the job. IF you believe love is a real emotion then why can't you feel that way about what you do? Also yeah I know some people just genuinely don't have a clue what their dreams are and this advice still doesn't help too much for those cases.",0,0

If he truly didn't feel like he wanted to answer the questions from guys like Max and Stephen A., he could have respectfully declined their offer to come on the show. Instead, he accepted and then gets offended when they tough questions in the way that they do. I'm pretty sure he's seen the show, so he already knew what he could have expected, and still he gave the answers he did in the way that he did... Which in an of themselves are telling enough. I wouldn't be surprised if he thinks he came out of this unscathed, but I suspect that he's going to find out that things looked at lot different to those watching from the outside...

tVtsp_mASno,"I lost a lot of respect for Kyrie Irving after the First Take interview, but when you think about it, his trade request and his appearance on First Take have a lot in common. He is going into both situations thinking he can handle them like a man, and in the end he ends up just making the situation worse and showcasing that he is still just a young ignorant kid. His responses were awful and I pray to God that his talking on the court in Boston is a hell of a lot better and more productive than his interview on First Take. I think Kyrie looks up to Kobe a lot and his demeanour in the interview and his language use (absolutely) sounded a lot like Kobe, but he didn't make much sense. He is trying to look intelligent and left most people thinking the opposite - that he's a young man looking ignorant, immature and dodging simple questions. Anyhow, good luck in Boston, Kyrie.",1,0

ErWde9LVg0A,I definitely love tutorials so much better then reviews! Sometimes your reviews on the crazy makeup are hilarious but I'll never get tired of watching a tutorial. I love to see all the different products you use for your foundation routine and how you change it up because I'm always trying to improve mine. I got into watching beauty youtubers because I just wanted to watch and learn from their tutorials. I'm sure they are time consuming and annoying to edit but I love them and when you do make them I'll always watch! Xoxox,0,0

Demons are always watching, which is how they know what's going on in our lives, and they try to manipulate, confuse, and possess.  Mainly they do this by attempting to get us to go to mediums in order to figure out what grandma really wants to say.  That's one of the easiest ways for a demon to get into a person's body because a channel gets opened.  Obviously demons are visiting mediums because grandma went to a medium with a specific personal message for her.  It's not grandma, it's a demon pretending to be someone else, trying to confuse people about the other side, and ultimately trying to get you to go to a medium in an attempt to possess you.",2,0

Many people have abandoned their dreams because their parents won't support them to pursue it, they lack the faith to believe it can be accomplished and just study something they know will guarantee them money instead, or they were raised in a manner where they never even considered they could grow up to do something they really enjoy as a career. The difference is immediately apparent between a person who genuinely loves what they do and someone who is just there for the job.

It is none of your business. Nice try... next question. \\n\\nI didn't have to tell Lebron anything... \\n\\nHe doesn't need to tell him a damn thing. He is a grown ass man and it is a business. If Will is taking off to CNN he isn't consulting with Max and SAS... he is consulting with his family and closest advisers. \\n\\nThere was more insight and there was more honestly in his anger towards you (Max) in the entire interview. \\n\\nWell again, Kyrie has a ruling class mentality and is no mental midget. He knows damn well that Max understands the Cavs can't beat the Warriors this year anyways. Kyrie also knows Max is under the full understanding that Lebron is leaving Kyrie high and dry at the end of the year. Which makes all this you have a better chance to win with Lebron talk absolutely moot in his mind.\\n\\nI'm not here so slam Kyrie. \\n\\nFuck you ain't lol \\n\\nIf you are mad at people like Max Kellerman and your career desire is to prove them wrong... then just lay it out there. \\n\\nYa, wrong guy Will... Again, Kyrie doesn't give a damn about Max or others like him. His father did a good job with him and his lack of antics on and off the court prove that. Save that talk for the Lebrons and Durants of the world that hang their lives on what others are saying about them on social media. \\n\\nI said I would take Isiah Thomas over Kyrie.. \\n\\nWill, your basketball knowledge is showing... \\n\\nIt would best serve Kyrie to be off ball a little bit and Lebron on ball.. and Kyrie went along with it. \\n\\nNot one player to ever play with Lebron has a choice in his ball dominate bullshit. Please stop Max. Went along with it...smh\\n\\nWe have decided what should be important to a player... and that's winning championships. \\n\\nHe won a championship simpleton (literally hit the big shot to win it...)  Now he wants to do his own thing like many before him. \\n\\nand I asked him doesn't that diminish your chances of winning a championship and he could not answer that question. \\n\\nWell he is a guy who is raised by a father and is ready for the challenge in front of him. So to answer that question... the Cavs have a shot in hell next year... and Lebron is leaving him high and dry the year after that... Makes perfect sense that joining one of the top sports organizations in the history of sports will give him a better shot than a guarantee loss next year and the subsequent horrible rebuilding faze in Cleveland that follows. \\n\\nY'all at ESPN are idiots.",0,0

If he truly didn't feel like he wanted to answer the questions from guys like Max and Stephen A., he could have respectfully declined their offer to come on the show. Instead, he accepted and then gets offended when they tough questions in the way that they do. I'm pretty sure he's seen the show, so he already knew what he could have expected, and still he gave the answers he did in the way that he did... Which in an of themselves are telling enough.

tVtsp_mASno,since some of y'all refuse to read between the lines so heres the meat of the interview.\n\n\n\n\nHinted to coaching- when he mentioned brad Stevens and went back to it talking about him not being a PG because he said things like in Boston he would get to disect the defense. He went out his way to say things like that which tells you easily he wasn't doing much of that in Ty Lue aka brons offense.\n\n\n\n\nHinted the organization - THIS PART HE BLATANTLY just said but then covered it up with a whole bunch of talk afterwards. everyone knows Lebrun holds franchise hostage and Kyrie didn't even know Lebrun was coming when he signed that extension. not to mention Lebrun has forced sooo many moves that have crippled the cavaliers in the future when he leaves. so why would Kyrie be happy playing for legions left overs of a team in a orginization ran by a bad owner?\n\n\n\n\nBatman/robin complex- that people think Kyrie is only great With Lebron. Which is why he was pissed at Kelerman because everything he said was about Lebrun and with Lebrun. And¬†\n\n\n\n\nKellerman himself only considers Kyrie just a great weapon\nnot being a actual PG at Cleveland - this was pretty blunt\n\n\n\n\nLebrons impact on playing - everyone says he can't play without Lebrun so when Kellerman was asking him about Lebrun he made sure to go out his way to point out kellermans old takes on the show of Kyrie. proving he not only disagrees but wants more for himself in the offense and couldn't get that in Cleveland. Also proves he watches the show\n\n\n\n\nand lack of respect due to unhappiness. - the whole damn interview¬†\nhe planned this before the playoffs meaning during the season possibly end he came to this realization he didn't wanna play but kept it low-key because the media blows everything up and he couldn't tell anyone because it ruin there playoff run\n\n\n\n\nand I can tell half y'all have rarely heard KYRIE speak because he's ALWAYS WORDY Like that.,1,0

tVtsp_mASno,"Let me help you out Will Cain. I have a ruling class mentality much like Kyrie so I can translate point for point: \\n\\n.... and he said who cares. \\n\\nSimply, who cares if you guys on First Take have that information. It is none of your business. Nice try... next question. \\n\\nI didn't have to tell Lebron anything... \\n\\nHe doesn't need to tell him a damn thing. He is a grown ass man and it is a business. If Will is taking off to CNN he isn't consulting with Max and SAS... he is consulting with his family and closest advisers. \\n\\nThere was more insight and there was more honestly in his anger towards you (Max) in the entire interview. \\n\\nWell again, Kyrie has a ruling class mentality and is no mental midget. He knows damn well that Max understands the Cavs can't beat the Warriors this year anyways. Kyrie also knows Max is under the full understanding that Lebron is leaving Kyrie high and dry at the end of the year. Which makes all this you have a better chance to win with Lebron talk absolutely moot in his mind.\\n\\nI'm not here so slam Kyrie. \\n\\nFuck you ain't lol \\n\\nIf you are mad at people like Max Kellerman and your career desire is to prove them wrong... then just lay it out there. \\n\\nYa, wrong guy Will... Again, Kyrie doesn't give a damn about Max or others like him. His father did a good job with him and his lack of antics on and off the court prove that. Save that talk for the Lebrons and Durants of the world that hang their lives on what others are saying about them on social media. \\n\\nI said I would take Isiah Thomas over Kyrie.. \\n\\nWill, your basketball knowledge is showing... \\n\\nIt would best serve Kyrie to be off ball a little bit and Lebron on ball.. and Kyrie went along with it. \\n\\nNot one player to ever play with Lebron has a choice in his ball dominate bullshit. Please stop Max. Went along with it...smh\\n\\nWe have decided what should be important to a player... and that's winning championships. \\n\\nHe won a championship simpleton (literally hit the big shot to win it...)  Now he wants to do his own thing like many before him. \\n\\nand I asked him doesn't that diminish your chances of winning a championship and he could not answer that question. \\n\\nWell he is a guy who is raised by a father and is ready for the challenge in front of him. So to answer that question... the Cavs have a shot in hell next year... and Lebron is leaving him high and dry the year after that...

tVtsp_mASno,Kyrie owes no one an explanation. This is silly. A grown man can do what he wants if it's not illegal or hurting anyone. They're upset that they didn't get what they wanted out of him. What they wanted was an even bigger story to cause more friction.,0,0

If he truly didn't feel like he wanted to answer the questions from guys like Max and Stephen A., he could have respectfully declined their offer to come on the show. Instead, he accepted and then gets offended when they tough questions in the way that they do. I'm pretty sure he's seen the show, so he already knew what he could have expected, and still he gave the answers he did in the way that he did... Which in an of themselves are telling enough. I wouldn't be surprised if he thinks he came out of this unscathed, but I suspect that he's going to find out that things looked at lot different to those watching from the outside...

tVtsp_mASno,since some of y'all refuse to read between the lines so heres the meat of the interview.\n\n\n\n\nHinted to coaching- when he mentioned brad Stevens and went back to it talking about him not being a PG because he said things like in Boston he would get to disect the defense. He went out his way to say things like that which tells you easily he wasn't doing much of that in Ty Lue aka brons offense.\n\n\n\n\nHinted the organization - THIS PART HE BLATANTLY just said but then covered it up with a whole bunch of talk afterwards. everyone knows Lebrun holds franchise hostage and Kyrie didn't even know Lebrun was coming when he signed that extension. not to mention Lebrun has forced sooo many moves that have crippled the cavaliers in the future when he leaves. so why would Kyrie be happy playing for legions left overs of a team in a orginization ran by a bad owner?\n\n\n\n\nBatman/robin complex- that people think Kyrie is only great With Lebron. Which is why he was pissed at Kelerman because everything he said was about Lebrun and with Lebrun. And¬†\n\n\n\n\nKellerman himself only considers Kyrie just a great weapon\nnot being a actual PG at Cleveland - this was pretty blunt\n\n\n\n\nLebrons impact on playing - everyone says he can't play without Lebrun so when Kellerman was asking him about Lebrun he made sure to go out his way to point out kellermans old takes on the show of Kyrie. proving he not only disagrees but wants more for himself in the offense and couldn't get that in Cleveland. Also proves he watches the show\n\n\n\n\nand lack of respect due to unhappiness. - the whole damn interview¬†\nhe planned this before the playoffs meaning during the season possibly end he came to this realization he didn't wanna play but kept it low-key because the media blows everything up and he couldn't tell anyone because it ruin there playoff run\n\n\n\n\nand I can tell half y'all have rarely heard KYRIE speak because he's ALWAYS WORDY Like that.,1,0
tVtsp_mASno,The man is entitled to make any decisions he wants to make he is a grown man. This shit sounds like slavery black people have the right to live our lives any we choose to without the written permission of white people.

tVtsp_mASno,"Sad thing is that this interview was more about lebron than kyrie. Like kyrie said to max, I made my decision now stop thinking more into like there has to be something else going on behind the scenes. The man wanted to leave and play somewhere else to create something for himself. Stop asking the man question about Lebron James damn",1,0

Not the look what's in my shopping/pr bag videos. Or splice it in two parts. One just showing what you got and the other half using the products. We hear you're excited to use products but we don't really get to see how they went.

_Eb9kppyRxc,"Omg something Ike that happened to me, but it wasn't paralysis. In 5th grade, one of my closest friends from Japan killed herself. She did so because of the sexual harassment from intermediate school kids. Soon it became harder and harder for her, but she never told any of us, until one person spoke up about it. But then it was too late. She was sexually assaulted and then she couldn't take anymore. And now, set present date, years later, about last year something happened. I was hanging out with my friends and one girl introduced herself and became part of the group. She had brown hair and green eyes, with olive skin. She was pretty you could say, but really, really mean. About a week after she became a part of our friend group, I had the dream. For some weird reason, I was also at a wedding, but it wasn't the day before, it was the day of the wedding. I looked down at my dress ant it a flatly curled dress, with small padded shoulders, it was ugly in my opinion. But something that set me off was that my hair a blonde, and I have brown hair. I ignored it and went on with the dream. The guy I was marrying sort of looked like Alfie I guess, I can't remember well. The wedding took place a platform, there were pink and white petals everywhere and the platform was right about the ocean. It was connected to a big fancy plaza and I thought it was pretty cool. Suddenly, from the distance, somebody pointed out a tsunami from afar, coming towards us. Everybody freaked out, but for some reason, nobody went into the plaza to get help or something. But suddenly, the tsunami hit, even thought it was miles away. It only lasted for a couple second and by the end, I was completely dry, so was everybody else. I went into the plaza to see if anyone recalled what just happened. But then I saw her. My friend from Japan. Standing in a pink and green dress and smiling at me. But when I looked at her, my vision turned a deep shade of purple, everything was purple, but she was yellow. And she grabbed my shoulders, her eyes were completely white, and she told me that Mkayla (name of the mean girl) was going to conflict something one day. Her eyes started spinning, and she got closer and closer, but then I woke up. As soon as I did, I texted my best friend. She said she had the same dream (she was also friends with the her during 5th grade), except her vision was green, while the girl was red",0,0

_Eb9kppyRxc,"*Gonna put a little story/example of Gabbie's quote right here.*\\n\\nSo I've got a Jehovah Witness aunt & cousin that I'm living with during the week because I've got evening classes at my local college, and it'd be too inconvenient for me to head home after them. So I stay with her for the week and then go home over the weekend.\\nSince she's a Jehovah's Witness, she goes to meetings every Sunday and Wednesday evening. Wednesday rolled around and she went to her meeting right after work instead of coming home and going to the meeting after. Before she left for work, she goes, Meeting is at 6 o'clock. Prepare yourself. I used to be an avid church-goer when I was a kid (cause I was basically forced to), but now that I'm 21 & old enough to think for myself, I'm not so much of a church-goer anymore. So naturally, I didn't go. Usually I would, because I know she gets pissy, but after seeing this video yesterday I said to myself, If it makes you miserable, why put yourself through it? You don't want to go.\\nShe came home and 1st thing she says as she enters the door:\\nHer:<Insert my name>, why didn't you come to the meeting?\\nMe: Because I didn't want to.\\nHer: Well you cannot live here if you don't want to. This is our lifestyle, it's how we live, you cannot be here if you don't want to follow our lifestyle. If something happens to you, I'm to blame. You cannot stay here if you don't come to the meetings.\\nAnd she went into her room.\\n\\nIt wasn't a *HUGE* mistake like in Gabbie's video, but it made me realise how much I was putting my happiness/comfort-ability on a back burner for other people. So Gabbie, thank you. <3 <3\\n*_You can't make the biggest mistake of your life just because you don't wanna piss people off._*",1,0

ErWde9LVg0A,"I do love tutorials! I think the reason why they might not get as many views is because most tutorials are not planned out. Like I know most ppl choose I few things they wanna use, but then they tell us their just gonna wing it and have no real plan for the tutorial or how it's gonna look. So it doesn't feel as though there is much effort put into it and I know a lot of ppl are petty and aren't gonna watch something to give someone money for just sitting down in front of the camera and doing whatever. It makes the person not feel as professional bc their pulling the makeup look our of their ass? I hope that make any sense! In contrast, reviews are well thought out and take time to come up with (unless it's a first impression) so it seems more professional and thought out.",0,0
ErWde9LVg0A,"I love tutorials!!!!!

mJSViC_Sx20,"Oh god don't make her fall for the other guy, I loved how the first season ended because they were just friends. First of all, what a damn cliche, the damsel in distress trope, where the female just HAS to love the weird socially awkward new guy because he's the lead and wants her; she has to drop everything else she had going for the 'hero' because he 'deserves' to get her since he just did the right thing that any good human would do and 'saves' her, even though he was a total creep that didn't respect her and she already has a great boyfriend, not that she needs him either. It teaches girls AND guys that if the guy does something 'good' that she owes him sex, or dating which equals sex, that guys should get whatever girl they want, even if they don't respect her, as long as he does something redeeming or is important, and the girl HAS to because it's owed, otherwise she's a bitch. \\n      It's misogynistic and it teaches people that guys and girls can't just be friends, and if a girl doesn't like you back, you don't need to respect that, and just pine for her until she basically feels overwhelmed with guilt and gives in. I'm sure 11 will just 'like totally' have to fall for Nancys brother because HE likes her and let her sleep in his basement so it's owed, and like all girls want is to be all about boys, even a badass like her. üòñ Yuck, why, why did you have to ruin this, Netflix?!! üò´",1,0

Yeah there's a 5% fee but it's 5% out of a load of money that you otherwise never would have had. If the world was a more just place they would have been paying 100% because they would have been investing their profits from their previous vastly overfunded, low-effort project into the new project.

oStLD-yYAy0,"Using Pusheen to talk about Exploding Kittens.... :P\\n\\nAnyways, this only works for people who can pull off the crowd, on the project side. For people who already have a huge following, it's a no brainer.\\nOn the backer side there's a whole bunch of stuff you have to go through to elevate chances that the project will actually deliver.\\nCards and books in general are relatively simple. Stuff like Blu-ray versions for already released content is also doable. Video projects like documentaries highly depends on team. Things start becoming harder when it's stuff like games and software in general. Then comes hardware, which is an entire other beast, and the last tier would be something that is both hardware and software.\\nThere are just too many fresh out of college teams going there for their first attempt on product release which usually ends pretty badly.\\nAnd then there's the straight out scams.\\n\\nHonestly, I'm glad that crowdfunding exists. There's a whole bunch of content that came out of it that would probably never see the light of day otherwise. Then again, I wouldn't recommend spending any money on those for anyone unless you are prepared to just lose it all. You, as a backer, are assuming the role of something between an investor and a donator. Investor because you have all the risks of losing money that an investor does, donator because you are not guaranteed all the controls and transparency that an investor has. A whole lot of stuff is left to the goodwill of project leaders, like transparency, honesty, accuracy in reports and descriptions, workflow, fund administration, etc etc.\\n\\nI'm nowhere near the guy who showed up on the video... 2000 projects is a whole lot of money. But I've backed some 20+ projects, very selectively. Out of those, 1 failed catastrophically - project failed, company went bankrupt, no refunds. Didn't put a whole lot of money on it anyways, but still. I think 2 of them failed but returned the money. Majority of them delivered late. And a few delivered on time or even earlier than predicted.",0,0

oStLD-yYAy0,"I learned a hard lesson about Kickstarter. If you have no friends, no social media presence BEFORE you launch, you will most likely never even be seen. About half way through my campaign, I started buying placement at the top of the suggested lists. I even bought expensive mailing lists to send off press kits to hundreds of bloggers, writers and columnists. But if what you've got isn't an app, or hip and trendy, it will often not get an external write-up. I mailed off free samples to other Kickstarter campaigners who were already larger or clearly have been funded, just to get them to try my product, and give a shout-out in their email updates.\\n\\nWhich is kind of a weird concept, but now it's almost expected part of the community of Kickstarter creators. I even backed several projects just to be able to message the creator in a quid-pro-quo trade of mentions. My project was running during the Coolest campaign, so I was naturally being drowned out by their buzz. So I backed the Coolest, sent the guy a free sample of the product. He even wrote back and said he loved my product. But refused to give a mention in any of his hundreds of backer email updates. Stating he was trying to stay laser focused on getting his project off the ground and that he was NOT going to promote anyone else's campaign within his backer update emails. And only 2 backer update emails later, there he was promoting some other random product that already reached it's funding goal and didn't need the mention.",0,1

8rhb5wTCero,"My interpretation of this is that the pain in her shoulders is the weight of carrying something that nobody else can see (‚Äúsomething that is weighing you down‚Äù). When she keeps reaching her arm in the air it‚Äôs almost like she‚Äôs signalling for a taxi which is her trying to escape from whatever is bothering her. Near the end you see all the other girls with pains in their shoulders, showing that everyone has something that‚Äôs getting to them, just because you may not see it on the outside, doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not there (like mental illnesses or an abusive relationship).

8rhb5wTCero,So I think the shoulder touching is an anxiety and stress thing as I tend to touch my shoulder and hug myself when ever I'm anxious and feeling down and out of place thus 6/10.\n6/10 goes as saying that you feel average the plain girl the one that everyone over looks and dies in the background of everyone else's life and this video shows stages of this happening.\nThe girl in the coffee shop who knocks over your drink you then go home complaining calling her the coffee shop girl\nThe slow arm raise in the alley she's trying to reach out and show she's somebody else and this isn't what she wants which leads to looking into the mirror and not feeling the sense of realness (derealization.)\nThen the room of people with what looks like audition sheets. She's thinking it's a good idea because then she can become somebody else that's not herself even for short moments it would feel good.\nThe taxi- Needing to get away because everything's turned black and white and she doesn't know where she is going any more so she goes in a Taxi to somewhere far where she isn't The plain girl.,0,0

8rhb5wTCero,I didn't realise how much I wanted this video,0,0
8rhb5wTCero,I think the small shoulder and hand movements are signs of anxiety. Sometimes she begins to dance but then becomes self concoious and  instantly stops to rub her arms or grab her shoulder. Like she wants to do something but just can't. Maybe her doing those little ticks calm her down or ground her. When she goes into the waiting room her anxiety gets the best of her and she thinks that no one wants her there and dodie continues to do her shoulder thing. Little does she know that everyone else in the room and anxiety or whatever the shoulder represents and all of them are going through something similar.,0,0

Ostrisized or social axiety, body image, getting verbally abused. The verbally abused was clear twice and implied with the cell phone scene. I thought a lot of the gestures were to convey stress and anxiety. An inner monolgue with the I know that you don't want me here part was fantastic. Taking place throughout a day's time was great.

8rhb5wTCero,what ?????? \nDodie you is 100/10,5,0
8rhb5wTCero,This is a beautiful song with a beautiful message,0,0
8rhb5wTCero,This reminded me a bit of the dance in The OA,0,0
8rhb5wTCero,"You won't like this comment, you may even consider it to be a hateful comment, it is not, it's just my concern. \\nConcern of the person who's also struggling with depression and anxiety, who takes medication and who has problem to get up in the mornings. Oh and that sweet time my friends came to my home to tell my mom I'm suicidal, or that time I had to be taken by emergency car to the hospital because my panic attack wouldn't stop after an hour of shaking.\\n\\nAnyway. I know what it's like so what makes me different? I'd say my age, I'm much older than the average of dodie's fans and I want to warn you kids, and yes kids, even you 16-17 years old, you're kids, trust me. You are impressionable, in a desperate need to find your place in this world, you're lost, you're unpopular, you're sad, you spend too much time on youtube and tumblr. And then there's dodie, a young artist singing about your feelings and you feel like there's more of you, like you belong. Belong to this club of special snowflakes, of a club of depressed. You know how many of you are actually depressed? Maybe a half, I'd say a third. I am not dismissing your illness. If you're struggling with depression, please go see a doctor, ask your mom, ask your family for help, ask at school, call the help number, don't suffer on the internet, get help first.\\n\\nIf you're sad, you may not feel sad in a short period of time, it is okay to feel sad and lost but sad is not the same as depression. You want to be included to some group because people do this, we want to feel we are in a group, this group will protect us. And you chose to be in this club of pretty depressed people because you're sad and you feel like you belong. \\n\\nDodie did a very brave move when she started to talk about her illness, however she made a huge mistake by glamorizing the illness. There's nothing pretty about depression. There's nothing pretty in tears, in fears, in struggling to feel happiness. It's scary and lonely and even I wear my brightest lipstick on my bad days and I go out with my friends. But I do not promote a pretty depression. What we see with dodie is a pretty skinny girl, surrounded by friends, fans, art, beautiful fashion, aesthetic style and quirky smiling instagram posts. Those are her coping mechanisms and believe me I understand and I try those but you know what it also does? It promotes depression as something pretty, as something worth to have because with depression you can be like dodie, you can be pretty, you can be in this club of misunderstood very very sad people and that's wrong.\\n\\nDepression should to be warned about and spoke about but the last thing this illness has to be is to be promoted and never ever glamorized.\\n\\nI'm sorry, dodie, but it got out of hand and seems like you attract people to be depressed to be like you and those are impressionable young people who want to follow and they do follow and it's so wrong to make a mental illness your brand... it's low to make money of a brand like this.\\n\\nI am sorry to anyone who read this whole comment, call it hate, I don't mind, I think a bit of awareness and new opinion was needed and I really hope those of you who are ill will find your way to heal and those of you who are temporally sad will shortly get to their bright days again but I really ask you not to fall down this rabbit hole of depression just to feel special, thank you.",0,0

8rhb5wTCero,"I love this so much.... the way I see it, the shoulders and arms moving up represents the anxiety of each person. And when they push it down, they are trying to control it and keep it hidden. And feeling like a 6/10, to me, means that Dodie feels just above average (5/10). Meaning that she isn't doing great, but she's doing okay; she's able to somewhat control everything: the emotions, the anxiety, etc.\\n\\nIdk. These are just my thoughts on it.",0,0
8rhb5wTCero,"dodies main thing she talks about is when she feels like she‚Äôs drunk when walking around, not taking in the environment, feeling dazed everyday. her arms floating is her mentally floating away, she physically has to bring it down and force herself to try and feel like she‚Äôs not drunk, like she‚Äôs back on earth. the reason she winces and holds her shoulder is because the weight of depression or anxiety is like a ton of bricks on her shoulders. that room she was in, it was full of people looking down at their phone or journals, they all have to document what‚Äôs going on in their life so they can either remember their day (because dodie has trouble remembering when she‚Äôs dazed) or maybe as a distraction, or maybe just to get it off their chests so they don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúbother‚Äù other people with what their feeling. but they won‚Äôt look at each other. they won‚Äôt acknowledge this pain and frustration even though they‚Äôre all in the same environment, even though they all suffer the same. my take on this is just showing her day to day struggle in a beautiful 3 minutes, and to show that even if it‚Äôs not talked about, there are people out there who suffer the same. i cried and i don‚Äôt know if i even got anything right, but it‚Äôs how i see it and ya how it affects me. i love dodie so and to see her cry at the end shatters my heart. she‚Äôs a strong woman, and i wish her nothing but the best",0,0

GRDoasFyesU,Tip! If you plan on wearing the wig with the cap try picking up a dark coloured wig cap so it doesn't show through the wig! Light coloured caps work better with light coloured wigs so it doesn't look like weird patches :) also netted caps are a lot more comfy than stocking caps!,0,0

GRDoasFyesU,From far away and on their Instagram account they made it look so easy and so pretty and natural af but in real life you can see everything,0,0
GRDoasFyesU,"How you cut and apply a wig depends on what you‚Äôre wearing it for. For everyday kind of use, you just trim back the lace as close to the baby hairs as you can. You secure the wig down by having a wig cap on, and using bobby pins to secure it in place. Under the wig cap you can do multiple things. You can do a wrap, you can do pin curls, you can do anything that holds the hair flat and gives your natural hair some shape or texture for the pins you put through the wig to grip on to. For stage, you‚Äôd leave the lace long (with repeated use the lace gets shitty and you have to trim it back. Eventually you run out of lace and you have to get it replaced) and use adhesive to stick the lace down around the face. Never put adhesive in the hair because that just ruins it. Sometimes the wigs natural hairline doesn‚Äôt match your own so you just kind of have to fiddle with it and find a way to disguise any lace that stands out. You can use makeup to cover it too",0,0

GRDoasFyesU,Also there are usually clips on the inside to help keep the side down.. but look up  got 2 be glued method,0,0
GRDoasFyesU,I specialize in making and showing how to lay wigs down to look natural. You shouldn‚Äôt have to pull any of your natural hair out while wearing Freedom wigs. And also make sure there is a elastic band sewn in so it for snug to the head. Lastly do two braids to the back of your head and pin them. And if you use stocking cap pull it back away from hairline so you don‚Äôt see it in the front. Hope this helps ladies. Also here is my video üòâ https://youtu.be/8BzfjSc1RNs,0,0

Do they get hungry, thirsty or even die of natural causes? Cos' maintaining your horse is a whole new gameplay mechanic not encountered before and will be very interesting to see in game.",0,1

8rhb5wTCero,"This made me want to cry so hard, because I get it. I get how uncomfortable it feels to be a 6/10, I know what it's like to look around in silence and just wanting to leave because you're making everyone else feel uneasy with your trouble. \\nAnd I loved your hands, how you moved. It felt like you were trying to touch something you can't quite understand. And it also felt forced, in a good way though, because when you feel like that you don't really know how to place or move your hands, so this little awkward dance starts and everything just doesn't seem right. \\nYour outfit at the end also reminded me of the audition scene in La La Land, I don't remember if the clothes were the same but it reminded me of that. \\nI just love this song so much, it just hits so close to home. Feeling like this to me it's the norm. \\n\\nGood job to everyone involved. Sammy Paul just knows how to portray emotions in the best way possible.

GRDoasFyesU,I specialize in making and showing how to lay wigs down to look natural. You shouldn‚Äôt have to pull any of your natural hair out while wearing Freedom wigs. And also make sure there is a elastic band sewn in so it for snug to the head. Lastly do two braids to the back of your head and pin them. And if you use stocking cap pull it back away from hairline so you don‚Äôt see it in the front. Hope this helps ladies. Also here is my video üòâ https://youtu.be/8BzfjSc1RNs,4,0

GRDoasFyesU,"I've been married 16 years. I have a pretty good wife though we've had our problems. Here's why I don't recommend marriage for unmarried men now:\\nFirst, the stakes are incredibly high. The risk of failure is too high, unacceptably high. The odds of finding a suitable partner who can and will actually be in it for the long haul are too low.\\n\\nSecond, marriage for a man means mostly taking on duties and obligations. The offer was sweetened because in exchange for his taking on those obligations, the prospective husband was traditionally promised one real, valuable benefit: Good, regular sex at reasonable intervals with a reasonably attractive women, all with a minimum of effort. But even that's not guaranteed now because many wives do not consider they have any obligation to have sex with their husbands and feel justified in withholding sex for the flimsiest of reasons or no reason at all. And besides, a man who wants sex in this time need not marry to get it. All he needs is either (1) minimal game competence; or (2) money for prostitutes.\\n\\nSo, if he can't even get some minimal guarantee of the one benefit he's supposed to get out of the deal, why should he even try to make the deal in the first place?\\n\\nSorry this betrays some of my Christian beliefs. I'm just stating realities on the ground.\\n\\nWhile women certainly do have feelings, and they sometimes use the word 'love' to describe it- It depends on how we define love.... is it a passionate moment of powerful feeling... or is it a lifetime of commitment and sacrifice?",0,0

GRDoasFyesU,"It is quite dissapointing how noticable the lace is on a freedom couture wig.  I was going to save up money for one but the mesh is very spaced out and seems thick, and for that expensive of a wig, you expect to look more natural and seamless. Ive bought 300 dollar wigs with better up close lace than that.  There are ways around it.  I would look up videos to try and cover the mesh.. some people use got2b glue on the inside of the cap and let it dry to cover it up.  Personally I am a silk top girl and if I dont like the lace on the wig that is touching my scalp I put the wig a bit father back to almost see my hairline and I color it with brown eyeshadow powder.  Hard to explain but it looks a lot more natural.   You should also put Freedom Couture in your title so more people can see it.  I know I am glad to have found your video before purchasing.  Thank you for the honest review.  Your wig is workable though so don't worry!",1,0
GRDoasFyesU,From far away and on their Instagram account they made it look so easy and so pretty and natural af but in real life you can see everything,0,0
GRDoasFyesU,"How you cut and apply a wig depends on what you‚Äôre wearing it for. For everyday kind of use, you just trim back the lace as close to the baby hairs as you can. You secure the wig down by having a wig cap on, and using bobby pins to secure it in place. Under the wig cap you can do multiple things. You can do a wrap, you can do pin curls, you can do anything that holds the hair flat and gives your natural hair some shape or texture for the pins you put through the wig to grip on to. For stage, you‚Äôd leave the lace long (with repeated use the lace gets shitty and you have to trim it back. Eventually you run out of lace and you have to get it replaced) and use adhesive to stick the lace down around the face. Never put adhesive in the hair because that just ruins it. Sometimes the wigs natural hairline doesn‚Äôt match your own so you just kind of have to fiddle with it and find a way to disguise any lace that stands out. You can use makeup to cover it too",0,0

And when people start spewing non sense like this, it just rubs law abiding gun owners the wrong way. I would also like to urge people to look at Chicago as an example of what stricter gun laws looks like. They have an outrageous amount of shootings, yet some of the strictest gun laws in the country. The unfortunate reality is no matter what laws we make, the US will never become this magical place where nothing bad happens.

GRDoasFyesU,I specialize in making and showing how to lay wigs down to look natural. You shouldn‚Äôt have to pull any of your natural hair out while wearing Freedom wigs. And also make sure there is a elastic band sewn in so it for snug to the head. Lastly do two braids to the back of your head and pin them. And if you use stocking cap pull it back away from hairline so you don‚Äôt see it in the front. Hope this helps ladies. Also here is my video üòâ https://youtu.be/8BzfjSc1RNs,29,0

GRDoasFyesU,"How you cut and apply a wig depends on what you‚Äôre wearing it for. For everyday kind of use, you just trim back the lace as close to the baby hairs as you can. You secure the wig down by having a wig cap on, and using bobby pins to secure it in place. Under the wig cap you can do multiple things. You can do a wrap, you can do pin curls, you can do anything that holds the hair flat and gives your natural hair some shape or texture for the pins you put through the wig to grip on to. For stage, you‚Äôd leave the lace long (with repeated use the lace gets shitty and you have to trim it back. Eventually you run out of lace and you have to get it replaced) and use adhesive to stick the lace down around the face. Never put adhesive in the hair because that just ruins it. Sometimes the wigs natural hairline doesn‚Äôt match your own so you just kind of have to fiddle with it and find a way to disguise any lace that stands out. You can use makeup to cover it too",0,0

GRDoasFyesU,"As a black woman who occasionally wears lace front wigs, I agree - when I watched tutorials as a beginner, I realized there are SO MANY STEPS MISSING!! And omg she really used double-sided tape lmbooo poor thing, I'm dying!! lol I recommend getting some wig glue or toupee tape instead of regular double-sided tape (which will shine through). Also, for people with fair skin the lace should be bleached, so it's transparent. The lace on these wigs was like, light brown/tan lol tooo visible for their skin tone... hope it works out better next time :)",0,0

GRDoasFyesU,"I've been married 16 years. I have a pretty good wife though we've had our problems. Here's why I don't recommend marriage for unmarried men now:\\nFirst, the stakes are incredibly high. The risk of failure is too high, unacceptably high. The odds of finding a suitable partner who can and will actually be in it for the long haul are too low.\\n\\nSecond, marriage for a man means mostly taking on duties and obligations. The offer was sweetened because in exchange for his taking on those obligations, the prospective husband was traditionally promised one real, valuable benefit: Good, regular sex at reasonable intervals with a reasonably attractive women, all with a minimum of effort. But even that's not guaranteed now because many wives do not consider they have any obligation to have sex with their husbands and feel justified in withholding sex for the flimsiest of reasons or no reason at all. And besides, a man who wants sex in this time need not marry to get it. All he needs is either (1) minimal game competence; or (2) money for prostitutes.\\n\\nSo, if he can't even get some minimal guarantee of the one benefit he's supposed to get out of the deal, why should he even try to make the deal in the first place?\\n\\nSorry this betrays some of my Christian beliefs. I'm just stating realities on the ground.\\n\\nWhile women certainly do have feelings, and they sometimes use the word 'love' to describe it- It depends on how we define love.... is it a passionate moment of powerful feeling... or is it a lifetime of commitment and sacrifice?",0,0
GRDoasFyesU,"Stick with the Jon Renau, and Raquel Welch wigs. The lace front in these wigs are very realistic, no cutting lace as it's already cut.\\nGet hand tied as they're much better quality.",0,0

GRDoasFyesU,"To get rid of the spotty look you have to put powder foundation under the lace to help cancel out the dark lace roots. Try it next time, that should help. Also, you can cut the part around your ear to contour to the natural curve of your head. So don't be afraid to cut some lace and hair around your ears.",0,0

GRDoasFyesU,"It is quite dissapointing how noticable the lace is on a freedom couture wig.  I was going to save up money for one but the mesh is very spaced out and seems thick, and for that expensive of a wig, you expect to look more natural and seamless. Ive bought 300 dollar wigs with better up close lace than that.  There are ways around it.  I would look up videos to try and cover the mesh.. some people use got2b glue on the inside of the cap and let it dry to cover it up.  Personally I am a silk top girl and if I dont like the lace on the wig that is touching my scalp I put the wig a bit father back to almost see my hairline and I color it with brown eyeshadow powder.  Hard to explain but it looks a lot more natural.   You should also put Freedom Couture in your title so more people can see it.  I know I am glad to have found your video before purchasing.  Thank you for the honest review.  Your wig is workable though so don't worry!",1,0

You got some woman at a country music festival that has plenty of alcohol, screaming at a group of people You're all going to die!. \\nNobody seems to know the context of why she was saying that though. I've lived in trailer parks, that shit is not surprising to me at all. One drunk group of people get into it with another drunk group of people and stupid shit gets said. Doesn't anyone remember all the things \\nthat were reported on 9/11 that turned out to false information from a confused public? Like how helicopters had collided and a 3rd smaller plane hit another building? You have a guy who even his brother admits is wealthy. A local gun shop that confirmed he had purchased multiple\\n weapons from that shop. Weapons that can be broken down small enough to fit into a back pack and easily be reassembled. I hear the argument that no senior citizen could physically handle 10 minutes of sustained fire with an automatic weapon. Bullshit! Small children fight in wars, running from one position to another while laying down accurate fire with an ak-47 that weighs half as much as themselves. I think a 64 year old man can handle firing an automatic weapon from a fixed position. Especially with a bi-pod. People talking about how the shots were too accurate for someone who is untrained. Again, bullshit. It was 400 yards away! That's not that far when you're just shooting into a huge crowd of thousands of people. I think someone who is fluently proficient with an automatic weapon would have killed a lot more people. There were thousands of people grouped together. I think the fact that he didn't kill\\nmore people than he did is testament to how accurate he actually was. People insisting on multiple shooters. When you're being shot at you're going to hear 3 different sounds for every one bullet fired. The sound of the bullet impact, the crack of the bullet mid-air when it breaks the sound barrier, and the muzzle burst itself. Not to mention the echo from a gunshot at a distance. One automatic rifle CAN and DOES sound like multiple weapons being fired. \\nI can't claim to be certain of shit, and that's my point. The little information we have to go on is being turned into these grand conspiracy theories and that shit is dangerous. There are too many unstable people with guns who are too stupid to think this through and just react. \\nThe more false information circulated, the more you feed into that danger.",0,0

This week congress is going to vote on deregulating gun silencers and on allowing people in open carry states to open carry in non-open carry states. Call your senators and state reps and tell them to vote no on senate bill 446 today!,0,0

8rhb5wTCero,"Today I auditioned for my school musical, Mary Poppins. It was originally going to be something else but 2 weeks ago it was changed. I've always wanted to be in a school play, but I'd been too nervous to try out. This year I'd gotten it in my head that I was going to be in the school musical, it was my dream and I wasn't going to let my insecurities put it off any longer. So about a month ago I went up to my school's drama teacher and told her that while I can't really sing, I'd really like to get a minor role with minimal singing and she seemed happy to accommodate me. \\n\\nBut then the musical was switched to Mary Poppins, a movie I'd watched many many times as a child. Now I still thought I couldn't sing, but I really wanted to try so for two weeks I practiced Chim chim Cher-ee I didn't actually think I could land such a huge role as Bert, more realistically I wanted one of the chimney sweeps for Step in Time but I thought why not, I'll practice both and just choose one on the day of the audition. \\n\\nSo today was the day and I got it in my head that I would sing Chim chim Cher-ee. They called my name and I went into the classroom, away from the buzzing noise of my far more talented classmates. The drama teacher said she knew I didn't want to sing and to just read these lines as best I could. I wanted to say that I'd been practicing a song and I wanted to sing but with 3 teachers glaring at me I was too nervous so I just butchered the lines and left as fast as possible. The second I left, I regretted it. I wanted to sing, I wanted it so much so I decided I would just wait until everyone else had auditioned (so that I didn't interrupt) and go back in to ask if I could sing. And so I waited for about an hour, and at some point my mom had texted me asking how much longer would I be, but I didn't answer because I was worried she would think I was dumb for waiting around. Then my mom walks up to me in the hallway and start asking me why I didn't answer her text and how much longer would it be. I took her off to the side and explained what happened, but it took so long to explain by the time I was done auditions were over. So my mom goes straight into the room where they held auditions and tells the drama teacher but I really wanted to sing embarrassing the crap out of me. The teacher was so sweet about the misunderstanding and gave me a chance, but by this point I was so embarrassed and nervous that I was crying. I try to pull myself together as quickly as possible because I really wanted this. I started singing but because I just been crying I got choked up after the chorus and couldn't (I was really disappointed in myself because my favorite part of that song is the ending). The teachers were really supportive of me singing and had already cast me as a couple minor roles. \\n\\nI just feel so worthless and dumb because I couldn't to get the part of that song that I thought I was actually kind of good at. As soon as I got home I saw this video had been released, and I have never seen or heard a piece of art that so perfectly reflected how I was currently feeling. Even if the teachers weren't the ones to make me feel like I wasn't good enough, I I feel so dumb that I screwed up not once but twice and I just wish that someone could hear me sing for real.",0,0

There are plenty of other comments in the comments section to tell you that. What I am going to say is that it is okay. It is okay to feel like a 6/10 on certain days as long as you don't make it an everyday thing and make your mind completely believe that you are and will always be a 6/10 because you won't.  It is okay to feel like a 6/10 on some days but you also have to make sure that your mind knows that the real you is a 10/10 and the feeling of feeling 6/10 is just temporary.

If you want to have a weapon to defend yourself from break ins, muggings, etc. Then I really don't have a problem with that, but all you need is a pistol. And we need stricter back round checks. It's not rocket science. Everytime these things happen, people pretend to care for like a month, and nothing changes. Conservatives love to think they're all smart with their  if you take away our guns, then blah blah blah crap, but I don't see any of them actually trying to find a solution. If all you're going to do is shoot down ideas about gun control, let us hear how YOU would solve the problem.

The Ends of the World by Peter Brannen, about mass extinction, is another to read book on my list, but I've heard good things and was impressed by the author during one of his presentations. And as for another non-fiction dinosaur comic, Science Comics' Dinosaurs: Fossils and Feathers is another good choice that focuses more on the history of paleontology (although I did find a couple errors in the book.)",0,0

This year was recent history stuff.\\n\\nThe Assassin's Gate -Iraq war reporting and the politics behind the mess.\\n\\nFarewell Kabul - Christina Lamb's 20+ years experience reporting in AfPak region. Fascinating and great.\\n\\nThe Utility of Force - General Rupert Smith (it's my to read but looks super interesting)\\n\\nThe Bad Ass Librarians of Timbuktu - Joshua Hammer Oh along the curator lines...you'd love this. Just a holy shit*t read. \\n\\nSecondhand Time - Svetlana Alexievich \\nAbout the fall of the Soviet Union and different people's reactions to the 90's. It's a wild, emotional read. She states much of it in their own words, transcribed and it's utterly eye opening fascinating account of what the average Russian and the not so average Russian, as individuals, reacted to the changes.\\n\\nSpycatcher - Peter Wright About the development of MI-5's technology division in the 50's by the guy who led it. Super interesting and reflective of how we got to where we are with surveillance. Old, British, and lil Dry at times. Like a good wine, minus the British.\\n\\nLoved this episode though, would love to hear book recommendation from colleagues at the field museum.",0,0

tfZvSS_f254,Nice and good for you for doing this and Casey I do respect the hell out of you.  But we have heard this all before. A massacre happens. People say how saddened they are. They pray. They talk about how things could or should change. It‚Äôs in the news for a week.  They give money. They move on. Then the next one happens.  Being from Australia I‚Äôve visited your country numerous times and think it‚Äôs the best place on the planet to visit and have a genuine love for the people and the country. But there is an underlying disrespect most of the world hold for you and it‚Äôs this.  True action is standing up to your politicians and saying no more this has to stop. True action is saving the next potential victims of such a barbaric and insane action like we saw in a Vegas.  I‚Äôve read a few comments about true action from you on this platform saying to make a documentary about how the people could infect change. Now that would be amazing.,0,0

They ended up tying a rope from the turtle to a float to which they tied a weather balloon with a radio transmitter.

8Lv3tW7bWzU,I recommend A Primate's Memoir by Robert Sapolsky-- really good field biology focused nonfiction about baboons! Bring many tissues for the ending.,0,0
8Lv3tW7bWzU,"I love A Sting in the Tale by David Goulson, it's all about bees! He also wrote A Buzz in the Meadow which is amazing if you want to learn about bees AND bugs. If you wanna get into some fiction, Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer has some pretty wicked biology in it!",1,0

8Lv3tW7bWzU,"Sorry,   more recommendations because I love science writing. The Earth Remade by Oliver Morton is a good overview of geoengineering schemes to combat global warming. The Sixth Extinction by Elizabeth Kolbert has already been mentioned, but if anyone wants a older but longer read on the same topic, I recommend David Quammen's Song of the Dodo. The Ends of the World by Peter Brannen, about mass extinction, is another to read book on my list, but I've heard good things and was impressed by the author during one of his presentations. And as for another non-fiction dinosaur comic, Science Comics' Dinosaurs: Fossils and Feathers is another good choice that focuses more on the history of paleontology (although I did find a couple errors in the book.)",0,0
8Lv3tW7bWzU,"So good to have another set of book recommendations- I treated myself to a fair few from your last list. I've already got 'Smoke gets in your eyes' and I agree a collab with Caitlin would be awesome.

8Lv3tW7bWzU,I'd recommend Spillover! (By David Quammen). It's about all the different zoonotic diseases. It's sooooo good it's like a detective story trying to find out where they come from. If you're not keen on reading the whole thing (not that it's very long) he released an updated excerpt on Ebola after the 2014 episode which is also AMAZING. A couple of my non-science friends read the excerpt and loved it!,3,1

Maybe include them in one of the mom's view videos? If you dont mind. All in all, I love you so much mommytard. I hope the Almighty will keep on blessing you with sufficient strength to face all the challenges in life. You've been too kind and forgiving to the point where your husband thought no matter what he did, you wouldn't leave him. Thats why he took you for granted. Let's hope he won't repeat the most stupid mistake he's ever done in his entire life. Never underestimate the power of love and forgiveness. Be strong! And i love you.",0,0

8Lv3tW7bWzU,My last book was The Radium Girls: The Dark Story of America's Shining Women by Kate Moore.  While not heavy in the science area it talks about the radiation exposure the girls endured while painting the luminous dials on instruments.

8Lv3tW7bWzU,Read Archie Carr's The Windward Road and So Excellent A Fishe!! The Windward Road is about his field studies as a herpetologist in the Caribbean in the 40s and 50s. So Excellent A Fishe is about early sea turtle research and conservation. They are both really entertaining and insightful. I really enjoyed reading about the first time they put a tracker on a turtle in the 60s and the struggles they had to deal with. They ended up tying a rope from the turtle to a float to which they tied a weather balloon with a radio transmitter. Turned out the transmitter had such short range that they could see the balloon before they could tap in on the transmitter.,0,0

8Lv3tW7bWzU,I'd recommend Spillover! (By David Quammen). It's about all the different zoonotic diseases. It's sooooo good it's like a detective story trying to find out where they come from.

The Ends of the World by Peter Brannen, about mass extinction, is another to read book on my list, but I've heard good things and was impressed by the author during one of his presentations.

Goes without saying‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt take more than recommended amount of laxative or any other over the counter drug.\\n2. Timescale‚Äôs a bit unclear, as is case with most patient reports.\\n3. 2:25 Calf muscle is a prominent area of muscle pain in this condition.\\n4. 3:38 Potassium is scarce extracellularly compared to sodium. It‚Äôs the principal intracellular cation.\\n5. 3:51 ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt you talk about calcium in muscle contraction?‚Äù Because the rabbit hole will go too far in and I got into a version of the video that became a clinical lecture. Original draft of this video was 35 minutes long, given the nature of what happens with kidneys and calcium.\\n6. 4:30 More than just potassium is given. It‚Äôs the 3rd or 4th in sequence I believe. \\n7. 4:45 this is a type of ventricular tachycardia (ventricle = chamber of the heart, tachy = fast, cardia = heart rate) called torsades de pointes. It‚Äôs lethal, usually arises from QT prolongation. For hypochondriacs out there, you probably don‚Äôt have it right now.\\n8. 5:36 Another rabbit hole. Actually calcium is allowed in too, leads to more muscle contraction, and calcium deposits in tissue which appear in imaging. Hypocalcemia then leads to higher phosphate levels, increasing bone resorption, breaking bones, damaging kidneys, etc. This part of the video could go on for hours.\\n9. 6:09 Think about 6 2L bottles of soda swelling up in your muscles. That‚Äôs a lot of water.\\n10. 6:30 If you want to know more about this, there‚Äôs hormones at play here, but medicines can also constrict afferent and efferent arterioles.\\n11. 8:12 The real BG did have myoglobinuria.\\n12. 8:45 That‚Äôs a bottle of lactic acid. Same thing that makes your muscles sore after exercise. Since muscle is breaking down, it spills into blood, releasing H+ causing acidosis.\\n13. 9:15 Sorry music is loud‚Ä¶\\n14. 11:20 What would we give him for metabolic acidosis? Comment below :)\\n15.

The reason the wolf ran in the woods at the end is because he knew he might of nearly got squished by the beeping truck! And, doesn't it look to small to be a wolf? Well, just cruel... recording an animal nearly getting hit by a car? If you stopped someone would've came flying and hit the wolf... but, after all these facts it looks like a domesticated husky/ wolfdog. A wolf would be to shy to chase after a car like that.

Only a select few dogs can maintain that speed with just over a gallop, none of which are the same size as a wolf, larger or smaller. The geographic area supports the claim of it being a wolf. What's more, I know of no domestic dog breed with a coat patern like this nor do I know of any with a straight bushy tail or a coat of fur that thick. If anything, this COULD be a wolf/dog hybrid but I am 90% certain this a wild Canadian Grey Wolf.",1,1

bpDylTwwunc,"Okay, so, somebody needs to explain this to me. It's illegal to do drugs, right? It's illegal to be in possession of drugs, right? In order to be a drug addict, you must use drugs, and to use drugs, you must be in possession of them, right? So, why do we reward drug addicts with a 4 star rehabilitation resort and let them continue on with thier lives? Saying your a drug addict is like saying you murdered somebody, or you robbed a bank. It's a crime, it happened past tense, no one saw you commit the crime, there is no evidence, that doesn't mean it didn't happen. And 100 percent of the time, going into rehab, people can fail a drug test. So why is there no legal punishment for this? Why are they not getting sober in prison? Why do you get 25 years for just being in possession of a brick of coke but admitting to possessing and using drugs gets you...nothing. I love demi, but she should have been in prison. I beleive in all or nothing, either drugs are illegal, or they arent. There is no in between. An addict can't give you a sob story and get away with a major crime. Either it's okay for them and everyone else to use drugs, or its not. This is why it's such a problem. We're teaching our kids they can do drugs, and when they're done, they just go to rehab and get thier life back with zero consequences. Am I missing something? Can somebody please point out where I went wrong with my logic?",0,0

CrwmpuwLBiI,"I liked the part where Kylo Ren tells Rey, Wow you are The Last Jedi. Sorry I killed your dad, Luke Skywalker.",511,30
CrwmpuwLBiI,"I looked up that thing on Kylo Ren's face. It's a skin bandage. It's applied over the scar, keeps the skin together, so the scar can heal. It's a futuristic band aid, basically. He pulls it off later, and you can see the scar healed in the last frame of the trailer. It's not under his skin or flesh. So relax! I hope that helps.",3,0
CrwmpuwLBiI,Kylo's scar is awesome. I think of it as part of this recurring thing where being sith = becoming a cyborg. But he's this kinda young modern sith with nice hair so instead of getting an iron lung suit or robot spider legs he's got this kind of low-key brillo-patch on his ronin face cut.,0,0

You were feeding him/her weren't you? You're even lucky to see a wolf! They are nearly extinct! Anddd you were leading in in the middle of the road, the poor wolf could've got hit by a car! It was obviously not chasing anything, it was trying to tell you something. They're extremely intelligent! The reason the wolf ran in the woods at the end is because he knew he might of nearly got squished by the beeping truck! And, doesn't it look to small to be a wolf? Well, just cruel... recording an animal nearly getting hit by a car? If you stopped someone would've came flying and hit the wolf... but, after all these facts it looks like a domesticated husky/ wolfdog. A wolf would be to shy to chase after a car like that. I would've stopped to check. Wolves don't attack people so, no worries. It sure looked like a wolf dog. It was probably dumbed, wanted food, water, and a home.

What's more, I know of no domestic dog breed with a coat patern like this nor do I know of any with a straight bushy tail or a coat of fur that thick.

CrwmpuwLBiI,"The Mesh Thing as you call it, is most likely a Bacta (Star Wars Magic Medicine) patch used for healing wounds on the go, since this movie is supposed to take place right after the last one according to the director. I'm guessing he is feeling like a failure after his loss to Rey and wants to get right back out there in the fight and slaps it on his face instead of going home to lick his wounds for a while. Then by the end of the film, it will come off. Think future face grow back bandaid.",0,0

2HcqS508lIo,Relying on a round to complete the electrical circuit is a fatal flaw.  The rail gun will always have very severe barrel wear.   Now if only we could use a mass driver (linear motor)(ungoverned meglev track) or Gauss gun (coil gun) (Stacked stator rings) you could avoid friction with the barrel sides all together.  Both of these frictionless guns are far more complex to engineer and miniaturize.,0,0

Videos will never fill the void inside of you, but Jesus will if you give your life to Him. He will love you, keep you company, and answer your questions. He is real and a lot of the time He will speak to you through your conscience. God is love and everything good comes from Him. Everything good in the world comes from love. Romantic love, familial love, friendship, the love you feel for your hobbies, the love you have for your favorite music, favorite food, favorite movie, etc. All of it comes from God. Without love there is no point to life. It is what we all live for and it is what we were all made for, but the devil tries to ruin everything with fear, stress, worry, etc. Try to get to know God. He is truly worth worshipping.",0,0

xEqCt7GZo7M,"To simulate a 1g load you need to at least include the weight of the hull as well. Everything but the wing basically and that's under the problematic assumption that loads are shared evenly.\\nTypical engineering might have a factor 2 strength margin and that's static loads. so if you only loaded it near 2 that means you are in jeopardy even in the calmest level flight, let alone pulling g's. \\nI recommend you strain it to at least 5g load and your first flight should ideally be remote controlled with a dummy load in or do it on a long smooth runway and only fly just above the surface so you can survive a total failure. Then you can test quick pulses of 4-5g pull and see if it explodes.",0,2

MiFeES9uOSo,"Jesus loves you. If you repent of your sins and give your life to Him: He will fill you with love, give you happiness in your life, and bless you. The next time that you feel sick or worried or scared, ask Jesus into your heart and your life will get better. Videos will never fill the void inside of you, but Jesus will if you give your life to Him. He will love you, keep you company, and answer your questions. He is real and a lot of the time He will speak to you through your conscience. God is love and everything good comes from Him. Everything good in the world comes from love. Romantic love, familial love, friendship, the love you feel for your hobbies, the love you have for your favorite music, favorite food, favorite movie, etc. All of it comes from God. Without love there is no point to life. It is what we all live for and it is what we were all made for, but the devil tries to ruin everything with fear, stress, worry, etc. Try to get to know God. He is truly worth worshipping.",0,0

As you said in an earlier video that you are gonna use 4 30000mah 6s lipo's, you could use two batteries for each motor in series, and make a proper voltage monitoring and alarm system. How do you plan on making the throttle stick? I guess it have to be a potmeter with a converter to get the PWM signal to the ESC, and here you could make a seperate system as well, with two potmeters and two converters on the same mechanical stick. With two seperate systems you get no single point that can fail and cut both motors. \\nGood luck and have fun! Looking forward to seeing it fly.",0,0

xEqCt7GZo7M,"Hey there, I've been flying since I was fourteen, hang gliders, ultralights, general aviation singles and twins, also an AP mechanic with an Inspection Authorization or IA. I'm 57 now and still just as crazy, about being safe ha ha though some of my friends think I'm crazy, from what I've seen of the build it looks good, I especially like the wire cut foam for the wings. As far as the nylock style fasteners they are not a problem, been flying the same ultralight for twenty seven years, it's now an experimental light sport category aircraft, and I use these fasteners exclusively because there cheap and the don't come off on their own, I use a three times on three times off and toss them out or if you can't turn them on to the bolt by hand through the plastic lock ring, there fine. As for vibration, well if you can see the instrument panel you'll be ok, but if it's shaking so bad that you can't, obviously   there's something amiss.\\n\\n  Never have needed any thead lock unless its engine related or a critical airframe component the requires its use. \\n\\nOnly on my rc helos, I use that stuff on or my other flying projects, like full size helicopter and gyrocopter.\\n\\n Just be aware that flying an ultralight is no different than flying a full-size aircraft. When your butt is in the pilots seat, you can't just shake it off and tape up your busted what ever. Not to be morbib but I've lost friends over the years because of lack of training, maintenance, of just saying hey watch this. It usually does not end well.\\n\\nGood rule of thumb is make up a test plan.\\nAC90-89B pertains to amateur‚Äã and ultralight flight testing.\\nWeight and Balance (this is so important, if it not correct the plane may not lift off at all or on the other hand may take off with out any warning and become completely uncontrolable, this little detail can at best wreck the plane and scab you up or at worst destroy the craft and kill you). You really need to know the numbers for the airfoil and especially for a biplane arrangement, and if their offset from each other. \\n\\nGround handling\\nTaxi testing / including fast taxis to discover low speed behavior prior to lift off. \\netc.\\nAlways test on a windless day. Early morning or evening around here.\\nPerform short hops first. Don't try to force the machine to fly.\\nThere are lots of other tidbits so read what all you can. And get training even if your already a pilot. I've watched an airline pilot test fly an ultralight and had an engine out situation. Not realizing he could have made the field he opted to drop into a field of berries all supported by 6x6 posts and heavy wire rope. Cost him his career and six months in the hospital  and therapy for a year.  It almost cost him his life. Seatbelt dam near cut him in two.\\n\\nMy favorite is: Maintain thy airspeed, least thee ground rise up and smite thee.\\n If you have questions I'd be willing to answer any you may have.\\n\\nSafety is no accident.\\n\\nBrad.",1,0

Videos will never fill the void inside of you, but Jesus will if you give your life to Him. He will love you, keep you company, and answer your questions. He is real and a lot of the time He will speak to you through your conscience. God is love and everything good comes from Him. Everything good in the world comes from love. Romantic love, familial love, friendship, the love you feel for your hobbies, the love you have for your favorite music, favorite food, favorite movie, etc. All of it comes from God. Without love there is no point to life. It is what we all live for and it is what we were all made for, but the devil tries to ruin everything with fear, stress, worry, etc. Try to get to know God.

xEqCt7GZo7M,"Hey there, I've been flying since I was fourteen, hang gliders, ultralights, general aviation singles and twins, also an AP mechanic with an Inspection Authorization or IA. I'm 57 now and still just as crazy, about being safe ha ha though some of my friends think I'm crazy, from what I've seen of the build it looks good, I especially like the wire cut foam for the wings. As far as the nylock style fasteners they are not a problem, been flying the same ultralight for twenty seven years, it's now an experimental light sport category aircraft, and I use these fasteners exclusively because there cheap and the don't come off on their own, I use a three times on three times off and toss them out or if you can't turn them on to the bolt by hand through the plastic lock ring, there fine. As for vibration, well if you can see the instrument panel you'll be ok, but if it's shaking so bad that you can't, obviously   there's something amiss.\\n\\n  Never have needed any thead lock unless its engine related or a critical airframe component the requires its use. \\n\\nOnly on my rc helos, I use that stuff on or my other flying projects, like full size helicopter and gyrocopter.\\n\\n Just be aware that flying an ultralight is no different than flying a full-size aircraft. When your butt is in the pilots seat, you can't just shake it off and tape up your busted what ever. Not to be morbib but I've lost friends over the years because of lack of training, maintenance, of just saying hey watch this. It usually does not end well.\\n\\nGood rule of thumb is make up a test plan.\\nAC90-89B pertains to amateur‚Äã and ultralight flight testing.\\nWeight and Balance (this is so important, if it not correct the plane may not lift off at all or on the other hand may take off with out any warning and become completely uncontrolable, this little detail can at best wreck the plane and scab you up or at worst destroy the craft and kill you). You really need to know the numbers for the airfoil and especially for a biplane arrangement, and if their offset from each other. \\n\\nGround handling\\nTaxi testing / including fast taxis to discover low speed behavior prior to lift off. \\netc.\\nAlways test on a windless day. Early morning or evening around here.\\nPerform short hops first. Don't try to force the machine to fly.\\nThere are lots of other tidbits so read what all you can. And get training even if your already a pilot. I've watched an airline pilot test fly an ultralight and had an engine out situation. Not realizing he could have made the field he opted to drop into a field of berries all supported by 6x6 posts and heavy wire rope. Cost him his career and six months in the hospital  and therapy for a year.  It almost cost him his life. Seatbelt dam near cut him in two.\\n\\nMy favorite is: Maintain thy airspeed, least thee ground rise up and smite thee.\\n If you have questions I'd be willing to answer any you may have.\\n\\nSafety is no accident.\\n\\nBrad.",4,0
xEqCt7GZo7M,What if you fly it to flight test?,0,0
xEqCt7GZo7M,"One suggestion may be to add four more cables in an  X  formation from the bottom cable connection points at fuselage to the upper wing towards the furthest current connection points, on either side, if they can manage the angle of pull. Doing this should help keep from too much wing twist in flight. Also look up something called earoelastic flutter. Given a low thrust to lift ratio (not going faster than the airfoil is intended structurally), this should be less likely but there are still other variables that could factor in.",0,0

See these videos https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1C878703713C6699 of an ultralight biplane we built over thirty years ago. Included is a photo of our static loading test (to -5G), we had 2160 lbs on the wings and we did separate tests for the tail feathers. We loaded the airplane in negative G because that was worse case for our structure. One thing you should be doing during the load tests is to observe that the structure returns to the same place it started when you remove the weight, otherwise it's telling you that you bent something. Nobody wants to see you get hurt.",1,0

As you said in an earlier video that you are gonna use 4 30000mah 6s lipo's, you could use two batteries for each motor in series, and make a proper voltage monitoring and alarm system. How do you plan on making the throttle stick? I guess it have to be a potmeter with a converter to get the PWM signal to the ESC, and here you could make a seperate system as well, with two potmeters and two converters on the same mechanical stick. With two seperate systems you get no single point that can fail and cut both motors. \\nGood luck and have fun! Looking forward to seeing it fly.",0,0

I was an absolutely obsessed Potter fan back in the early 2000s.  mugglenet and the-leaky-cauldron.org were all I visited and I could not get enough.  I ended up losing touch , and  I boycotted Fantastic Beasts after The Cursed Child because I was so disappointed in the script.  It did not feel on point or even relevant to the Harry Potter universe.  I finally watched Fantastic Beasts and I was blown away last March, and since then I have become obsessed with Harry Potter theories on YouTube.

K19NG3mNhKk,I don't even watch Harry Potter but I had to watch this epic collab :D :D,0,0
K19NG3mNhKk,"Slytherins are known to be cunning and ambitious. Therefore, shouldn't the locket also give the wearer greater abilities to convince someone else of something? Or help them to trick someone else? I think the locket gives magically increased persuasiveness. This could also tie into the locket's self-defense mechanism after it becomes a horcrux. It tries to convince/trick Ron into not killing it by showing him imagery of Harry and Hermione together. I also think that the locket gives the wearer a greater ability to meet their own personal goals when it is being worn (the ambition part of the Slytherin mission statement). This could tie into how Mrs. Gaunt (Tom Riddle's mom) was able to learn magic despite not attending Hogwarts and how Umbridge was able to cast a Potronus in the Deathly Hallows. Finally, to tie into Slytherin's pure bloodedness craze, the locket could simply just work best when a) it is worn by someone of pure blood or b) against someone who is not a pure blood. And in addition of that, I also agree that the locket contains the knowledge of the Chamber of Secrets for the Heirs of Slytherin as discussed in the video.",0,0
K19NG3mNhKk,This is number 12 on trending well done,0,0
K19NG3mNhKk,"Well if the diary possessed Ginny with the piece of Voldemort's soul in order for her to speak parcel mouth and open the chamber, couldn't umbridge have been unwittingly possessed into speaking to the locket in order to unlock its power and gain the knowledge?",0,0

K19NG3mNhKk,"So this is kind of unrelated but I was thinking about one of the songs the sorting hat sang and a certain verse that said, And Hufflepuff took the rest after the Sorting Hat had explained what qualities were ideal for each other house. I know I lot of people used to think that the verse meant that Hufflepuffs had no redeeming qualities but I think people just read it wrong. I don't think it was referring to all Hufflepuffs as just the rest I think it was just saying that Helga Hufflepuff was so kind and accepting that she didn't care who you were, you could be in her house. So yeah, I always thought it was talking about Helga herself not the students, sorry for the rant lol",0,0
K19NG3mNhKk,OMG!! You guys are number 12 on trending! You totally deserve it; I have been watching this channel for years!,0,0
K19NG3mNhKk,I think it‚Äôs totally possible that Slytherin‚Äôs Locket enhances the ‚ÄúSlytherin‚Äù qualities of the wearer. It would also have this effect most strongly on pure blooded wizards which would help explain why Ron was most impacted by the locket.,0,0

I think the list of virtues that can be corrupted can be summarized as all of them.\\n\\nRavenclaw is seeking knowledge. That is common enough trope on its own, an evil researcher, doing horrible experiments and finding truths and knowledge regardless of the ethical dilemmas, heedless of good and evil.\\n\\nCaptain Ahab was obsessed with finding something. Being good at making friends is how cults gain power. Gilderoy Lockhart was outright evil. It would be a life sentence crime to memory wipe people without their consent, even ignoring taking their stories and stealing them. He was about to do it to two children, including the boy who lived. He was a ravenclaw.\\n\\nI have loved Harry Potter for years but one of the things that bother me about it is how clean and bias-conforming it can be. How easy the distinction between good and evil, how safe you can sometimes feel being awful if you avoid a certain action or group. That's how real evil groups feel morally righteous.\\n\\nWhich, I can love the story despite all of that. It just makes me sad to know that many fans can take this idealized and naive world view to heart.",0,0

Videos will never fill the void inside of you, but Jesus will if you give your life to Him. He will love you, keep you company, and answer your questions. He is real and a lot of the time He will speak to you through your conscience. God is love and everything good comes from Him. Everything good in the world comes from love. Romantic love, familial love, friendship, the love you feel for your hobbies, the love you have for your favorite music, favorite food, favorite movie, etc. All of it comes from God. Without love there is no point to life. It is what we all live for and it is what we were all made for, but the devil tries to ruin everything with fear, stress, worry, etc. Try to get to know God.

K19NG3mNhKk,Seamus looks so much hotter with that hair style.,0,0
K19NG3mNhKk,"One flaw with the knowledge being in the locket. Tom was raised in an orphanage and (correct me if I'm wrong) never visited the Gaunt house until after he graduated from Hogwarts. So it stands to reason that he wouldn't have gotten the locket until then unless his mother left it with him as a baby. But him finding that locket as an adult would make sense as to why he started working for Borgin and Burke's to find other artifacts from the houses. I might have some things wrong. I last read the books a few years ago.  EDIT: Actually Tom first got the locket from Borgin and Burkes after he started working there after graduating. The Chamber's location might have been in the locket, but he could have found out the location from his father when he murdered him the year before the Chamber was opened.",0,0

K19NG3mNhKk,"I'd assume Hufflepuff's cup would have all the obvious food charms; summon food from the kitchens, increase the quantity of foods though mainly liquids id assume, it is a cup after all and the vinegar into wine thing. Maybe wine into vinegar too? After all it's unlikely first years would get their hands in it but id assume responsible Hufflepuff wouldn't want them to have access to limitless alcohol. But to do that i suppose the cup would have to be able to tell someone's age which is a whole different thing.",0,0
K19NG3mNhKk,"I think the locket enhances the powers of those with pure blood but dampens the powers of those with mixed or muggle blood.  Furthermore I think the horcrux influenced the emotions of the wearer; making their moods much darker.

K19NG3mNhKk,"But guys, HOW DID RIDDLE OPEN THE CHAMBER WHILE AT SCHOOL THEN? He didn't get the locket until he LEFT school, and got the job at Borgin and Burkes. I do think it would make sense for Slytherin to put his knowledge inside it though - he does seem the type to want to pass his legacy on for centuries. (THE MAN BUILT A GIANT NETWORK OF TUNNELS AND PUT A BASILISK IN A CHAMBER IN WHICH HE ALSO PLACED A STATUE OF HIMSELF, HE WAS A PETTY MOTHERFUCKER, AND HE IS ME AF)\\nI'm a mix of Hufflepuff and Slytherin, a big mix of contradictions.",0,0

K19NG3mNhKk,"Fun vinegar/wine bit: when wine is incorrectly stored, it turns to vinegar. This process occurs by the wine being exposed to oxygen for a prolonged period of time.\\nThe cup (if it's power was to turn vinegar into wine) would just be correcting the vinegar, in a way, so that it becomes wine. Now, that isn't to say this is how all wine is made but it is a way. So it turning all vinegar into wine is impressive, but could still be the connection?",1,0
