AHrCI9eSJGQ,This was truly SPECTACULAR. Actually one of the most beautiful videos I've ever seen. The night time of the universe was truly awe inspiring. Makes one realize truly how small we are; a good thing to remember when one has problems they feel are overwhelming. Take ten minutes to watch this and it puts life and its problems and situations quickly in their proper order. Meaning not that important at all. My wife and I love your videos.

AHrCI9eSJGQ,Utube filled so many depressing and disturbing videos.... Loved this...Thanxx 4 getting up at 4am to capture those beautiful sunrises... I seriously wanna get into the details of ur work and knw more abt this video.. Like ur cameras/the seaexpedition/how u go into tat cargo ship... Evrything i wanna know frm scratch.... Not bcauz i wanna take pics/videos BUT EMBARK ON TAT JOURNEY... This my biggest dream..#SeaFarer...and there is a huge person relation of mine with this beautiful mystic miraculous mesmerizing sea... Inshort itz like this: Unlike mine and my father's generation my ancestors are true fishermen and sea farers... By birth and growth i belong to fishermen Jati...but vth modernity and development creeping in... I can no longer associate to tat Identity of my ancestors vhr my father works in an insurance sector and i one foot in academics and the other carving my own path of career...  All tat remains is jus to fascinate abt it... But still my ancestor's blood flows in me and no wonder i just love those moments vhn i take a walk on those sandy beaches of the ocean / rocky terrains of river beds/ lakebeds.... That sight at those pristine waters in its all blue... Tat gushing moisturised wind bathing my face and blowing my hair...JUST LOVE TAT...even now i stare at tat vision vth the wonder and curiosity of a child... Its like i am completely zapped by tat moment... Only on these occasions i love for the person i am and thngs i do...as i feel tat nothingness vhn i face a sea and tat innocence of a child like creeps into me... Those waves of water itz just like purging me.. The rest of the time i jus shun thyself...  So i immensely love boat rides... Seas.. Oceans...as of now my love and passion for this is only allowed and encouraged to those tiny 15-20mins boat rides/long walks near the lakes... But vhn my responsibilities r ovr...SeaFaring is all i yearn.... Awww man luk at those thousands of stars and tat beautiful play of colours on the night sky and tat music of water waves... Those highs and lows of the waves approaching the ship... The carefree drifting clouds... Those gentle/rough winds... Those rainwaters... And tat eternal like silence.... My existence is reduced to a tiny speck of dot in front of this beautiful creation... I feel so little and humbled... Wish ppl around me understand this,0,0

But I have one question, you think it would be possible to get a pic of the deck plans of the ship? I got this game where I build stuff in (Minecraft if you know about it ) and I've done quite a lot of ships in the past, so it would be so cool to see the layout of all the rooms and such in the ship :)",0,0

AHrCI9eSJGQ,"I am speechless. This was fascinating, awesome and yet sobering at the same time. The beauty of the ocean is awesome The loneliness of the long days at sea is sobering. That is one of the best YouTube videos I have seen in years. It does make you feel a bit small and insignificant when you put the world's oceans in perspective. I think this helps people understand the vastness of the water on this plant. I am afraid that people forget about the importance of the oceans until they make the news. On the other hand people will say there is so much ocean why should we be concerned. The night shots were beautiful. I would find myself standing out at night craning my neck to watch the universe go by. \\n\\nThough I have to say one of the thoughts that kept coming to mind was:  does it get lonely being out at sea for so long? What is the longest you have spent at sea during one stretch? How do you keep busy when not on shift? One stupid question does the ship ever become empty of containers? I actually have about a thousand other questions but that will do for now. Last thing please post more this was wonderful. I have watched it three times so far.",0,0

xA70bP5uzao,"(((Homosexuality is an abomination before a Holy God. If they dont repent and stop doing this sinful act they will not inherit the kingdom of God. Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \\nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\\n\\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\\n\\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\\n\\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\\n\\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\\n\\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\\n\\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\\n\\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\\n\\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\\n\\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\\n\\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\\n\\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\\n\\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \\n\\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\\n\\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",0,1

EVp4-qjWVJE,Man on that int. Fowler is held up as soon as he turns back. I fully understand the within 5 yards rule. But defensive player just grabs his jersey and hangs on. Total missed call. Also broncos need to play with their foot on the gas. If the did this wouldnt of been as close. Just fighting against the clock the whole last 1/3 of the game.,0,0

AHrCI9eSJGQ,"Jeff. 2 comments - i make videos a lot and these 2 suggestions would have made this video SO much better. Its a great time lapse  - totally compelling and the music is great. Comment 1: Don't use a full color watermark. If you're gonna use a water mark - white only, 50% opacity in the lower right hand corner. DON'T use the youtube logo unless you work for youtube. Comment 2: your commentary is distracting. My guess is you could get away with not using a lot for example don't comment on obvious things like the weather, we can see the weather, its obvious there are thunderstorms or rain or deck lighting. PLEASE no emoticons, icons, flags, colored text. Keep it simple.  Great work! But remember - the more you add, the less professional the video looks.  cheers.",0,0

z5eG8fD-hQw,"Dumb Lump Hughley, You may not be a racist but you sure like to stereotype white people. All your points are one sided.   Lets make this one point for all dumb ass liberals who live in their own reality.  On many sides regarding Charlottesville was meant to describe the violence that took place.  Trump separated the moral stance of white supremasts and denounced them as its own entity of the situation. So the lumping of the morals of white supremasts and alt left never actually took place as you want to portray it.    The violence was what was lumped. It was initiated by the alt left and Antifa.  They showed up with the intention of breaking the law and inciting violence. The white supremast group came with their own weapons, not to incite violence but to meet it head on.  As a result an innocent peaceful protester got caught in the middle and was killed.  On many sides is a statement of fact.  I'm a white man and I'm fed up with the hatred of what I stand for.  According to your ideology, I shouldn't be allowed to be proud of being a white male.  You want me to be ashamed of it. You expect me to bow down to this stupidity.   I think we should all be treated equally with opportunities, respect and dignity but in no way am I going to be ashamed of anything that I never had any control of in the past.  This causes many white men to be forced into firing back with their own hatred of what you represent including the forgiveness of those looting of our property and assaulting us during natural disasters.

Nobody can tell me different, the president said he missed the good ole days when black people protest when we were beat, imprisoned and lynched, I can go on but why bother. Certain things will be embeded in my mind and certain things will be looked over because the truth is too much too bare.  Watch the 13th on Netflix",0,0

Think of it as the concept cars that manufacturers show except Apple is capitalizing on that saying let's get even more money from the people dumb enough to buy it. And yes it's really expensive. I wouldn't personally buy it. And I don't even need to upgrade from the 7 I have which runs great.",0,0

(: And good reference to +Roth Cornet and your aunt. @ScreenJunkies News ,please use some combination of this group more often, please. 'Stranger Things' season 5 set in the late 1990's would be a total trip!! (good references everyone! please give us more shows like this one) drinking Surge (cola) reminded me of a late 90's beverage that made a come back this year... my favorite, the totally amazing Crystal (clear) Pepsi!!! and I still have my Jnco jeans (the straight leg jeans,not the big flair leg ones, of course they don't fit anymore) and shorts (I also had a pair of knockoff Jnco shorts in the 90's and wore them till they fell apart,lol). After superhero movies go into full decline, both horror movies, romcom and/or action/comedy (like from the 90's) movies need to make a comeback (points to both @Billy Business & @Joe Starr for saying that).We need more vampire stuff, now.(hehe) @SpencerJGilbert has the best idea, bring back the mid-budget stand alone movie, which can be in several genres (but saying the studio system was starting to get rolling in the 1970's.. is way off base. The true height of the studio system started in the middle 1920's with exclusive contracts for actors and directors,with the heads and executives of the major Hollywood studios' wielding enormous personal,creative and financial power). There is definitely a ton of rebooted Steven King movies comming, though I wish they would not do 'Christine' and some of the one's that we have already seen. @DanMurrell you are a producer here, make suggestions for a few select classic movies (and maybe Star Trek: The Next Generation) on +Honest Trailers. And good first job, but sorry about the triggering Christmas music. @Joe Starr ,feel for you man. My first big job was at K-Mart.. so the musak was totally inoffensive (but not the customers).

z5eG8fD-hQw,"Dumb Lump Hughley, You may not be a racist but you sure like to stereotype white people. All your points are one sided.   Lets make this one point for all dumb ass liberals who live in their own reality.  On many sides regarding Charlottesville was meant to describe the violence that took place.  Trump separated the moral stance of white supremasts and denounced them as its own entity of the situation. So the lumping of the morals of white supremasts and alt left never actually took place as you want to portray it.    The violence was what was lumped. It was initiated by the alt left and Antifa.  They showed up with the intention of breaking the law and inciting violence. The white supremast group came with their own weapons, not to incite violence but to meet it head on.  As a result an innocent peaceful protester got caught in the middle and was killed.  On many sides is a statement of fact.  I'm a white man and I'm fed up with the hatred of what I stand for.  According to your ideology, I shouldn't be allowed to be proud of being a white male.  You want me to be ashamed of it. You expect me to bow down to this stupidity.   I think we should all be treated equally with opportunities, respect and dignity but in no way am I going to be ashamed of anything that I never had any control of in the past.  This causes many white men to be forced into firing back with their own hatred of what you represent including the forgiveness of those looting of our property and assaulting us during natural disasters.   Your hate causes an equal and opposite hate. In some cases it causes a much deeper hate.",0,0

He his not gonna be impeached or anythi g like that so why dont these people who are constantly talking about the president use their public platform to try to bring people together in a peacfull and productive way? Has he done or said some racist things? Probably but most people have at 1 time or another. I do not believe the majority of U.S. Citizens are not racist and if he realy tried to blatantly pull some real racist shit we the peoplewould not stand for it. This motherfucker will only be in power a couple years. Instead of attacking him my fellow americans i say pressure your local officials to oppose any bills you dont like. Fucking congress and the senate are supposed to do OUR bidding. We cry that this is not fair or thats not fair... Want some good advice? STOP ELECTING THE SAME ASSHOLES WHO DONT DO SHIT TO HELP AND REPRESENT WE THE PEOPLE. We as american citizens need to take control of our nation once again. Its about the people remember? Our tax dollars get squandered. 99% of our elected officials dont give 2 shits about the PEOPLE who elect them.

It sadden me to witness this president line himself with people that do not care about all Americans.

For which it's written In the Holy Scriptures.( The Holy Bible ) A Nation that fights within the nation is a doomed nation ! If the tribes of Isreal ,as well as the 'gentiles''(all other nationalities), will be ripped out of the land ! Do you see the floods in all continents in different provinces ! Our Father God of Isreal curses as a punishment to the sinners who refuse to accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior !Out of Pure love , this message a warning to many of you, who walk in sin ! Turn your hearts and lives !, Confess with your mouths that Jesus is Lord and Savior! Pray to be forgiven ! Doing so you will become a full Christian , but you must then afterward stay loyal and keep the Law which was given to Moses! Its Written in Exodus ! Stay Loyal to the true living God Of Isreal till the end ! Glorify his Holy name with a honest and innocent heart joyfully ! It's written those who trust in the Lord, are truly happy ,In book of psalms! By keeping loyal in full reverence !, to our Lord Jesus Christ ,the son of man .Who is the light, the truth and the way to enter the Holy Kingdom of heaven. To inheriting eternal life ! The time is at hand !, decide now !,for love and peace and all happiness in a abundance of these blessings ,you need to obey Our Lord Jesus Christ and Our God Jahova of Isreal ! The second coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, will come like a thief at night! It's written ! It will happen ! For no man know the hour or the day ! Fear of the Lord Jesus Christ , the Judge of Judges who knows all hearts!He has the keys to the kingdom of heaven .Those that will inherit eternal life, in the Kingdom of Heaven are faithful and loyal keeping all the law in the Holy Bible ! Those that will be saved are being blessed according to their righteousness ! And The ones who are being cursed are the sinners who don't change their hearts. Turning from their sinful ways ! Just because you clame your a Christian but you are not keeping the Ten Commandments ! , you are certainly not saved !  Believe and become a  Christian in a prayer of forgiveness ,to our Father God Jahova ! , Ending the prayer in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ Amen!  The sinners will be caught off guard when Jesus Christ returns at that  unexpected time. Our God will slowly curse the rebellious by famine ; disease as a punishment till you realize you are rebelling against our God ! But if God says enough in his Just Judgment on a sinner and takes away such a persons opportunity to inherit the promises .will be cursed to eternal hell; second death of condemnation.Our Father the creator is a just God !He not Just about peace and love ! For which it's written ! But also a God of Justice ! \\nIt's not of Gods will , that man shall parish in the destruction !ex. In Book of John Chapter 3 verse 16 ! For God So loved the earth , that he gave his only begotten son , for those that believe in him , shall not parish in the destruction but have eternal life. Be of God cheer this is actually good news ! It's god's mercy that he'd loved to show you ! And bless you abundantly ! But ignoring our Gods offer to live according to your own will , Its a warning to all man and women in all nations. These are the end days ! Revelation is here! Don't get caught in sin by ignoring this message of our Gods Instructions to surrender your lives and live by faith! Keep The Ten Commandments as it's the way to eternal salvation !

Maybe he was going for  understated, but when you really look at his performance (particularly next to Pacino), it's flat, stiff, uninspired, and stands as foreshadowing to his decline. Put a bit of Don Vito Corleone next to some later Brando like Don Juan DiMarco or The Score, and I think the similarities become clear. \\n\\nThat's one angle for an Honest Trailer of The Godfather. \\n\\nThere could also be some light comparative analysis with Casino and Goodfellas and The Departed, plus there could be a bit of a deconstructionist take on the entire mob genre about glorifying men acting like melodramatic schoolyard bullies.

np1RFbKh5a0,"+ScreenJunkies News , another awesome Friday episode. +Billy Business ,you are looking good for the end of the week. (: And good reference to +Roth Cornet and your aunt. @ScreenJunkies News ,please use some combination of this group more often, please. 'Stranger Things' season 5 set in the late 1990's would be a total trip!! (good references everyone! please give us more shows like this one) drinking Surge (cola) reminded me of a late 90's beverage that made a come back this year... my favorite, the totally amazing Crystal (clear) Pepsi!!! and I still have my Jnco jeans (the straight leg jeans,not the big flair leg ones, of course they don't fit anymore) and shorts (I also had a pair of knockoff Jnco shorts in the 90's and wore them till they fell apart,lol). After superhero movies go into full decline, both horror movies, romcom and/or action/comedy (like from the 90's) movies need to make a comeback (points to both @Billy Business & @Joe Starr for saying that).We need more vampire stuff, now.(hehe) @SpencerJGilbert has the best idea, bring back the mid-budget stand alone movie, which can be in several genres (but saying the studio system was starting to get rolling in the 1970's.. is way off base. The true height of the studio system started in the middle 1920's with exclusive contracts for actors and directors,with the heads and executives of the major Hollywood studios' wielding enormous personal,creative and financial power). There is definitely a ton of rebooted Steven King movies comming, though I wish they would not do 'Christine' and some of the one's that we have already seen. @DanMurrell you are a producer here, make suggestions for a few select classic movies (and maybe Star Trek: The Next Generation) on +Honest Trailers. And good first job, but sorry about the triggering Christmas music. @Joe Starr ,feel for you man. My first big job was at K-Mart.. so the musak was totally inoffensive (but not the customers). Ahh, a 'Blank Check' story, interesting. Can't wait to see what went on Friday Happy Hour (tm) aka Flick Bait. lolz Thanks everybody @ScreenJunkies News",0,0

z5eG8fD-hQw,"Dumb Lump Hughley, You may not be a racist but you sure like to stereotype white people. All your points are one sided.   Lets make this one point for all dumb ass liberals who live in their own reality.  On many sides regarding Charlottesville was meant to describe the violence that took place.  Trump separated the moral stance of white supremasts and denounced them as its own entity of the situation. So the lumping of the morals of white supremasts and alt left never actually took place as you want to portray it.    The violence was what was lumped. It was initiated by the alt left and Antifa.  They showed up with the intention of breaking the law and inciting violence. The white supremast group came with their own weapons, not to incite violence but to meet it head on.  As a result an innocent peaceful protester got caught in the middle and was killed.  On many sides is a statement of fact.  I'm a white man and I'm fed up with the hatred of what I stand for.  According to your ideology, I shouldn't be allowed to be proud of being a white male.  You want me to be ashamed of it. You expect me to bow down to this stupidity.   I think we should all be treated equally with opportunities, respect and dignity but in no way am I going to be ashamed of anything that I never had any control of in the past.  This causes many white men to be forced into firing back with their own hatred of what you represent including the forgiveness of those looting of our property and assaulting us during natural disasters.   Your hate causes an equal and opposite hate. In some cases it causes a much deeper hate.",0,0

I do not believe the majority of U.S. Citizens are not racist and if he realy tried to blatantly pull some real racist shit we the peoplewould not stand for it. This motherfucker will only be in power a couple years. Instead of attacking him my fellow americans i say pressure your local officials to oppose any bills you dont like. Fucking congress and the senate are supposed to do OUR bidding. We cry that this is not fair or thats not fair... Want some good advice? STOP ELECTING THE SAME ASSHOLES WHO DONT DO SHIT TO HELP AND REPRESENT WE THE PEOPLE. We as american citizens need to take control of our nation once again. Its about the people remember? Our tax dollars get squandered. 99% of our elected officials dont give 2 shits about the PEOPLE who elect them.

ZCQuasiJgYM,"So i came here because this phone has a lot of backlash due to the price or the device itself. My opinion? Great phone, it is alright and it looks pretty fancy. \\nBut this is not how i want my future to look like. We can't just be all about phones or hi-tech, and be so materialistic.\\nWe also have to think about things in general. How about investing into something which could be useful for example new houses? Things that we need for a living, something that humanity just needs right now. People who made this device took alot of work, they are smart. But is it really smart to just focus on phones and things that aren't really that what we need? I'm just tired of people not helping out humanity, sticking to their own goods and some act really selfish. You don't have to agree, it is my opinion.",0,0

I think 1000 dollars is just crazy for a phone... the iPad pro 12 WITH the pencil (even more Pro) AND with that keyboard case is almost same price like this new iPhone (100 dollars difference) and it is a BEAST....people, be careful don't get drown on consumerism, I know,We LOVE Apple and they are amazing and everything they are doing is outstanding but sometimes we have to stop and think a little...",1,0
ZCQuasiJgYM,I wouldn't say people really buy iPhones for innovation. I'm saying this because I don't and all my friends don't either. Everyone knows Samsungs are ahead of the game when it comes to tech. iPhone is a lot more reliable and the OS feels WAY cleaner. I had the Samsung s8 plus for a week because I fell for its beautiful looks awesome specs. After using it for 2 days it got on my nerves and I just didn't like it at all.. That being said everyone has they're own opinion. I have had every Samsung and always end up switching back to iPhone... it must mean something ;),1,0

(: And good reference to +Roth Cornet and your aunt. @ScreenJunkies News ,please use some combination of this group more often, please. 'Stranger Things' season 5 set in the late 1990's would be a total trip!! (good references everyone! please give us more shows like this one) drinking Surge (cola) reminded me of a late 90's beverage that made a come back this year... my favorite, the totally amazing Crystal (clear) Pepsi!!! and I still have my Jnco jeans (the straight leg jeans,not the big flair leg ones, of course they don't fit anymore) and shorts (I also had a pair of knockoff Jnco shorts in the 90's and wore them till they fell apart,lol). After superhero movies go into full decline, both horror movies, romcom and/or action/comedy (like from the 90's) movies need to make a comeback (points to both @Billy Business & @Joe Starr for saying that).We need more vampire stuff, now.(hehe) @SpencerJGilbert has the best idea, bring back the mid-budget stand alone movie, which can be in several genres (but saying the studio system was starting to get rolling in the 1970's.. is way off base. The true height of the studio system started in the middle 1920's with exclusive contracts for actors and directors,with the heads and executives of the major Hollywood studios' wielding enormous personal,creative and financial power). There is definitely a ton of rebooted Steven King movies comming, though I wish they would not do 'Christine' and some of the one's that we have already seen. @DanMurrell you are a producer here, make suggestions for a few select classic movies (and maybe Star Trek: The Next Generation) on +Honest Trailers. And good first job, but sorry about the triggering Christmas music. @Joe Starr ,feel for you man. My first big job was at K-Mart.. so the musak was totally inoffensive (but not the customers).

z5eG8fD-hQw,"Dumb Lump Hughley, You may not be a racist but you sure like to stereotype white people. All your points are one sided.   Lets make this one point for all dumb ass liberals who live in their own reality.  On many sides regarding Charlottesville was meant to describe the violence that took place.  Trump separated the moral stance of white supremasts and denounced them as its own entity of the situation. So the lumping of the morals of white supremasts and alt left never actually took place as you want to portray it.    The violence was what was lumped. It was initiated by the alt left and Antifa.  They showed up with the intention of breaking the law and inciting violence. The white supremast group came with their own weapons, not to incite violence but to meet it head on.  As a result an innocent peaceful protester got caught in the middle and was killed.  On many sides is a statement of fact.  I'm a white man and I'm fed up with the hatred of what I stand for.  According to your ideology, I shouldn't be allowed to be proud of being a white male.  You want me to be ashamed of it. You expect me to bow down to this stupidity.   I think we should all be treated equally with opportunities, respect and dignity but in no way am I going to be ashamed of anything that I never had any control of in the past.  This causes many white men to be forced into firing back with their own hatred of what you represent including the forgiveness of those looting of our property and assaulting us during natural disasters.   Your hate causes an equal and opposite hate. In some cases it causes a much deeper hate.",0,0

Has he done or said some racist things? Probably but most people have at 1 time or another. I do not believe the majority of U.S. Citizens are not racist and if he realy tried to blatantly pull some real racist shit we the peoplewould not stand for it. This motherfucker will only be in power a couple years. Instead of attacking him my fellow americans i say pressure your local officials to oppose any bills you dont like. Fucking congress and the senate are supposed to do OUR bidding. We cry that this is not fair or thats not fair... Want some good advice? STOP ELECTING THE SAME ASSHOLES WHO DONT DO SHIT TO HELP AND REPRESENT WE THE PEOPLE. We as american citizens need to take control of our nation once again. Its about the people remember? Our tax dollars get squandered. 99% of our elected officials dont give 2 shits about the PEOPLE who elect them.

Trump's pardon of the man who performed sadistic treatment of people of color ( handcuffed a Hispanic woman to her bed while she was giving childbirth for example) from his position of sheriff says it all!!!  His jails were indeed Hell on earth because of his racism. He was convicted, but Trump pardons him???",0,0
z5eG8fD-hQw,"In my opinion if Ms. Hill should have stated facts to prove her position no one could argue with her on that so now his followers are mad because their president has that title. It takes away from the facts, he can say things and line himself with people that dont give one damn about anybody of color. It sadden me to witness this president line himself with people that do not care about all Americans. Nobody can tell me different, the president said he missed the good ole days when black people protest when we were beat, imprisoned and lynched, I can go on but why bother. Certain things will be embeded in my mind and certain things will be looked over because the truth is too much too bare.  Watch the 13th on Netflix",0,0

We have to believe that Jesus is is the son of God and that he is our Lord and Saviour. (John 3:16)\\n2. We have to accept him as our Lord and Saviour and believe that God raised him from the dead. (Romans 10:9)\\n3. Repent from all our sins. (2 Chronicles 7:14)\\n4. Be baptized in the name of Jesus. (Acts 2:38)\\n5. We have to have a deep relationship with him and pray to him and talk to him everyday. The only way to the Father is thru him. (John 14:6)\\n6. Read the Bible and learn the word of God. (Joshua 1:8)\\n7. Fast and pray. (Joel 2:12)\\n8. Speak the word of God to the ppl of the world. (Mark 16:15)\\n9. Do the Lord's will until we die. (Matthew 24:13)\\nOn Judgement day when we go before Jesus there will be many ppl who have prayed to Jesus and even done things in his name and Jesus will say to them depart from me I never knew U and they will go to Hell. This is why We have to have a deep relationship with Jesus and try to do everything he told us to do cause thats the only way we will make it to Heaven. (Matthew 7:20-23). We all fall short of the Glory of God and we are all sinners. (Romans 3:23) This is why Jesus came and died for our sins to be washed away so we could make it to Heaven. (Peter 3:18) Without Jesus we are doomed to Hell. (John 3:36) When we disobey God and sin, God curses us. (Galatians 3:10) God punishes us and puts curses on us to make us obedient to him cause he Loves us and wants us to do right. (Hebrews 12:6) Jesus sets us free from curses when we truly follow him. (Romans 8:2) Quit following everything else in the world like the Government, religion, schools, science, TV, movies, radio, and everything else. (Colossians 2:8) That is all ran by the Devil and his worshippers, the Illuminati. They lie to U and deceive U. Them and the fallen Angels who got kicked out of Heaven with Satan are trying to lead U to Hell. (Ephesians 6:12) \\nPut God 1st in your life. Never put anyone or anything before God, not your family friends job money or anything. (Matthew 6:33) If U Love Jesus then U hate evil. (Proverbs 8:13) Repent from all your sins. Pray to Jesus everyday. Pray to him for everything U need. (John 15:7) Pray to him and ask for forgiveness of your sins, thank him for everything. (Philippians 4:6)  Pray to him to heal U, give U peace, joy, strength, courage, protection, wisdom, knowledge, understanding, patience, direction, guidance, and for him to show U the truth. (Jeremiah 33:3) Do the Lord's will and he will answer your prayers.  (John 9:31) God gives us visions and he talks to us in dreams and shows us things. (Acts 2:17) When U die U will go before Jesus and he will judge U and either let U into Heaven or send U to Hell based on if U did his will. Those who don't do the Lord's will they will be sent to Hell. (Revelation 20:15) Hell is place where ppl will be punished and burn for eternity (Matthew 25:46) Heaven is a place that God has for the ppl who truly Love him. It is eternal paradise where U will be wit Jesus, the Angels, all the animals, and God's ppl forever. God says there will be no more death, we will have eternal life. We will not feel sorrow, we will not cry, and there will be no more pain. (Revelation 21:4) God says that we can't even imagine how amazing Heaven will be. (1 Corinthians 2:9) In Heaven we live forever, rejoice and be joyful forever. (Revelations 22:1-5)",0,2

9dobJDxPEzM,THIS VIDEO IS SO CLEVER!!!! She's tied to the ladder aka she's tied down and can't move aka she can't get away aka she can't get away from a relationship. The other person in the relationship drove a Dodge and basically the Dodges surround her aka the other person surrounds her and won't let her escape. THE MATTRESS DISAPPEARS TOWARD THE END BECAUSE THERE'S NO MORE COMFORT IN THE RELATIONSHIP. She's dancing with the people around her and at one point was free and willingly sat on the ladder but now she's tied down to the ladder but still want to dance with them aka be with her friends and other people BUT SHE'S TIED DOWN AND SHE CAN'T LEAVE. ALSO she sets herself on fire because she blames herself for the downfall of the relationship or blames herself for being tied down to the relationship and how she basically lit herself on fire by allowing to herself to be tied down? Wow idk that's my interpretation she's still clever even if I'm wrong. GREAT SONG GREAT VIDEO.,1,0

dvPJJUbM8IY,Literally the day that you uploaded this video an earthquake shook my hometown here in Puebla México. I would be really greatfull if you could share information on how to send help. I know there has been alot of natural desasters everywere but I'm just hoping you could help.,0,0
dvPJJUbM8IY,"I'm in school to be an Esthetician right now and I wouldn't exactly recommend for her exfoliate EVERY DAY. Especially since she is so young. Her cell turnover rate is probably somewhere in like the early 30s in reference to number of days. Some of these products are similar to what we use in facials at school. And we recommend facials every 3 weeks to a month. Also depending on your skin type, moisturizing I think it was twice along with a sunscreen. Ehhhhhhhh... I have very oily skin and that would cause me to break out. You could get by with it if you have a dryer skin type though.",0,0

dvPJJUbM8IY,"I think some people mistake their skin as oily when it's actually dry. When you have dry skin, your skin starts producing more oil than usual as a way of trying to hydrate itself. That's why moisturizing is so important, because when you moisturize, your skin stops producing excess oil. I always thought I had dry skin until a friend of mine mentioned this, and it actually made a lot of sense. So I did some research into it, and it's true. Dry skin = skin producing extra oil. Moisturizer = skin not needing to produce excess oil.",0,0

We have never been as close as were back then after that. We used to fight a lot back then, but we always made up and continued having good time together. I never realized how well everything was.

L6QAx5mqFKU,"I really don't get this whole gluten thing, I live in Germany and we eat a shit ton of bread, and I never ever have seen a person saying they are bloated because of bread or that they get a tummy ace. I guess a lot of that discomfort comes from processed foods with a lot of shit in it. I always feel like shit after eating a meal at McDonalds or just too much, but never because I ate a piece of bread. I know there are people who are sensitive to gluten or even alergic, but its not that many people. I personally only know one person that is allergic to it and feels and looks a lot better after going vegan. I think the amount and the quality of what you are eating are important and its really naive to think that if you just cut out this or that you will feel better. I guess everyone has to find his own balance of what and how much to eat to feel good by using our brain and informing ourselves at the same time and not just blindly follow what the newest nutritionist tells us. There are many reasons why you can feel bloated or tired like not enough activity, eating too fast, eating processed foods or even eating stuff that the bacteria in your gut like, like onions, if I eat to much onions I get bloated as fuck and then I just fart all the time, just linking it too gluten is not really thought out. Also have you never thought about the chemicals they put on wheat sometimes just before harvest? I guess there are many factors that influence our well being and there is not a perfect solution that fits everybody.",3,0

dvPJJUbM8IY,So they may have given you one mask cuz you only need to use it as needed no more than once or twice a week.

dvPJJUbM8IY,"If you are interested in some spot treatment items, you could use pimple patches by cortex or the Pink Powder from Cureacle. For both, (You can use either or) just put it on your pimple/acne spot overnight and by the next morning it will smaller and less inflamed. \\n\\nFor the patch, if you see this white thing forming, that's all the oils and moisture being taken out by the patch so you can go ahead and throw the sticker away once it reaches that state. \\n\\nAnd when you use the powder, DO NOT AND I REPEAT DO NOT SHAKE IT. Use a Q-tip and dab the powder onto the acne/pimple. It will have a slight burning feel for the first couple of seconds but don't worry that's what it is supposed to do. And then the next morning take some toner and wipe it off. \\n\\nI do suggest that when you put these products on to not put moisturizer on those spots before hand otherwise it's going to suck up the moisture from the moisturizer and not your actual pimple. You can buy the acne patches off of amazon and the pink powder off of memebox.\\n\\nAnd while I cannot guarantee that this will work for you because keep in mind that everybody's skin reacts differently to different items, you could go ahead and give it a try. I has done miracles for me, and maybe it can for you as well!! I hope you guys found this a bit helpful and if you have any questions, don't be afraid to comment here!!

I've had pretty severe t-zone acne for around two years and my mom thought it was just puberty and stuff so she didn't do anything but recently this year I went to a dermatologist and she said that not even lasers could fix my scars but she gave my topicals to use and that has greatly improved the purple and redness of the scars but if you look closely and if you put foundation over my forehead you can see the indents. I didn't pick or pop my zits when I had them but I still scarred pretty badly. I just wish there was something that could fix it.,0,0

dvPJJUbM8IY,"Really disappointed in this video. You talk at the end about putting in the time and effort, but you didn't appear to do that to make this video. Soko Glam does an amazing job at explaining the Korean Skincare Routine through their Klog. You did not do this routine justice at all, but instead made all the most common and completely avoidable mistakes that people make when they don't bother to educate themselves on what they are trying to do. I bet if you had contacted Charlotte Cho (co-founder of Soko Glam) you would have been given an opportunity to do a really great collab and make a truly useful video with a real review of the Korean Skincare Routine. Instead it seems like you woke up one day and decided to give it a go and didn't even bother to do proper research. Sheets masks are not every day, exfoliating is not every day, some of the steps like chemical peels are not every day but rather interchangeable during a given week or even a season of the year.

We have never been as close as were back then after that. We used to fight a lot back then, but we always made up and continued having good time together. I never realized how well everything was. Now he has changed a lot and we rarely see each other or talk. But we sometimes do though. We are now in the same school, but the year we were apart from each other changed our friendship a lot.

L6QAx5mqFKU,"I really don't get this whole gluten thing, I live in Germany and we eat a shit ton of bread, and I never ever have seen a person saying they are bloated because of bread or that they get a tummy ace. I guess a lot of that discomfort comes from processed foods with a lot of shit in it. I always feel like shit after eating a meal at McDonalds or just too much, but never because I ate a piece of bread. I know there are people who are sensitive to gluten or even alergic, but its not that many people. I personally only know one person that is allergic to it and feels and looks a lot better after going vegan. I think the amount and the quality of what you are eating are important and its really naive to think that if you just cut out this or that you will feel better. I guess everyone has to find his own balance of what and how much to eat to feel good by using our brain and informing ourselves at the same time and not just blindly follow what the newest nutritionist tells us. There are many reasons why you can feel bloated or tired like not enough activity, eating too fast, eating processed foods or even eating stuff that the bacteria in your gut like, like onions, if I eat to much onions I get bloated as fuck and then I just fart all the time, just linking it too gluten is not really thought out. Also have you never thought about the chemicals they put on wheat sometimes just before harvest? I guess there are many factors that influence our well being and there is not a perfect solution that fits everybody.",4,0

One was like sick for years and losing weight until he got tested and found everything was caused from gluten. If you actually have Celiac you can/will get very sick from eating even just a little gluten. Reading labels is VERY important and leaning what words mean it has gluten (in ingredient list),0,0

I've listened to your albums all the way through a ridiculous amount of times (Probably a couple hundred times each at this point). I remember during your first tour you went to Lawrence Kansas and I was unable to go due to school, but when you came around for your second tour, you hit Colombia Missouri, which is where my girlfriend was going to college. Me and a bunch of friends piled into a shitty cavalier and drove out and it was the best concert I've ever been to. I recall taking a picture when you were on top of a speaker, took your shirt off, and I realized Oh shit I know what's about to happen and managed to put my phone away right before you landed square on top of me and my friends. I just wanted you to know how much you've helped me, as I was in a long term relationship for about 6 years, and your music got me through hard times, and it got me through some really great times as well. Happy to announce we are now living together in our first home and will be getting married in 3 weeks! If you want an invite hit me up. Can't wait to see where you go next, i'll be there.",0,0

Z4QcwsEbKyo,"Totally crazy to restrict consumers choice. If Uber is 'Unfit' then shouldn't 'Black Cabs' also be 'Unfit' to run a taxi service????? They make it sound there are no rape cases with black cab drivers when in fact on average is reported at least twice a month for sexual assaults. There are a lot of rape cases with black cabs so how on earth are they 'fit' to run a service and not Uber? Do they mean Uber has not been extended it's license because black cabs are 'Threatened' by an innovative business? I've had such bad experiences with Black Cab drivers, it is beyond unacceptable. In fact, I will find the video to post it on youtube as I recorded this on video- a black cab driver almost hit me & my bf, then he puts the window down to shout and swear at us, then he got out of his car to punch my bf just because he shouted back how unfitly the driver was driving. And there are many more stories to tell.. So are black cabs really 'Safe & Fit' to provide a service??? Some people cannot afford to use a black cab. And ever since Uber's existence, women feel safer to go out in the evenings because they know they can get home using uber as is much more affordable for everyone in London. If there is no Uber, I'm sure there will be more rape cases in the streets of London...

Z4QcwsEbKyo,"Uber had plenty of chances to conform and follow the rules that all other Private Hire companies follow, but they chose not to. The victims here are the Uber drivers and the culprit is the greed of Uber and TfL. TfL, from the start, allowed Uber to bypass laws that all other PH companies had to follow by law. Once the numbers of drivers started coming through, TfL saw Uber as a great way of raising money. 100% increase in PH drivers in 4 years? Really? Think about it. All the points that have led to the refusal of Uber's licence are things that other PH companies are doing as a matter of course. But really, TfL allowing Uber to use their own company to do DBS checks and then they are wrong ones? Uber convincing passengers that complaints should go to Uber first? Not TfL or the Police but Uber? Even sexual assaults. I honestly feel for their legitimate drivers but I'm sure that a lot of PH and Taxi drivers in Brighton and Welwyn Garden etc, where TfL licensed Uber drivers are illegally plying for hire and stealing their living, are glad to see them go.",0,0

I like companies like Uber that shake up old, entrenched business interests.  We need more competition in the world.  Not less!  If people are being attacked in Uber rides, then maybe the police haven't yet done their job properly.  I immediately know if I want to be around someone.  Why would you get in a ride that you weren't sure about?  I can't believe people are that helpless, that they need a super-duper-certified official cab service.  Uber needs to add a ride-alone or ride-with others rate option, to give users more control over their experience.  These regulations are non-sense.

tlTKTTt47WE,"My take on this is what if our idea of a simulation is actually reality at it's most fundamental. What if all of reality is just information in a pattern, how the pattern is generated or how complex it is doesn't really matter. We interpret it as we can and make of it what we will, as will every other part of this pattern of information considered existence. I think this takes away the need for some 'omnipotent programmer', which is really the biggest problem i have with this idea. What makes that entity exist outside of our system? It seems like if they were outside of it ,they couldn't really interact with it without being affected by the creation (us) right back, so does that make the simulation just as real as the 'omnipotent programmer'?

What each of us has to live with is that you have a choice of what metaphysics to believe - with the key consideration being that what you believe deeply shapes your actions. Which ultimately leaves you with the real question this video summons: would believing this worldview cause you to behave in a way that you want to behave? The answer to this question speaks most deeply to whether or not the simulation argument is one you will adopt as your own, or not.",0,0

All our best computer programs get glitches and stuff every so often that gives it away that they are computers.  And the only other simulated reality we know of, dreams, are glitchy af.  \\nBut, I do actually hope that life is a simulation because if it is, then that means that technology has already progressed somewhere to God like levels.  I feel that the ultimate goal of the universe is to become totally conscious of itself, and manifest its absolute potential.  Such a thing would only be possible through incredibly intelligent beings so advanced, we might think of them as Gods because they pretty much would have the ability to do almost anything.  Maybe that is what God is.  Maybe the God of this universe started out just like we did... in ignorance.  Maybe it just found itself existing some day as a single cell, experiencing death, and didn't know how it came to be, but then after billions of years, it evolved to such a thing that it had the power to create a universe.  \\nBut I don't know.  Things like the fermi paradox worries me.  I worry that maybe EVERY civilization just gets wiped out eventually, before ever having the ability to transcend biological limitations, or travel the universe.  Whether they destroy themselves, or just every planet gets unlucky eventually, and gets hit by asteroids, or gamma ray bursts..... constantly destroying millions of years of evolution.  If that is the case, we may never know the full potential of the universe.  I WANT there to be advanced civilizations.  I want this to be a simulation made by a super smart thing.

This is true for all of human history. Sure, we have wars and sports and media of our own, but why would they bother simulating the rest of human life? And if it is scientifically accurate, a species intelligent enough to produce the amount of computing power even close to simulating the entire universe would most likely already be so intelligent that they wouldn't find anything that would broaden their horizons by any amount that would be worth the effort in their simulation.",0,0

tlTKTTt47WE,"not so long ago, I was so confused and inundated with endless philosophies, there is nothing worse than to live the life of a philosopher. A philosopher is someone who in his pride seeks enlightenment, while refusing instruction. His pride is suppressed sadness, because he failed to find someone greater than himself. He walks the world as an orphan, because he abandoned the teachings of his Father. He finds weakness in the ignorance of the meek, but fails to realize that God uses the ignorant to humiliate the prudent, so that no man may presume before God. A  philosopher dies a philosopher, with a big question mark in his tomb, because he never found his answer.  Everywhere he looked he found vanity, because he boasted in his mind and threw away his heart.. vanity is the opposite of purpose, knowledge without application, existence without utility. He who does not live to serve, does not serve to live.. \\n\\nBrethren meditate on the Word of God. Read the New Testament, read about the life of our Father Jesus Christ. Accept him into your heart and life and he will reveal himself to you. He is the almighty God, our loving Father. He created the universe, the heavens and the earth, everything that exists was made by him. I used to be a lost philosopher in an endless search for the truth, this search almost took me to the grave.. Until one day Jesus Christ revealed himself to me.. He is real, God is very real, and he loves all of his children.\\n\\nIf you are a philosopher, this message is for you... \\nA mathematical problem is solved using the mind, a  poetic love riddle is solved using the heart, and a potentially dangerous gas leak is detected using your nose..  \\nEach unit of consciousness has a different and unique domain of perception, all serve unique and different functions. All units must work in harmony in order to discern the genuine, from the illusive...\\n\\nPhilosophy comes from the mind's perception, Faith comes from the heart's perception.\\n\\nSo why are we searching for the Spirit of God with our mind instead of using our heart? Just because the eyes can't see thunder doesn't mean thunder doesn't exist, and just because the ears can't hear lightning doesn't mean lightning doesn't exist. All units must work in harmony.\\n\\nJust like your eyes can't hear thunder and your ears can't see lightning, neither can your logic perceive what your emotions can.\\n\\nListen to your heart. God is very real. We have numbed our hearts and pushed him away from our lives.. be of humble hearts and seek God... Allow me to make it easy for you brethren...  \\n\\nJesus Christ is God, seek him, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.\\n\\nCall on God with a humble heart and he will answer, you will see his light, and hear his voice, and feel his Holy presence. You will witness the very essence of God's undeniable existence, Invite your Father Jesus Christ into your heart and I promise you, you will never in your life doubt again,  because you will see for yourself, that he is the one and only Truth, and there is no other God beside him. Brethren, leave this world of destructive new age philosophies, this world will take you into chaos and oblivion, you will fall into the snares of the devil, insanity will consume you...The world is against God. Flee from this world of evil and look for the light. Everything is full of purpose, God has a plan for humanity, and has a plan for each and every one of us. The Father will bring judgement into the world and will sever the wicked from the just. He will reveal all that was hidden since the foundation of the world. peace be unto you and to all whom the Lord has called, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.",0,0

But I digress..)\\n\\nThere are valid, deeply mathematical, physical, and cosmology postulates being debated deep in basements and cluttered offices of the current Hawking generation of quantum physicists - some with scary possibilities.   One I personally like is the Heisenberg quandary.  There's only so far we can go down to in our current theoretical, experimentation, and observation  capabilities.  The more energy we use to smash particles together at CERN, the more weird things get.  It is starting to appear that the higher power of our proverbial microscopes, the more granular the quantum foundation of our universe looks.  No more linear somewhere between X and Y that our Newtonian world understands.  Position and momentum are stepped with no in-betweens.  Hmmm. Someone threw out the possibility that these could be the smallest limits of a simulation, similar to the highest number of digits our computers can handle.  What if the Heisenberg quantum states are the minimal processing limit states of this massive computer you speak of?  Similar to just how much an i7 processor can handle, what if every quantum particle state in the universe is actually a dedicated processor register in this theoretical simulation?  (string theory, for example - my Apologies to Brian Greene for my poor attempt that may butcher his excellent explanations (I'm only a lowly engineer - but a very curious and happy one  :)  )  This is an intriguing idea that the biological processes and physical world we live under ARE ACTUALLY being simulated at the sub-sub-sub atomic levels, and therefore we are actually blobs of proteins and lipids evolving FOR REAL in this simulation.  Seems to me a lot of trouble to cover conscience awareness of each being if you can simulate the real universe down to whatever the real truth is (23 dimensional strings vs 10 dimensional, closed vs. open, vibrating vs. whatever)\\n\\n The same argument you made for the very big, Godlike civilization would also apply to this thought experiment.  But there are already some heavy hitters on it.  Several publications of proposed tests have been written, and are quite entertaining to even this lowly engineer.  (But still a science geek).  My personal favorite so far is the holographic paradox.  How does this quantum-level simulation stand up to what we know of black holes, where quantum fails? (Still working on that unified theory thing).  If we are a simulation, an outsider would see it in n-1 dimensions.  Can they observe without affecting it?  \\n\\nBut that's where my feeble attempt to understand cosmology becomes something like Roy Batty wanting to live a few more years.  I go into a depressed nihilism mode where I don't have any friends to discuss this over late night, fire-lit, drinking evenings.  Seems to me this simulation is doing a good job of trying to kill us with asteroids, radiation, GRB's, genetic defects, and not to mention several thousand megaton fusion warheads (each) pointed at each other with a hair trigger of nervous and tired command and control crews.  I personally don't like the aging thing.  Would be great if I could get a second degree for fun and learning instead of putting food on the table...  Biological decrepitude is getting in the way.  But I digress again.  Nice cartoon BTW!",0,0

9VjKMTwFXMw,"Pescaito no es un barrio cualquiera, es la estirpe viva de la Santa Marta Popular, poco después del nacimiento de la República La ciudad más antigua de Colombia conocería a su primer arrabal, su primer enclave sub urbano después de la colonia, Pescaito encierra mágicamente toda un amalgama de colores, herencias, sabores y sonidos. En poco más de 120 años de historia este populoso sector de la ciudad se hizo inmortal y no fue precisamente por el Pibe, para nada, hay personajes más influyentes que él. Pescaito ha dado siempre lo mejor, las mejores putas, los ladrones más astutos, temibles sicarios, los mejores médicos, profesores, tamboreros, humoristas, cultores, bailadores de salsa,  picoteros, coteros, fritangueras, boxeadores, futbolistas, beisbolistas, softbolistas, jugadores de dominó y macana de la ciudad y del caribe colombiano (nota tomada explicitamente de mi papá, Agustín Olivero, pescaitero neto y nieto de uno de los primeros colonizadores del barrio viejo, el antiguo sector de las ensenadas o camino viejo a Taganga, antigua calle 25 con actual carera 9a, mi bisabuelo Alejandro Olivere, un Granadino (antilla menor) que salió huyendo en 1908 de Fort de France, Martinica, para aterrizar con mi bisabuela Agustine Luxén, mamá del famoso boxeador Kid Dunlop, el más grande que ha dado la ciudad. Cuenta mi padre que su abuelo en un extraño papiamento le refería como llegaron a la ciudad y como surgió el barrio con influencias antillanas muy marcadas en sus primeros estilos de vida, la arquitectura, los hábitos, la gastronomía y el jolgorio, los cuales se mezclaron con lo que ya había, gente de Bolivar, braceros rasos del muele viejo y trabajadores o cortadores de racimo en las florecientes fincas bananeras antes de la masacre, mucho antes. Apareció así la GUACHERNA, que vives muy bien rebautizó con el PITAN PTAN, pero aparecería un sinnúmero de ingredientes que hacen de este barrio un verdadero patrimonio, porque todo pasa en Pescaíto, mi barrio.",1,0

I would like to ask you something though, bro. I'm dropping my first album in a couple months with hip hop style mostly, yet I don't usually like to listen to rap because of its typical lyrical content, the meaningless gibberish, you know what I'm saying?

The fact that your music and videos can both stand on their own as such interesting works is something I'm not aware of elsewhere. My best friend showed me the pale kid video back in, like, 2011, and I've been hooked ever since. You're an important person, Watsky, and I hope you're even remotely aware of how much respect people have for you, even if it's just for one aspect of your life.",0,0

QAT8fXZI0b0,"Watsky,\\nI just wanted to say thank you. For a number of years now you've been my favorite artist, one of the most relatable, and by far the deepest and most complex. I've listened to your albums all the way through a ridiculous amount of times (Probably a couple hundred times each at this point). I remember during your first tour you went to Lawrence Kansas and I was unable to go due to school, but when you came around for your second tour, you hit Colombia Missouri, which is where my girlfriend was going to college. Me and a bunch of friends piled into a shitty cavalier and drove out and it was the best concert I've ever been to. I recall taking a picture when you were on top of a speaker, took your shirt off, and I realized Oh shit I know what's about to happen and managed to put my phone away right before you landed square on top of me and my friends. I just wanted you to know how much you've helped me, as I was in a long term relationship for about 6 years, and your music got me through hard times, and it got me through some really great times as well. Happy to announce we are now living together in our first home and will be getting married in 3 weeks! If you want an invite hit me up. Can't wait to see where you go next, i'll be there.",0,0

Z4QcwsEbKyo,"Uber had plenty of chances to conform and follow the rules that all other Private Hire companies follow, but they chose not to. The victims here are the Uber drivers and the culprit is the greed of Uber and TfL. TfL, from the start, allowed Uber to bypass laws that all other PH companies had to follow by law. Once the numbers of drivers started coming through, TfL saw Uber as a great way of raising money. 100% increase in PH drivers in 4 years? Really? Think about it. All the points that have led to the refusal of Uber's licence are things that other PH companies are doing as a matter of course. But really, TfL allowing Uber to use their own company to do DBS checks and then they are wrong ones? Uber convincing passengers that complaints should go to Uber first? Not TfL or the Police but Uber? Even sexual assaults. I honestly feel for their legitimate drivers but I'm sure that a lot of PH and Taxi drivers in Brighton and Welwyn Garden etc, where TfL licensed Uber drivers are illegally plying for hire and stealing their living, are glad to see them go.",0,0
Z4QcwsEbKyo,"This is conspiracy,Uber try to avoid responsibility,they had four mounts to resolve the problem with TfL,and they didn't find any solution because this is theatre ,even they don't prepare the drivers about this because are irresponsible and they must be convicted to pay conpesations to all this people",0,0

Z4QcwsEbKyo,"Totally crazy to restrict consumers choice. If Uber is 'Unfit' then shouldn't 'Black Cabs' also be 'Unfit' to run a taxi service????? They make it sound there are no rape cases with black cab drivers when in fact on average is reported at least twice a month for sexual assaults. There are a lot of rape cases with black cabs so how on earth are they 'fit' to run a service and not Uber? Do they mean Uber has not been extended it's license because black cabs are 'Threatened' by an innovative business? I've had such bad experiences with Black Cab drivers, it is beyond unacceptable. In fact, I will find the video to post it on youtube as I recorded this on video- a black cab driver almost hit me & my bf, then he puts the window down to shout and swear at us, then he got out of his car to punch my bf just because he shouted back how unfitly the driver was driving. And there are many more stories to tell.. So are black cabs really 'Safe & Fit' to provide a service??? Some people cannot afford to use a black cab. And ever since Uber's existence, women feel safer to go out in the evenings because they know they can get home using uber as is much more affordable for everyone in London. If there is no Uber, I'm sure there will be more rape cases in the streets of London... Thanks to the selfishness and profit driven black cab shitty services who's been constantly protesting to take Uber down",0,0

It sickens me to see so few in that party doing this, but at least we have some.  As for the Democratic Party, maybe at some point, they will be invited into the process of making a bill, and together, the two parties can come up with something more like we Americans want, which is universal health care for ALL Americans.

I've listened to your albums all the way through a ridiculous amount of times (Probably a couple hundred times each at this point). I remember during your first tour you went to Lawrence Kansas and I was unable to go due to school, but when you came around for your second tour, you hit Colombia Missouri, which is where my girlfriend was going to college. Me and a bunch of friends piled into a shitty cavalier and drove out and it was the best concert I've ever been to. I recall taking a picture when you were on top of a speaker, took your shirt off, and I realized Oh shit I know what's about to happen and managed to put my phone away right before you landed square on top of me and my friends. I just wanted you to know how much you've helped me, as I was in a long term relationship for about 6 years, and your music got me through hard times, and it got me through some really great times as well. Happy to announce we are now living together in our first home and will be getting married in 3 weeks! If you want an invite hit me up. Can't wait to see where you go next, i'll be there.",0,0

9VjKMTwFXMw,"Pescaito no es un barrio cualquiera, es la estirpe viva de la Santa Marta Popular, poco después del nacimiento de la República La ciudad más antigua de Colombia conocería a su primer arrabal, su primer enclave sub urbano después de la colonia, Pescaito encierra mágicamente toda un amalgama de colores, herencias, sabores y sonidos. En poco más de 120 años de historia este populoso sector de la ciudad se hizo inmortal y no fue precisamente por el Pibe, para nada, hay personajes más influyentes que él. Pescaito ha dado siempre lo mejor, las mejores putas, los ladrones más astutos, temibles sicarios, los mejores médicos, profesores, tamboreros, humoristas, cultores, bailadores de salsa,  picoteros, coteros, fritangueras, boxeadores, futbolistas, beisbolistas, softbolistas, jugadores de dominó y macana de la ciudad y del caribe colombiano (nota tomada explicitamente de mi papá, Agustín Olivero, pescaitero neto y nieto de uno de los primeros colonizadores del barrio viejo, el antiguo sector de las ensenadas o camino viejo a Taganga, antigua calle 25 con actual carera 9a, mi bisabuelo Alejandro Olivere, un Granadino (antilla menor) que salió huyendo en 1908 de Fort de France, Martinica, para aterrizar con mi bisabuela Agustine Luxén, mamá del famoso boxeador Kid Dunlop, el más grande que ha dado la ciudad. Cuenta mi padre que su abuelo en un extraño papiamento le refería como llegaron a la ciudad y como surgió el barrio con influencias antillanas muy marcadas en sus primeros estilos de vida, la arquitectura, los hábitos, la gastronomía y el jolgorio, los cuales se mezclaron con lo que ya había, gente de Bolivar, braceros rasos del muele viejo y trabajadores o cortadores de racimo en las florecientes fincas bananeras antes de la masacre, mucho antes. Apareció así la GUACHERNA, que vives muy bien rebautizó con el PITAN PTAN, pero aparecería un sinnúmero de ingredientes que hacen de este barrio un verdadero patrimonio, porque todo pasa en Pescaíto, mi barrio.",5,0

Believe it or not black cabs are actually fairly priced you would know this if you ever used them. Iv used both black cabs and minicabs and i support both, the only difference is a black cab driver is a fully qualified taxi driver and knows exactly were there going and the quickest way to get you there i got quoted £15 to go to my local hospital by a minicab firm and a black cab got me there for £14 at 3 in the morning.

Why are they not renewing black cab's license? It's all about big money and influence. Black cab transports the Royal family staff and the owner has friends in high places. They're shutting down black cab's competitor, uber,  which is unfair trading practices and goes against free market principles. Competition helps the consumer by offering them lower prices.",1,0

If the women fear being raped by an uber driver, they will stop using their services and uber will go out of business due to lack of customers. From what I understand, there are actually less rapes and sexual assaults reported against uber drivers than there are with your black cab drivers. This shows it's all about money and power. Apparently the owner of black cab has influence with the government to shut down his competition that is offering a service at a lower price.",1,0

2Lq5pZrbpHc,"I really love all the Mormonts. they all are just such likable characters. Jeor and Jorah are both men who have pasts that weigh heavy on their minds, and how they act in the present. they aren't boastful, like many other great warriors from other houses, yet they are incredible fighters. Jeor clearly has great compassion for all the members of the nights watch, even the worst of them, treating them as his own both when giving affection and support and when punishment and disappointment. I like the Show's depiction of Jorah's fighting skills, yes, he'll get hit, and he isn't the is flawless superhuman, but has a seeming inability to give up. he preservers through the hardships, through getting the shit kicked out of him, because he knows he can take more than any he faces can give, and he has the motivation to keep pushing on. Lyanna is interesting, as she's the most boastful Mormont, but not in an arrogant way. She's proud of her people, home, and family and clearly has a deep love for them. she is also one of the most if not the most capable child-ruler we've seen on the show. she doesn't let adults bully her or control her as a puppet like Jeoffrey, Tommen, and Robin Aryn.

You have at your fingertips the power to simulate so many universes, so many different iterations of the same universe where different people learn different things and come up with different solutions to different problems, different innovations and ideas, that once you reach that point you can essentially make your own universe into a perfect one.

tlTKTTt47WE,"I'd say the best argument against this is that a a civilization or entity intelligent enough to simulate our reality would not create such a cruel one. Whatever this is, I really doubt it was on purpose. This opinion is coming from one of the most privileged examples of a human to have existed so far. Even if our feelings and experiences are but a crumb of what our creators are capable of feeling, why would they bother? We may study ants but we did not create them for our own pleasure. If you are so desperate to cling to the idea of man being created, you have to ask where the creators came from? Origin is like an onion with infinite layers to peel off. You are left with the same question no matter how far you go, eventually something came from nothing and makes no sense. Even if consciousness is a recursion unto itself, even if everything is happening all at once and time is just another axis if you view it from a higher dimension, even if you are a confused god who shattered its mind to escape solitude that now unwittingly lives in its own creation, it can't ever completely make sense, I believe. I'm not saying you should stop searching for answers, it is good for us to be more aware of our circumstances; I'm saying don't ever stop searching because there is no light at the end of the tunnel and that means we can always keep going further beyond whatever answers we think we've found.",0,0

I've listened to your albums all the way through a ridiculous amount of times (Probably a couple hundred times each at this point). I remember during your first tour you went to Lawrence Kansas and I was unable to go due to school, but when you came around for your second tour, you hit Colombia Missouri, which is where my girlfriend was going to college. Me and a bunch of friends piled into a shitty cavalier and drove out and it was the best concert I've ever been to. I recall taking a picture when you were on top of a speaker, took your shirt off, and I realized Oh shit I know what's about to happen and managed to put my phone away right before you landed square on top of me and my friends. I just wanted you to know how much you've helped me, as I was in a long term relationship for about 6 years, and your music got me through hard times, and it got me through some really great times as well. Happy to announce we are now living together in our first home and will be getting married in 3 weeks! If you want an invite hit me up. Can't wait to see where you go next, i'll be there.",0,0

Z4QcwsEbKyo,If you want a decent service you pay a decent price.  You get what you pay for.  If Uber drivers want to be a taxi driver then do it.  If they think buying a uniform is expensive then try licensing a taxi and keeping it on the rd.  There's reasons laws are in place for taxi drivers and uber is just a cowboy outfit.  I wonder how many women have been actually attacked.  I bet a whole lot more than the bullshit media lets on.   It ain't safe if anyone can be an uber driver.

Z4QcwsEbKyo,"What makes me laugh is all the comments like will have to get black cabs now who rip everybody off etc, none of the people making these comments have ever used black cabs before uber and wont after uber is gone so give it a rest, have you never heard of a minicab office? uber have only been in london a few years what do you think Londoners was doing before uber? minicab offices and black cabs were coexisting peacefully before uber arrived in it will just go back to that, another thing about 40,000 uber drivers face unemployment no they dont they will simply return back to the minicab offices and work from there. Believe it or not black cabs are actually fairly priced you would know this if you ever used them. Iv used both black cabs and minicabs and i support both, the only difference is a black cab driver is a fully qualified taxi driver and knows exactly were there going and the quickest way to get you there i got quoted £15 to go to my local hospital by a minicab firm and a black cab got me there for £14 at 3 in the morning.

Yes, Uber is comparatively cheaper and more convenient than most London cabs but the company does not carry out thorough background checks on drivers & has a lacklustre approach to dealing with criminal offenses. So, this means that you are getting on a car with someone who could potentially harm you. I myself was a victim of verbal assualt by an Uber driver who threathened/swore at me only because I pointed out that he was taking a longer route, and when I complained to Uber about this all they did was refunded my fare and dismissed the case. This needs to change. They cannot be running a business making money off us customers and at the same time putting our lives at risk like that whilst taking zero responsibility for anything.

Z4QcwsEbKyo,Fuck black cabs they over charge and con customers that's why people use uber because they are cheaper plus tfl say that black cabs are safer but there has been more sexual assaults by Cab/taxi drivers over the years and they say black cabs are safer my arse they are just as bad as each other,2,0
Z4QcwsEbKyo,"Uber had 32 allegations of sexual assault or rape, but there were 122 allegations of sexual assault and rape against black cab and other taxi companies in the UK last year. Why are they not renewing black cab's license? It's all about big money and influence. Black cab transports the Royal family staff and the owner has friends in high places. They're shutting down black cab's competitor, uber,  which is unfair trading practices and goes against free market principles. Competition helps the consumer by offering them lower prices.",1,0

Z4QcwsEbKyo,In all honesty as a young person I hate this.

Z4QcwsEbKyo,"If the people over in the UK want to ride in uber taxis, they should be free to do so. If the women fear being raped by an uber driver, they will stop using their services and uber will go out of business due to lack of customers. From what I understand, there are actually less rapes and sexual assaults reported against uber drivers than there are with your black cab drivers. This shows it's all about money and power. Apparently the owner of black cab has influence with the government to shut down his competition that is offering a service at a lower price.",1,0
Z4QcwsEbKyo,"Most uber drivers are poor migrants from eastern europe and middle east, it makes sense to ban Uber so locals can do traditional cab jobs for higher pay.\\n\\nThis also reduce the number of jobs in that sector so the migrant workers can go back to their own country.",1,1

2Lq5pZrbpHc,"I really love all the Mormonts. they all are just such likable characters. Jeor and Jorah are both men who have pasts that weigh heavy on their minds, and how they act in the present. they aren't boastful, like many other great warriors from other houses, yet they are incredible fighters. Jeor clearly has great compassion for all the members of the nights watch, even the worst of them, treating them as his own both when giving affection and support and when punishment and disappointment. I like the Show's depiction of Jorah's fighting skills, yes, he'll get hit, and he isn't the is flawless superhuman, but has a seeming inability to give up. he preservers through the hardships, through getting the shit kicked out of him, because he knows he can take more than any he faces can give, and he has the motivation to keep pushing on. Lyanna is interesting, as she's the most boastful Mormont, but not in an arrogant way. She's proud of her people, home, and family and clearly has a deep love for them. she is also one of the most if not the most capable child-ruler we've seen on the show. she doesn't let adults bully her or control her as a puppet like Jeoffrey, Tommen, and Robin Aryn. She knows she must assert herself and make decisions on her own to avoid being trampled politically.  The Mormonts are an underrated house.",0,0

He could have continued to spy on her until she was killed but he did the right thing. He had a lot to gain by doing her harm but he gave that all up to do the right thing so Jorah is all good in my book and I hope he survived this story.,0,0

What if OUR hardware was based on extremely slow chemical reactions rather than the firing of the synapses? Then our thought process time scale would be  *comparatively* (I personally think there are no ABSOLUTE concepts of big or small, unless measured in comparative sense) scaled down. Hard to imagine, but it's a solution.\\n\\nPerhaps the creators of the computer simulation also has control of passage of time and the computer producing the simulation is on accelerated forward passage of time. Though, I imagine, there would be problems with interfacing of objects running at different time speed.\\n\\nSo an human real time interface between the consciousness (supposedly human) and computer producing the simulation is another assumption.",0,0

Make it go 1/10 the speed and you increase the computer power by 10.\\n-Why would a simulation need to create a reality with their own laws of science? It's absurd to speculate what is on the other side.\\n-Super intelligence is not needed. Why would it? Just a lot of time and effort. Or an AI to cross the singularity.\\n-You missed the point that this is an inevitability. We are absolutely going to do this ourselves within 100 to 200 years.

The first people to live in simulation will be people imprisoned in their real bodies from disease and injury.

tlTKTTt47WE,"The big missing paradox here is, all of the statements made in this video regarding the prevalence of alien life, computing power, size/age of the universe, even the underlying laws of physics dictating how possible ANY of this is, are based on what we have observed of our universe.  But if we are in a simulation...then none of that can even be trusted.  IF we are simulated, then the real universe may not look or work anything like the one we see.  Which means...we have no way of even beginning to guess how likely us being in a simulation is!",0,0
tlTKTTt47WE,"I have an idea: what if we are simulated. But something that's not realised is that, if we can create our own simulations, it would break the very computer operating our universe. As it has been proven that a computer cannot simulate another computer as or more powerful than itself. You can't simulate a gaming PC on your phone, or even another phone(with the exact same specs as your current phonr) on your own phone because it takes processing power to run both your operating system, and the simulations and the specs deticated to the simulation. so it is impossible, unless the computer your simulating is slower than the original. Then your good, but other than that? No. Just no.\\n\\nSo, there is a way to test if we are in a simulation. We build a quantum computer the size of New York City. Then, we boot it up and try to run our own simulations. If we are in a simulation, our reality would cease to exist and the original computer crashes from having an extreme overload. If we aren't in a simulation... The computer will work just fine and... Be running simulations... Meaning that our lives do have meaning and aren't some fabric of some digital world... That the microbes that we observe are still there when we aren't looking... That our bodies really are full of bubbly stuff, even if they aren't open... Meaning that the atoms inside a log are still their even though you can't see them... That nothing is empty, everything we see exist and will still exist... \\n\\n\\nEssentially it's the opposite of an existential crisis... Which is worse, because instead of finding yourself pointless, you regret the bad things you did in the past... That one time you burned an ant out of curiosity.. that the ant wasn't fake, it was real... And that every bad thing you did, was real, and have real consequences... Effect real people... Effect a real world, real beings... Real life forms with their own, much more simple, conscience...

From what I understand, there are actually less rapes and sexual assaults reported against uber drivers than there are with your black cab drivers. This shows it's all about money and power. Apparently the owner of black cab has influence with the government to shut down his competition that is offering a service at a lower price.",1,0

uZ8L6qLeC74,"Never really comment ever, but i always like Ingrid's personality and want to show some support. I get why some people complain that Ingrid uses and recommends expensive products while other youtubers can use and rave about way more expensive products. It is because Ingrid's personality is humble, honest, and nice and she seems wiser than her peer; and that doesnt really fit into the category of luxury or consumerism. Like for example, some other youtubers talk about crazy expensive stuff but it fits them and their branding. However i dont think it is Ingrid's problem, it is people's expectation and their idea of Ingrid that make it hard for them to except that Ingrid has grown up and earned her the life she has now. and there is nothing wrong with that. \\n\\nYou may say it is also because her audience market doesnt need or want to know about expensive products. But i think those audience also follows other youtubers who have even more luxurious life styles. It is all about their expectations. \\n\\nBut Ingrid, if you are interested in keeping and growing your audience, you can focus more on your branding strategy now. Just saying. \\n\\nI get you and i always like you. Good day!",5,1

2Lq5pZrbpHc,"I really love all the Mormonts. they all are just such likable characters. Jeor and Jorah are both men who have pasts that weigh heavy on their minds, and how they act in the present. they aren't boastful, like many other great warriors from other houses, yet they are incredible fighters. Jeor clearly has great compassion for all the members of the nights watch, even the worst of them, treating them as his own both when giving affection and support and when punishment and disappointment. I like the Show's depiction of Jorah's fighting skills, yes, he'll get hit, and he isn't the is flawless superhuman, but has a seeming inability to give up. he preservers through the hardships, through getting the shit kicked out of him, because he knows he can take more than any he faces can give, and he has the motivation to keep pushing on. Lyanna is interesting, as she's the most boastful Mormont, but not in an arrogant way. She's proud of her people, home, and family and clearly has a deep love for them. she is also one of the most if not the most capable child-ruler we've seen on the show. she doesn't let adults bully her or control her as a puppet like Jeoffrey, Tommen, and Robin Aryn. She knows she must assert herself and make decisions on her own to avoid being trampled politically.  The Mormonts are an underrated house.",0,0

I guess the begged Samsung to let them use last years screen on their new phone.  LOL Samsung is now so rich they make the chips, the screens the cameras etc and give the competition the crappy versions.  Hmmm Guess whose phone will be better.  In what way is apple even an american company?  seems like a cheep china company that buys expesive stuff from samsung and oversells it to dumb americans and idiot girls who just can't wait to take a picture of their stink hole and send it to the world.  america - the country so screwed by leftist that they now think that bkacks were slaves and forget who that more blacks were slaveholders over history than anyone.  in fact, in africa today blacks still are slaves to other blacks.

She doesn't have acnes, her face glowing without looking oily. That means all those expensive masks worked and they are worth the money. Just freaking buy one high end mask and try to see if it works because it already worked for Ingrid. And if it worked for her, she would want to share to us so we can experience good things like her.

uZ8L6qLeC74,"Never really comment ever, but i always like Ingrid's personality and want to show some support. I get why some people complain that Ingrid uses and recommends expensive products while other youtubers can use and rave about way more expensive products. It is because Ingrid's personality is humble, honest, and nice and she seems wiser than her peer; and that doesnt really fit into the category of luxury or consumerism. Like for example, some other youtubers talk about crazy expensive stuff but it fits them and their branding. However i dont think it is Ingrid's problem, it is people's expectation and their idea of Ingrid that make it hard for them to except that Ingrid has grown up and earned her the life she has now. and there is nothing wrong with that. \\n\\nYou may say it is also because her audience market doesnt need or want to know about expensive products. But i think those audience also follows other youtubers who have even more luxurious life styles. It is all about their expectations. \\n\\nBut Ingrid, if you are interested in keeping and growing your audience, you can focus more on your branding strategy now. Just saying. \\n\\nI get you and i always like you. Good day!",5,1

Actually certain fables are the same as Aesop... Even i can call it for few of them plagiat because i saw the crow and the fox by Aesop and le corbeau et le renard literally The crow and the fox and it's THE SAME story, sadly it's the most popular fable from Jean De La Fontaine but when I know from whom it come from, I m a bit disappointed... And the fox in his stories is always the winner and the animal who fucks everyone by his words... Even if it's similar for this animal, Jean De La Fontaine made several fables on his own, some are really sad and others true and great morals, it's why La Fontaine is one of the most famous poet.",0,0

The first one was about boys vs girls, the second was about Americans vs Europeans, now this one is about a Capella vs normal music. I really can't wait for unfunny Rebel Wilson falling over and doing stupid shit because she doesn't have actual jokes. And don't forget the multicultural stereotypes of the group like the criminal Mexican, the quiet Chinese one, the European lady from the second one and don't forget the black lady who has no redeeming qualities except for the fact that she wants to fuck girls.

03jeumSTSzc,There is a very popular french fable explaining how the fox got the cheese. There was a parrot on a branch with a pice of cheese he was holding with his beak. The branch was to high up for the fox to reach so he decided to start complementing the parrot until the parrot aknowledged his existence and started bragging about himself. As soon as he opened his mouth the piece of cheese fell down. The fox told the fox that he should have never bragged and ran off with the cheese.

Most of the characters were based on characters from the first series....Spock was divided three ways between Worf, Data and the Psycho lady, Ryker was Kirk lite. The original Star Trek often had award-winning sci fi writers doing episodes whereas NG was essentially typical TV writers of the time period. The Psycho lady spent way too many times explaining why she ate chocolate whenever she was upset, Worf spent way too many times explaining Klingon culture and losing fights and how many times could Data sty something that had never worked before....but if the cosmic sub megaton defibrillator untensed the quantum flux hiccups at just the right intensity without waking up the giant space warthog, then it just might work and save the ship from an otherwise undefeatable threat? How many times was that card played? And I stillc irnge just thinking about Data with his emotion chip singing about life forms.",0,0

4AsSp0AhlBc,"I think that Will may not be an accidental agent exactly, in the sense that he might end up possessed or controlled by the upside-down.  But I think that maybe the part of the upside-down that stayed with him (the 'slugs' in his belly) might create a physical connection between the upside-down and our reality, a connection which would allow the two to cross over between one another.  Kind of like the doorway created by that government agency.",0,0

Kz-3PgnD1vM,Katy I have a bad immune system and I was supposed to see you on October 11th but I can’t cause I can get really sick. And I’m really upset. I saw you for your Prismatic World Tour and now I can probably not see you in concert. I have an auto immune disease that I’m always at doctors and I don’t have a normal life. I’m 14 and most of my life I’ve been sick or at doctors. And getting blood taking and getting infusions and shots every week. And I’m struggling to stay caught up in school and keep friends and deal with my auto immune disease that me and my brother and Mom have. Every time I’m upset I listen to your music cause it makes me happy and forget what I’m going through. And because I’m a DJ I always play your music. And I have trouble talking to people about what I go through and when I listen to your music when I’m upset or happy or at doctors or getting my infusions or just at a random time it always makes me happy. You are my role model and my favorite person in the whole world. I know you probably won’t see this but I hope you do and respond cause it would mean a lot to me. Thank you,1,0

lduyitPDQjY,"IMO should've explained cover VS concealment and their importance.\\n\\nConcealment: Obscures/hides an individual from an assailant. Can be virtually any type of physical barrier, a car, thin walls, or even bodies.\\n\\nCover: Protects an individual from the incoming projectiles.\\n\\nCover is preferable, but not always available, in such cases where it isn't concealment is a friend. It's much harder for a shooter to hit what they cannot see.\\n\\nAlso, while doors and trunks do not stop bullets, engines will. If you're seeking cover behind a vehicle preferably do it placing the engine between yourself and the shooter.\\n\\nOh and because it wasn't addressed here is the order of action in an active shooter situation:\\n\\nExit -> Cover/Concealment -> Fight",0,0

There are some people that may tune out of what you're trying to say if you don't give more interaction with your explanation.

I saw a car drive by fast as hell with four men looking sketchy as fuck, I made eye contact with them and was watching for guns. At this point I am running to get my dog to get out of there.

lduyitPDQjY,"I heard gunfire recently (April 2017) but I thought it was fireworks. Being lit about 40 or 50 yards away. Then I heard a guy yelling bloody murder, so I figured it must be a gun. And it was. Surprising how it sounded louder than a cherry bomb, but quieter than an M80. I suppose it would be good training for all American children to visit shooting ranges just so we can know what it sounds like. I still feel kinda dumb that I handled that life and death situation so cavalierly and just drove my car right over to where the bullets were flying. Yes, I had my car for cover, and never took it out of drive, but still.",0,0
lduyitPDQjY,Great video !

lduyitPDQjY,Can you please make another video further explaining how it sounds and looks like when someone is reloading so that the person hiding knows what the cue is to run or attack the shooter? How much time do I get to run in between reloads or is it even a good idea to run instead of attack?

My first thought was, I heard it so I'm not dead. My second thought was to keep cover on the mound of dirt in front of me and keep my eyes open looking for the shooter. I saw a car drive by fast as hell with four men looking sketchy as fuck, I made eye contact with them and was watching for guns. At this point I am running to get my dog to get out of there.

Can be virtually any type of physical barrier, a car, thin walls, or even bodies.\\n\\nCover: Protects an individual from the incoming projectiles.\\n\\nCover is preferable, but not always available, in such cases where it isn't concealment is a friend. It's much harder for a shooter to hit what they cannot see.\\n\\nAlso, while doors and trunks do not stop bullets, engines will. If you're seeking cover behind a vehicle preferably do it placing the engine between yourself and the shooter.\\n\\nOh and because it wasn't addressed here is the order of action in an active shooter situation:\\n\\nExit -> Cover/Concealment -> Fight",0,0

lduyitPDQjY,When you live in a nice neighborhood i can understand people not knowing what gun fire sounds like. The main different from fireworks and gun fire is how fast the sounds are together and fireworks tend to have a sound after the explosion like a sprinkle or a slow fade. From the footage it was obvious it was a automatic weapon after the 8 rounds went by so quickly. A shooter with a handgun will tend to use 4 or 8 rounds before pausing with a semiautomatic. Living in the hood i recognized the gun fire right away having come from the suburbs i had to train my ears,0,0

oh37J6qROrQ,Personally I would love it if you do a video showing and comparing a few sound options. E.g how does audio sound using regular corded in ear earphones over the provided dongle? Would buying a different dongle improve sound? How does audio over the dongle compare to audio from the 3.5mm jack on first pixel. Perhaps also test some native usbc headsets and Bluetooth options so we can get a better understanding of sound quality across the different options we now have.,0,0

oh37J6qROrQ,"Looks like a great phone, but let's be realistic, the squeeze is a gimmick, a ton of fast ways to get to assistant, a song's name coming up on screen off when your listening to the radio (without wanting to know) is nothing short of annoying, design is not good, dual speakers are excellent, will be the fastest android, but to say xyz is excellent = not true",0,0

oh37J6qROrQ,Did anyone else notice something strange at 3:09-3:10 with the blur that it applied in the third portrait shot where he was standing _behind_ the camera? It looks like it kept him in focus but blurred the camera out. :/ Technically both he and the camera should be in focus while everything in the background is blurred.

oh37J6qROrQ,Personally I would love it if you do a video showing and comparing a few sound options. E.g how does audio sound using regular corded in ear earphones over the provided dongle? Would buying a different dongle improve sound? How does audio over the dongle compare to audio from the 3.5mm jack on first pixel. Perhaps also test some native usbc headsets and Bluetooth options so we can get a better understanding of sound quality across the different options we now have.,0,0

YLM2gl8RGj0,"Loved the video!!!! But James I think, as a professional makeup artist, the biggest problem between Online Beauty Gurus and Makeup Artists is not that you're making money or talented. In fact, I get inspired from some beauty influencers. The problem is that some of your peers say they are Makeup Artists without putting in the time of being interns, getting disrespected, and learning how to take care of their models. So all in all my problem only comes when the title Makeup Artists is taken from us. Love you!!! Just wanted to clear up that me and my groups of professional muas don't hate beauty influencers. 😇💜💙💚💛❤️💜💙💚💛❤️💜💙💚💛❤️💜💙💚💚❤️💜💙💚💛❤️💛💚💙💜💙💚💛❤️💛💚💙💜",0,1

oh37J6qROrQ,Personally I would love it if you do a video showing and comparing a few sound options. E.g how does audio sound using regular corded in ear earphones over the provided dongle? Would buying a different dongle improve sound? How does audio over the dongle compare to audio from the 3.5mm jack on first pixel.

I also understand that this season may end in another cliff hanger.\\nIf I had my way, they would ALL be mythology episodes.  That's the main important story in my opinion and the monster episodes just feel like bottle episodes that aren't needed.  To me they are wasting too many episodes on that, when they should be focusing on the mythology; smoking man, aliens, government conspiracies, UFOs and so on.",0,0

IRdrt8nPyy8,"Jesus is coming back real soon. Jesus Loves U and he wants U to have a deep relationship with him and truly follow him. Following Jesus is the only way to make it to Heaven. Accept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour and give him your heart and soul. Jesus is the son of God who created us all, he is our Lord and Saviour. Jesus is God, he is one with the Father. (John 10:30) God sent Jesus to the Earth to die for our sins to be washed away so we could make it to Heaven. The Bible tells us that if we believe in Jesus we will be saved but there are other things Jesus told us we have to do to be saved. We have to do his will. \\nHere are the things we have to do to be saved and make it to Heaven. I'm gonna list the Bible scriptures for everything and U can read the scriptures yourself and do your own research.\\n1. We have to believe that Jesus is is the son of God and that he is our Lord and Saviour. (John 3:16)\\n2. We have to accept him as our Lord and Saviour and believe that God raised him from the dead. (Romans 10:9)\\n3. Repent from all our sins. (2 Chronicles 7:14)\\n4. Be baptized in the name of Jesus. (Acts 2:38)\\n5. We have to have a deep relationship with him and pray to him and talk to him everyday. The only way to the Father is thru him. (John 14:6)\\n6. Read the Bible and learn the word of God. (Joshua 1:8)\\n7. Fast and pray. (Joel 2:12)\\n8. Speak the word of God to the ppl of the world. (Mark 16:15)\\n9. Do the Lord's will until we die. (Matthew 24:13)\\nOn Judgement day when we go before Jesus there will be many ppl who have prayed to Jesus and even done things in his name and Jesus will say to them depart from me I never knew U and they will go to Hell. This is why We have to have a deep relationship with Jesus and try to do everything he told us to do cause thats the only way we will make it to Heaven. (Matthew 7:20-23). We all fall short of the Glory of God and we are all sinners. (Romans 3:23) This is why Jesus came and died for our sins to be washed away so we could make it to Heaven. (Peter 3:18) Without Jesus we are doomed to Hell. (John 3:36) When we disobey God and sin, God curses us. (Galatians 3:10) God punishes us and puts curses on us to make us obedient to him cause he Loves us and wants us to do right. (Hebrews 12:6) Jesus sets us free from curses when we truly follow him. (Romans 8:2) Quit following everything else in the world like the Government, religion, schools, science, TV, movies, radio, and everything else. (Colossians 2:8) That is all ran by the Devil and his worshippers, the Illuminati. They lie to U and deceive U. Them and the fallen Angels who got kicked out of Heaven with Satan are trying to lead U to Hell. (Ephesians 6:12) \\nPut God 1st in your life. Never put anyone or anything before God, not your family friends job money or anything. (Matthew 6:33) If U Love Jesus then U hate evil. (Proverbs 8:13) Repent from all your sins. Pray to Jesus everyday. Pray to him for everything U need. (John 15:7) Pray to him and ask for forgiveness of your sins, thank him for everything. (Philippians 4:6)  Pray to him to heal U, give U peace, joy, strength, courage, protection, wisdom, knowledge, understanding, patience, direction, guidance, and for him to show U the truth. (Jeremiah 33:3) Do the Lord's will and he will answer your prayers.  (John 9:31) God gives us visions and he talks to us in dreams and shows us things. (Acts 2:17) When U die U will go before Jesus and he will judge U and either let U into Heaven or send U to Hell based on if U did his will. Those who don't do the Lord's will they will be sent to Hell. (Revelation 20:15) Hell is place where ppl will be punished and burn for eternity (Matthew 25:46) Heaven is a place that God has for the ppl who truly Love him. It is eternal paradise where U will be wit Jesus, the Angels, all the animals, and God's ppl forever. God says there will be no more death, we will have eternal life. We will not feel sorrow, we will not cry, and there will be no more pain. (Revelation 21:4) God says that we can't even imagine how amazing Heaven will be. (1 Corinthians 2:9) In Heaven we live forever, rejoice and be joyful forever. (Revelations 22:1-5)",0,0

IRdrt8nPyy8,I didn't understood season 10.\nSeason 11 should explain what happened after the end of season 9.\nLike the end of season 9 the Aliens invaded Earth and Mulder and Scully were in an Apocalypse.\nBut in season 10 everything was normal and Scully has William.\nAnd William seemed to be a normal boy.\nAnd Scully was surprised to see a UFO.\nAnd the Cancer man is still alive after getting blown up in season 9?,0,0

IRdrt8nPyy8,By now we've all probably heard that GA is thinking of quitting after this season and yet while I've been with X files since the very very beginning a huge huge fan. I say this with no disrespect at all but I think she has never really been that keen on it all ( Please don't hate )\n\n Take Supernatural for example heading into season 13 Jensen and Jarred both love it and with GA I dunno feel like that she dosent really like it all that much.  \nShe dosent have the passion for it beacuse if she respected the show and fans she would continue an not bitch about things like this now and in the past. \n\nYes playing a character for years could get old but my point is if she did love the show one would think she would give any chance to come back again an not keep saying she wants to quit.  \nAgain back to  Supernatural both of them guy's have said many times they want more and more and you can literally tell the love what they do and there huge fan base where as for GA it seems shes not that thrilled about the whole thing. \n\nPlease don't hate me on this only saying and I mean no disrespect thank you,0,0

That’s what they get for jumping the gun and attempting to create a whole Marvel-like cinematic universe in two movies. They even blew their load too soon within the movies themselves! Introducing Batman without establishing him first in his own standalone film? Killing off Superman in literally the second film in the franchise? And those are not even the numerous “smaller” mistakes, like casting Jessie Eisenberg as Lex Luthor “Jr” or Jared Letto as the Joker. Haha they could have literally just cast Jessie as the Joker and he would have been fine! Also, how about the infamous “Martha” scene?

h2K_SWpQtb4,The new Stephen A Smith of soccer 🤣⚽️,59,2
h2K_SWpQtb4,This guy looks like Joe hart,18,1
h2K_SWpQtb4,"Look at Jozy Altidore's Career, this pretty much sums up American Soccer.. \\n\\nIn England - 70 Games - 2 Goals\\nIn United States - 109 Games - 51 Goals\\n\\nAs you can see, when Altidore played in the most competitive league in the world he failed miserably and is considered one of the worst Premier League strikers of all time. When he moves to the MLS he starts scoring goals for fun, coincidence? I think not. The problem is the MLS is of an incredibly poor standard. Your players aren't good enough to play with the elite players in Europe, hence why the majority of USMNT still play in the MLS. Only a handful of players have been successful in Europe.",9,2
h2K_SWpQtb4,"He's wrong that USA has better resources than Mexico, liga mx is infinitely better than mls, concacaf champions league has been won by only Mexican teams and saprissa from Costa Rica.",28,9
h2K_SWpQtb4,you cant compare womens soccer to the men. Men soccer is miles and miles ahead of the women's game,6,2
h2K_SWpQtb4,USA are shit at football. No surprise to anyone outside of the USA that they didn't qualify. And Taylor Twellman was a nobody.,11,0
h2K_SWpQtb4,MLS needs relegation,8,2
h2K_SWpQtb4,I am Mexican but it's a f****** shame that the United States didn't pass f****** unbelievable I actually lost 300 f****** dollars what's wrong with this f****** Team USA,0,0
h2K_SWpQtb4,"Always thought US men’s team sucked at soccer so I wasn’t surprised, in fact I am actually surprised that the team went to the World Cup every opportunity since 86 until now. Would have been surprised if the women’s team missed it. They can play.\\n\\nIf anyone is surprised the men’s team didn’t make it I also don’t understand how. Especially if they didn’t play well to deserve it.",0,0
h2K_SWpQtb4,Lol Americans only like sports their good at,0,0
h2K_SWpQtb4,"Finally, someone asked the question I've been asking and studying for years now: What are the women doing right? This is why: if everything in US Soccer is so bad, and we're not doing anything right here, our women shouldn't be dominating the way they are. So in spite of little girls having to play with boys growing up because there weren't girls leagues (all my recreational teams until high school were co-ed), in spite of the absence of a strong (or even existent) women's domestic league, they are STILL putting together teams that can dominate on the international level. That's against the run of play as they say in England LoL. Because the alleged failures of the FA isn't hindering them from finding good players and literally establishing an assembly line of players that can come in every 4-8 years and achieve the same successful results as the generation before them. I'm not even mentioning the clearly defined formation and effective style of play, people can't handle it LoL. It's NOT gender specific because 10 years ago Germany remodeled their system to accomplish exactly what our women have done. Spain's been doing it, Japan's been doing it with the men AND women (World Cup 2011 winners I rest my case), Belgium is working on it. So I say, why look at these other countries when all we have to do is look next door? But we won't, because all I keep hearing is they're women, it's not as tough for them, there's no pressure on them, our men are better than the women simply because they're stronger and faster apparently. I'd take Alex Morgan or Abby Wambach over Jozy Altidore any day. Their individual numbers are the female equivalent of Wayne Rooney's in the men's game, but there's NOTHING we can learn from them because they're women?? Sorry, that's ridiculous to me and I'm a guy.",0,0

h2K_SWpQtb4,I think the style of American soccer is really not that good and a huge part of that is player development. There is no creativity and no flair in American soccer with it's players. The exception is Pulisic who is a world class talent at such a young age. There a few other players who merit playing in the national team but at most maybe 5 have the quality to be on the national team roster. MLS is a huge part of player development but they fail because they want to Americanize soccer and make it like the NFL or NBA. If the MLS sacrificed their revenue for player development by adding promotion and relegation more talent would definitely be discovered. The fact is a lot of USL and NASL teams are capable and have beaten MLS teams and that there says a lot about the quality of the MLS and is also a reason for promotion and relegation to be added. But this is America where all they care about is money and they bring in old European talents past their prime to add attention to the league instead of making changes that will help in finding and developing homegrown talent.,2,1

Rest of the world sucks at it because nobody cares. with the men its the other way around almost every nation can play some football, except the US and some others like China. \\ni am german and the reason for our women to be somewhat decent is they get money from men's football. in the highest league for men there are 30000 in attendance on average, highest women league, 200 on average no joke. if the men wouldnt pay we would have no professional women league, they would need real Jobs, because no revenue. and football would be a hobby and we would suck like almost everyone.\\ndon't know how it is in brazil Sweden and Japan but i think it is the same. the  US league may be the only self- sufficient female football league in the whole world , if IT is i dont know.",0,1

CdHV7Uzw2E4,"I have to explain this to my friends soooo many time but I think It helps.\\n50mm lens is a 50mm lens, no matter which format of sensor it goes with.\\n50mm lens equipped in a crop body is just a 50mm lens shoot with a fullframe body and then you crop the image. Foreground / background you captured in the frame have no difference in ratio (same perspective), depth of field is exactly the same with the same setup (aperture, focus length)\\n50mm lens in a crop body gives you better magnification with the same aperture/price ratio (lol), makes it better for sport/ outdoor (good lighting) activity (when your budget is tight). You paid for more pixel per inch of your sensor for that, and deal with noise cancelling problem.\\nbut 50mm lens in a fullfrane body gives you better depth of field manipulation, better back ground blur (same magnification at close focal setup) and better angle of view. bigger the sensor, more light comming in, better noise cancelling, worse bills for tele lens with fast aperture (sad) :(\\nwith people doing non-professional photograph or videograph, they can somehow consider 50mm lens on crop body is a 85mm with no other problems \\ney sorry for my english.

r9-DM9uBtVI,"*Reasons why Justice League will be successful (if they at least have a decent storyline);*\\n1. Justice League is the epitome of a superhero team up. The alpha team in comicbook history. This is not just a movie. It's a historic event.\\n\\n2. This movie builds up and ends on a triumphant note (different from Batman v Superman which was a movie about internal struggles with an atmosphere shrouded in angst) \\n\\n3. Rebirth of Superman (him largely missing in the marketing campaign will boost the level of anticipation, making his entry even more epic)\\n\\n4. It's not a copy of the first avengers movie and has it's own unique signature.\\n\\n5. Success of the Wonder Woman movie and the presence of Wonder Woman in this movie.\\n\\n6. Team dynamic looks great and will be a major selling point\\n\\n7. Seemingly menacing villain \\n\\n8. More Thermyscira and Amazonians for the Wonder Woman fanbase and the introduction to Atlantis (the underwater kingdom will be a unique cinematic experience)\\n\\n9. DCEU has a great track record with soundtracks and cinematography. These aspects will elevate the level of energy and epicness",1,0

r9-DM9uBtVI,"I like how DC is starting to really compete with Marvel. Ever since Iron Man, Marvel has dominated even though DC had Nolan's Batman series. But clearly Marvel had a plan and a narrative in which they would carry out their universe over the next 10-20 years whereas DC wasnt really doing that much and they were almost non existent. Now that DC actually has a timeline and direction for the franchise Marvel will have to make sure they can stay on top. DC arent just focusing on Individual movies anymore, and Marvel is somewhat nearing the end of their own timeline. Now DC can focus on trying to take over and they have a good chance of doing it too.",0,3

When he moves to the MLS he starts scoring goals for fun, coincidence? I think not. The problem is the MLS is of an incredibly poor standard. Your players aren't good enough to play with the elite players in Europe, hence why the majority of USMNT still play in the MLS. Only a handful of players have been successful in Europe.",16,4

h2K_SWpQtb4,"This guy is taking this really personal. I don't know much about soccer, but I was really surprised that the US didn't get in. I think he's right, because in other US Teams of other sports, what did they do? They looked at the program, brought the best players, coaches and made it happened. Look at basketball, baseball, and other sports. Baseball Classic...those guys showed up with a mission and they delivered. Basketball, that's another story because the US continues to own everyone.",0,1
h2K_SWpQtb4,"Talking about accountability, anyone remember what happened to the Nigerian men's team when they had a humiliating early exit from the 2010 world cup? The then Nigerian President issued a 2 year ban on the team. Some of the players were told not to return home. I'm not saying it's the right thing to do but it goes to show how important the game is. During world cup games, the streets and even major roads are empty; no buses, taxis, or people. Everyone is either at their homes, friend's or neighbor's houses, or the nearest pubs. It's just that important. We need that here in the US.",0,0

h2K_SWpQtb4,"Finally, someone asked the question I've been asking and studying for years now: What are the women doing right? This is why: if everything in US Soccer is so bad, and we're not doing anything right here, our women shouldn't be dominating the way they are. So in spite of little girls having to play with boys growing up because there weren't girls leagues (all my recreational teams until high school were co-ed), in spite of the absence of a strong (or even existent) women's domestic league, they are STILL putting together teams that can dominate on the international level. That's against the run of play as they say in England LoL. Because the alleged failures of the FA isn't hindering them from finding good players and literally establishing an assembly line of players that can come in every 4-8 years and achieve the same successful results as the generation before them. I'm not even mentioning the clearly defined formation and effective style of play, people can't handle it LoL. It's NOT gender specific because 10 years ago Germany remodeled their system to accomplish exactly what our women have done. Spain's been doing it, Japan's been doing it with the men AND women (World Cup 2011 winners I rest my case), Belgium is working on it. So I say, why look at these other countries when all we have to do is look next door? But we won't, because all I keep hearing is they're women, it's not as tough for them, there's no pressure on them, our men are better than the women simply because they're stronger and faster apparently. I'd take Alex Morgan or Abby Wambach over Jozy Altidore any day. Their individual numbers are the female equivalent of Wayne Rooney's in the men's game, but there's NOTHING we can learn from them because they're women?? Sorry, that's ridiculous to me and I'm a guy.",0,1

CdHV7Uzw2E4,But 50mm is always 50mm regardless of your sensor size.  It's only the field of view that changes.\n\nGreat lens though. Use mine all the time.,0,0
CdHV7Uzw2E4,"I have to explain this to my friends soooo many time but I think It helps.\\n50mm lens is a 50mm lens, no matter which format of sensor it goes with.\\n50mm lens equipped in a crop body is just a 50mm lens shoot with a fullframe body and then you crop the image. Foreground / background you captured in the frame have no difference in ratio (same perspective), depth of field is exactly the same with the same setup (aperture, focus length)\\n50mm lens in a crop body gives you better magnification with the same aperture/price ratio (lol), makes it better for sport/ outdoor (good lighting) activity (when your budget is tight). You paid for more pixel per inch of your sensor for that, and deal with noise cancelling problem.\\nbut 50mm lens in a fullfrane body gives you better depth of field manipulation, better back ground blur (same magnification at close focal setup) and better angle of view. bigger the sensor, more light comming in, better noise cancelling, worse bills for tele lens with fast aperture (sad) :(\\nwith people doing non-professional photograph or videograph, they can somehow consider 50mm lens on crop body is a 85mm with no other problems \\ney sorry for my english. You are the best, Pete. Inspired me when I need to be inspired. Keep it up <3",0,0
CdHV7Uzw2E4,Is that the nifty fifty?,0,0
CdHV7Uzw2E4,"You forgot that you have to multiply the f-stop value with the crop factor of the sensor.

CdHV7Uzw2E4,"The 1.6 crop gets hated on so much, but it's basically the size of super 35 film in motion pictures. So most of the movies you've seen since the 50's have used that field of view. Many cinematographers use the 50mm for standard medium shots. So don't think you can't make amazing images with a crop sensor. Especially with how good these sensors have gotten recently. \\n\\nPeter is right though, it's a great lens.

Even if life can be hard at times, everything will always get better since giving up is not an option as we work through the worst, not losing hope and remain strong each time, just like on how we LGBTQ community keep on fighting for our rights and acceptance and those with mental health issues coming to terms with it and work on coping with it or at the very least, we focus on the positive and what makes us happy to make with help from our loved ones us feel better :)",0,0

I'm not saying that you are bipolar but I am saying that if you see a pattern in your emotion then maybe talk to someone that can help you know? Especially if everything in your life is going well. IF there is an imbalance in your body then it helps to have a professional to talk to about it or even take medicine if it is necessary (not that medicine should ever be a first choice). But anyway I hope you feel better hun.,0,0

The same organs of democracy turn around and get angry when they are struck for supporting and funding State terrorism (United States gives Israeli $38 billion a year knowing very well that money goes to supporting more illegal settlements, funding IDF (Israeli Defense Force) that murders our family, and breaks international law and laws of the United Nations yet, not a single coalition is created to stop them. Now, this is very shameful of Hollywood who claims to support democracy, women's rights, and an end to genocide but they are promoting Gal Gadot, a person who killed before, worked with IDF, and is a state terrorist.",0,2

h2K_SWpQtb4,My Opinion ranking sports in the States\n1.NFL\n2.NBA\n3.MLB\n4.NHL\n5.MLS.\n\nBut I do agree soccer has gotten bigger here but in terms of turning on your local TV and seeing MLS being played nope your more likely to see Arsenal or Manchester United playing in the UK.,3,0
h2K_SWpQtb4,It will be a very long time to rebuild the USMNT. Also it starts at home and they system they have now in schools are ass backwards in so many ways. I see parents fight with coaches because their child didn't get to play but its because the child didn't work hard enough or hit its limit to reach the level that the coach is looking for.\n\nSo when yo have like that it builds entitlements instead of earning spots. That generation will be there for a long time and I see the USA going no where because they don't have that drive to be hungry enough and they are fine with that.,0,0

USA brazil germany Sweden and Japan, that's it. Rest of the world sucks at it because nobody cares. with the men its the other way around almost every nation can play some football, except the US and some others like China. \\ni am german and the reason for our women to be somewhat decent is they get money from men's football. in the highest league for men there are 30000 in attendance on average, highest women league, 200 on average no joke. if the men wouldnt pay we would have no professional women league, they would need real Jobs, because no revenue. and football would be a hobby and we would suck like almost everyone.\\ndon't know how it is in brazil Sweden and Japan but i think it is the same. the  US league may be the only self- sufficient female football league in the whole world , if IT is i dont know.",2,1

h2K_SWpQtb4,"Finally, someone asked the question I've been asking and studying for years now: What are the women doing right? This is why: if everything in US Soccer is so bad, and we're not doing anything right here, our women shouldn't be dominating the way they are. So in spite of little girls having to play with boys growing up because there weren't girls leagues (all my recreational teams until high school were co-ed), in spite of the absence of a strong (or even existent) women's domestic league, they are STILL putting together teams that can dominate on the international level. That's against the run of play as they say in England LoL. Because the alleged failures of the FA isn't hindering them from finding good players and literally establishing an assembly line of players that can come in every 4-8 years and achieve the same successful results as the generation before them. I'm not even mentioning the clearly defined formation and effective style of play, people can't handle it LoL. It's NOT gender specific because 10 years ago Germany remodeled their system to accomplish exactly what our women have done. Spain's been doing it, Japan's been doing it with the men AND women (World Cup 2011 winners I rest my case), Belgium is working on it. So I say, why look at these other countries when all we have to do is look next door? But we won't, because all I keep hearing is they're women, it's not as tough for them, there's no pressure on them, our men are better than the women simply because they're stronger and faster apparently. I'd take Alex Morgan or Abby Wambach over Jozy Altidore any day. Their individual numbers are the female equivalent of Wayne Rooney's in the men's game, but there's NOTHING we can learn from them because they're women?? Sorry, that's ridiculous to me and I'm a guy.",0,1

I think he's right, because in other US Teams of other sports, what did they do? They looked at the program, brought the best players, coaches and made it happened. Look at basketball, baseball, and other sports. Baseball Classic...those guys showed up with a mission and they delivered. Basketball, that's another story because the US continues to own everyone.",0,1
h2K_SWpQtb4,"Talking about accountability, anyone remember what happened to the Nigerian men's team when they had a humiliating early exit from the 2010 world cup? The then Nigerian President issued a 2 year ban on the team. Some of the players were told not to return home. I'm not saying it's the right thing to do but it goes to show how important the game is. During world cup games, the streets and even major roads are empty; no buses, taxis, or people. Everyone is either at their homes, friend's or neighbor's houses, or the nearest pubs. It's just that important. We need that here in the US.",0,1

Foreground / background you captured in the frame have no difference in ratio (same perspective), depth of field is exactly the same with the same setup (aperture, focus length)\\n50mm lens in a crop body gives you better magnification with the same aperture/price ratio (lol), makes it better for sport/ outdoor (good lighting) activity (when your budget is tight). You paid for more pixel per inch of your sensor for that, and deal with noise cancelling problem.\\nbut 50mm lens in a fullfrane body gives you better depth of field manipulation, better back ground blur (same magnification at close focal setup) and better angle of view. bigger the sensor, more light comming in, better noise cancelling, worse bills for tele lens with fast aperture (sad) :(\\nwith people doing non-professional photograph or videograph, they can somehow consider 50mm lens on crop body is a 85mm with no other problems \\ney sorry for my english.

h2K_SWpQtb4,"A few things to ponder, first off from my personal experience theres a lot of talent that is far overlooked young soccer players who don't go to college basically end up quitting soccer because of the lack of opportunity so that talent goes to waste also I've noticed many coaches and players focus a significant amount of time on the athletic aspect of the game which is a good thing however U.S soccer lacks the understanding of how to play the game i think most just simply don't get it. the U.S soccer has to stop looking so much for players who play in clubs in these rich clubs and focus some of that scouting on street soccer players where in my opinion thats how you truly learn to play the beautiful game.",0,0

h2K_SWpQtb4,"Taylor Twellman, you was at the forefront of those complaining against the German-American players that Klingsman brought in. If Jermain Jones was playing  this game  I am absolutely convinced the USA would have won. The USA can have one of the best teams in the world as soon as they start getting the same guys that play basketball and football to play soccer. You will never have a decent enough team if you narrow your options to suburbia! Karma is something else. I hope you guys wake up and smell the coffee. Start building soccer fields in Brooklyn and Chicago and California and setup tournaments the same way the basketball and football guys do it and hopefully in 16 years or so we will begin to turn this ship around.",0,0

USA brazil germany Sweden and Japan, that's it. Rest of the world sucks at it because nobody cares. with the men its the other way around almost every nation can play some football, except the US and some others like China. \\ni am german and the reason for our women to be somewhat decent is they get money from men's football. in the highest league for men there are 30000 in attendance on average, highest women league, 200 on average no joke. if the men wouldnt pay we would have no professional women league, they would need real Jobs, because no revenue. and football would be a hobby and we would suck like almost everyone.\\ndon't know how it is in brazil Sweden and Japan but i think it is the same. the  US league may be the only self- sufficient female football league in the whole world , if IT is i dont know.",4,2

This is why: if everything in US Soccer is so bad, and we're not doing anything right here, our women shouldn't be dominating the way they are. So in spite of little girls having to play with boys growing up because there weren't girls leagues (all my recreational teams until high school were co-ed), in spite of the absence of a strong (or even existent) women's domestic league, they are STILL putting together teams that can dominate on the international level. That's against the run of play as they say in England LoL. Because the alleged failures of the FA isn't hindering them from finding good players and literally establishing an assembly line of players that can come in every 4-8 years and achieve the same successful results as the generation before them. I'm not even mentioning the clearly defined formation and effective style of play, people can't handle it LoL. It's NOT gender specific because 10 years ago Germany remodeled their system to accomplish exactly what our women have done. Spain's been doing it, Japan's been doing it with the men AND women (World Cup 2011 winners I rest my case), Belgium is working on it. So I say, why look at these other countries when all we have to do is look next door? But we won't, because all I keep hearing is they're women, it's not as tough for them, there's no pressure on them, our men are better than the women simply because they're stronger and faster apparently. I'd take Alex Morgan or Abby Wambach over Jozy Altidore any day. Their individual numbers are the female equivalent of Wayne Rooney's in the men's game, but there's NOTHING we can learn from them because they're women?? Sorry, that's ridiculous to me and I'm a guy.",0,1

A man tortured, raped, and then killed & dismembered some children?  Why should we worry about his rights?  We shouldn’t.  We should administer to him, the scariest, mind bending drugs, like that E-103 stuff they mentioned, see what it does, then if he’s not brain dead, feed him a double dose for breakfast.  And  put him in a room with just scariest shit ever playing on every wall.  I’d pay good money to watch that.  And then the next dude that took an AK-47 into a mall & shot everybody up, take him and see what you could transplant onto or into him, till he dies, but try like hell to keep him alive and feeling every second.  And so on and so on.  It would get us the data we need, teach these assholes the lesson of their lives, & give sadistic criminals something to think about.   That’s it though.

8oyf8Ecwo-Y,"This trailer seems promising, because it seems to be following the books pretty closely. \\n\\nOne secret wish:  I hope they don't throw in some shoehorned in romance between Sarah and one of the male leads (like John or Marcus Isaacson.) In addition to being kinda pointless, a key part of Sarah's characterization in the books was that she was a woman in the 1890's (still technically the Victorian Era) who wasn't interested in men or romance; but preferred to focus on her career. At one point in the sequel, she comments how society has made her feel stigmatized as unnatural and an odd spinster lady and less than a woman due to the fact that she is pursuing her career rather than marriage and motherhood. If they show her falling in love with and/ or embarking on a sexual relationship with one of her male costars, I think that this aspect of her characterization will be very much damaged. \\n\\nI'm not denigrating men or romance as anti feminist; but Sarah's decision to eschew marriage for her career and how society's negative reaction to this makes her feel like an outsider is a key aspect of her characterization. As Kreitzler notes (about Sarah), She told me from the beginning that she wouldn't be interested in romance with me or anyone else. She is an unusual sort of woman; she doesn't need to be with a man. \\n\\nAnyway, I hope they remain as true as possible to her characterization. It looks as though they are portraying her well here-- intelligent, competent, and assertive, like in the books.  However, having a female protagonist who does not get together with at least one of the male leads is virtually unprecedented in Hollywood, which is what is making me nervous.",0,0

xTyTQgb-y-A,My favorite Dance of the night I think Jordan is going to give Lindsay her first Mirrorball,52,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,Sometimes I just want to pinch Jordan's cheeks!😂\nThis dance is phenomenal! So glad they got to use Jordan's vocals.,43,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,"His song, his dance! Totally deserved that score :) of course  Lindsay is doing a awesome job!",50,3
xTyTQgb-y-A,I love how they still have enough content to the point where you could recognize that it is a Foxtrot and added a lil youthful spin to it while still keeping it clean and cut and straight to the point,58,1
xTyTQgb-y-A,"I actually liked the breakdown. I thought it made the routine fresh and fun. I also want to say how happy I am that he received the first perfect score of the season. Say all the nasty things you want about Jordan, but the guy has no ballroom experience and he's very humble. He wants to win not for himself, but for Lindsay and for that, I applaud him. He deserves this so much",116,9
xTyTQgb-y-A,love their partnership!! Lindsay - flawless choreo as usual!,30,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,"To be perfectly honest, Jordan's charisma had me at its mercy by week two. Add to that his humility, off the charts chemistry with Lindsey, Lindsey's choreo, and his weekly improvement....these guys have got to win.",21,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,"Awesome dance, perfect score well deserved. Also Jordan’s vocal range is incredible. I really hope they win this season.",28,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,This was probably my favorite dance I’ve ever seen on this show!! Just amazing. Jordan for the win!!,23,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,"This was hands down the BEST dance of the night everything from the song,the breakdown in the middle,etc. Jordan is such a natural when performing that its looks like a pro performance every time he hits the floor🙌",97,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,These two are unstoppable!!! I think we are looking at the winners!!! (Fingers crossed),69,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,I love it I love it I love it!!!!,15,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,Len overlooked the middle part that's how GOOD he is. By far best dancer this season and one of the best ever,10,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,I find this hilarious because Jordan is technically a former Disney star and he got a perfect score on Disney night dancing to a song from a Disney movie’s soundtrack that he recorded (it wasn’t in the movie but came with the album and was sung like this),9,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,"Please dont take for granted that they are gonna win just because he is great at dancing, we already know that great dancers are eliminated please vote for them if you want them to win",9,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,Ugh the fact that they used his vocals made me so happy,13,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,"It'll be pretty crazy if he doesn't win, he's so talented.",9,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,He's such an amazing dancer without any ballroom experience and him getting the first perfect score is amazing. The dance was such a smooth and fun one and had to be my favourite one of the night,13,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,Jordan is definitely in a class of his own.  He never ceases to amaze me.,11,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,"I liked in some parts Jordan was lip syncing to the song. Luv it. Btw for those who complain that he dances so it's unfair. It's really not.  Remember Alfonso, he was blamed too. He won and his Broadway experience is closer to ballroom than Jordan's hip hop. Stop hating. 😘",31,1
xTyTQgb-y-A,this was BRILLIANT !!!,6,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,"I think this is Lindsay's year! So amazing, and SO GLAD they got the first perfect score! And the best part is that both of them contribute equally to the partnership. Jordan contributes his charisma and skill, and Lindsay contributes her killer choreography and both of them keep the chemistry hot!",5,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,"I love the fact that he’s dancing to his own song, well technically Lin’s song, but he sings this version with Lin.",6,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,"This was so fantastic!!! Jordan sure never fails to amaze me!! Him, Lindsey and Frankie r the best dances of the night. All of them deserved 10’s in my book.",8,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,WHAT CAN I SAAYYY EXCEPT THIS WAS AMAZING?! Well deserved perfect score! :)),9,1

xTyTQgb-y-A,Best dance of the night,4,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,Don't forget to vote for Jordan and Lindsay... no Disney child has ever won the show.  I loved this dance!,4,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,"I would say him, Frankie, and Lindsey will be the top 3.",30,2
xTyTQgb-y-A,"Lindsey Stirling is amazing in her own way, but Jordan Fisher adds something different and special in his dances.❤️He also continues to step it up and bring it every week.💪🏼👌🏼Rooting for Jordan Fisher and Lindsay Arnold to win!  #TeamFishUponAStar🐠💫🙏🏼",9,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,Nothing but respect for MY season 25 winners.,12,0

xTyTQgb-y-A,Jordan and Lindsay complement one another like two pros! Technique and choreography on point. They look great together too!,1,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,"Aside from lovvinggg Jordan's song initially I realllyyy loved this piece. You can see it in the way he moves ... he loves being creative and expressive. Whether through dance, song or otherwise. I'll call it now - I sense a clothing line in the future. Idk why but he is so artistically inclined",1,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,One of my favourite couple in all the DWTS's history!,2,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,I loveeee the fact that Jordan is dancing to his own song (with the amazing LMM). :D,2,0

xTyTQgb-y-A,Jesus how have I not heard of Lindsay Arnold or Witney Carson??? :0,0,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,"I love the way he uses his arms, so much fluidity, and the synchronicity in the breakdown was amazing!!!!!!!",0,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,"If the foxtrot and the contemporary were to have an offspring, this style of dance would be it. This was such a cool interpretation of a classical and sophisticated ballroom dance. I've never seen anything like it before. Lets all take a minute and bow down to Lindsay's choreography and Jordan's impeccable execution! That performance was insane! I didn't think Len was going to jump on board because of the breakdown but I was wrong; they won him over. Wow! Just, wow! #TeamFishUponAStar for the win! 95% of my votes went to them (the rest went to Drew). #Perfect30! :)",0,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,This guy has dance experience. He's a trained dancer. Where is the outage like there was with Normani. Oh yeah! I forgot he's a guy and he doesn't threaten the confidence of middle aged white women who watch this show.,0,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,"Jordan has so much charisma! Add to that his natural dance ability, Lindsay's amazing routines and her fabulous dancing also... I have high hopes to see these two get that MIRRORBALL !! Lindsay definitely deserves it!!!!",0,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,Best dance of the night!  So unique and fun.  They have great chemistry together.  i would so love to see him dance to Hamilton too.,0,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,if this didnt get a perfect score I would have pulled my hair out,0,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,"He's a natural performer for sure. His frame, rise and fall, fluidity, and foot work are just neat! Even some professional dancers can't dance so naturally like he does. Some may say he has more advantages having dance training before but if you watch SYTYCD, you know that it's not true at all. Some contestants, despite their strong dancing background in their genre, suffer difficulty in learning unfamiliar styles in short amount of time.",0,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,I'm so pleased with my favorite couple! Go Team JorLin!,0,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,"Very, very smooth, terrific musicality, flawless footwork, it was really, really a wonderful foxtrot. I would have love to see a little bit more sway, but it was definitely the best dance of the night. Great posture, great musicality, great hold, great footwork and great performance - all of that came together beautifully in this number. A 9.",0,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,Why do I have this weird feeling that he's going to be cheated this season? He deserves to win but I see him coming in second place if he's up against Lindsey in the the end and I'm already expecting Jordan And Lindsey to be the two finalists this season. It just feels like Lindsey & Mark has a bigger following and is more talked about than him and Lindsay are but I think he's the better dancer in my opinion.,0,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,"Last week, perfect score 29. And this week another perfect score 30!!! Yayyyy!!!! I can't believe it! Jordan & Lindsay it's wonderful lucky for the #DWTS25.",11,1
xTyTQgb-y-A,"There is no stopping Jordan and Lindsay.  If they don’t win, there is something wrong.",4,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,Jordan is so good!! Honestly feel like he outdanced Lindsay in certain parts of the routine,1,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,I feel at times Jordan outshined Lindsay ... lol 😳,0,0

xTyTQgb-y-A,This is good but it will not beat Simone and Sasha’s Moana dance last season,1,1

Besides morals, what will stop them realistically? Mean.... they have a tendency to ignore there own Rulings, or have convenient loop holes n' stuff (or simply have black projects, cough, you know American scientists were working on bio-organic weapons? like resident evil but use devices in the head to directly control muscle movements, and to see how effective it was on the native peoples around Vietnam, they simply inserted explosives and antagonized the peoples, attaching tattoos so that they would relate them to supernatural beings, covering there tracks and eventually detonating the poor soul that was being manipulated. Not mind control, but body control, surely you know certan impulses in the right part of the brain moves you about right?)\\n\\nNasty stuff.",0,0

IDXBKvaoXHc,"I  think the fact that we torture & perform cruel experiments on innocent animals is even more disturbing & unconscionable!! Animals have no voice & cannot consent to anything, yet they are treated like inanimate objects or trash on a daily basis. Whether they are discarded by drowning alive, or confined, trapped, and forced to live in cramped, inhumane, diseased living conditions, or skinned alive for fur & fashion, limbs amputated, electrocuted anally for fur, brutally clubbed to death or probed & prodded in the most barbaric fashion...all without anesthesia...in the name of fashion, medical experimentation, curiosity, or whatever human justifications are given. Sure, It's horrible that innocent humans have also been subjected to such horrors. But human indifference to the suffering of animals is the most heinous in my opinion...extending the callousness and violence to other humans is simply a logical progression in human evolution, the next step based on a species' collateral apathy and lack of respect for life in general, and desensitization to the pain and feelings of other living beings.",1,0

IDXBKvaoXHc,"You know... the worse part about the Japanese Unit 731 was, most of those directly involved, avoided any form of punishment.

Great job on the dance! However i do believe that Linsey Stirling should have gotten at least 2 tens as well, i love both teams, so i dont know which one is going to win 😩",5,2

And i also have the number that i call to vote for him, he's doing really good and im so happy for him, DWTS BETTER NOT FUCK THIS UP! and if he doesn't win, they should at least give the trophy to someone that can actually dance, (no shade to last season's winner)",0,0

The judges didn't like the long Breakdown, but that's not jordan's fault technically. He didn't choreograph this. And besides, his technique was so good, that even LEN was impressed.

She has the luxury of knowing she can throw anything at him and he'll nail it like a pro. The sky is the limit and we're looking at season 25's champion. Mark my word. #TeamFishUponAStar :)",1,0
xTyTQgb-y-A,"So immensely proud of Jordan, having been a fan of him for 3 years ago being in contact with him several times over twitter, I'm so proud of both his dancing, but most of all, dancing to his own song! JORDAN AND LINDSAY TO WIN! Watching from the UK",2,0

8oyf8Ecwo-Y,"This trailer seems promising, because it seems to be following the books pretty closely. \\n\\nOne secret wish:  I hope they don't throw in some shoehorned in romance between Sarah and one of the male leads (like John or Marcus Isaacson.) In addition to being kinda pointless, a key part of Sarah's characterization in the books was that she was a woman in the 1890's (still technically the Victorian Era) who wasn't interested in men or romance; but preferred to focus on her career. At one point in the sequel, she comments how society has made her feel stigmatized as unnatural and an odd spinster lady and less than a woman due to the fact that she is pursuing her career rather than marriage and motherhood. If they show her falling in love with and/ or embarking on a sexual relationship with one of her male costars, I think that this aspect of her characterization will be very much damaged. \\n\\nI'm not denigrating men or romance as anti feminist; but Sarah's decision to eschew marriage for her career and how society's negative reaction to this makes her feel like an outsider is a key aspect of her characterization. As Kreitzler notes (about Sarah), She told me from the beginning that she wouldn't be interested in romance with me or anyone else. She is an unusual sort of woman; she doesn't need to be with a man. \\n\\nAnyway, I hope they remain as true as possible to her characterization. It looks as though they are portraying her well here-- intelligent, competent, and assertive, like in the books.  However, having a female protagonist who does not get together with at least one of the male leads is virtually unprecedented in Hollywood, which is what is making me nervous.",4,0

8oyf8Ecwo-Y,No joke: I thought this was a trailer for a show about aliens.,11,1
8oyf8Ecwo-Y,"This trailer seems promising, because it seems to be following the books pretty closely. \\n\\nOne secret wish:  I hope they don't throw in some shoehorned in romance between Sarah and one of the male leads (like John or Marcus Isaacson.) In addition to being kinda pointless, a key part of Sarah's characterization in the books was that she was a woman in the 1890's (still technically the Victorian Era) who wasn't interested in men or romance; but preferred to focus on her career. At one point in the sequel, she comments how society has made her feel stigmatized as unnatural and an odd spinster lady and less than a woman due to the fact that she is pursuing her career rather than marriage and motherhood. If they show her falling in love with and/ or embarking on a sexual relationship with one of her male costars, I think that this aspect of her characterization will be very much damaged. \\n\\nI'm not denigrating men or romance as anti feminist; but Sarah's decision to eschew marriage for her career and how society's negative reaction to this makes her feel like an outsider is a key aspect of her characterization. As Kreitzler notes (about Sarah), She told me from the beginning that she wouldn't be interested in romance with me or anyone else. She is an unusual sort of woman; she doesn't need to be with a man. \\n\\nAnyway, I hope they remain as true as possible to her characterization. It looks as though they are portraying her well here-- intelligent, competent, and assertive, like in the books.  However, having a female protagonist who does not get together with at least one of the male leads is virtually unprecedented in Hollywood, which is what is making me nervous.",6,0

b1wlmTNERqE,"Love it! I still remember when I used to listen to Breakaway back in 4th grade. Kelly's music was one of the main reasons why I developed a passion for music. There was something about her style that just drew me in and inspired me use music a way to express myself. Now I'm working with my best friend as a music duo to create authentic music that really describes who we are. We are doing a live album project right now where we are releasing a song once a month. If you have a moment to check out our channel, we would really appreciate it! It's really insane how music can affect someone's life and I want to create music that has the same impact that Kelly had one me. Peace!",6,0

And I was reading some fb comments saying the judges pointed out mistakes and still overscored like um no, ur just being salty. The judges didn't like the long Breakdown, but that's not jordan's fault technically. He didn't choreograph this. And besides, his technique was so good, that even LEN was impressed. If LEN is impressed, that just means the haters just hate seeing someone be more successful than their favorites.",0,0

Then I heard my bae is gonna be here this season and I HAD to watch it. well i dont exactly watch the whole episodes, i just watch his performances and scores and place on the leaderboard the day after the show aires. And i also have the number that i call to vote for him, he's doing really good and im so happy for him, DWTS BETTER NOT FUCK THIS UP! and if he doesn't win, they should at least give the trophy to someone that can actually dance, (no shade to last season's winner)",0,0

In the end, I think it will be between Frankie and Lindsey.",0,1

8oyf8Ecwo-Y,No joke: I thought this was a trailer for a show about aliens.,12,1
8oyf8Ecwo-Y,"This trailer seems promising, because it seems to be following the books pretty closely. \\n\\nOne secret wish:  I hope they don't throw in some shoehorned in romance between Sarah and one of the male leads (like John or Marcus Isaacson.) In addition to being kinda pointless, a key part of Sarah's characterization in the books was that she was a woman in the 1890's (still technically the Victorian Era) who wasn't interested in men or romance; but preferred to focus on her career. At one point in the sequel, she comments how society has made her feel stigmatized as unnatural and an odd spinster lady and less than a woman due to the fact that she is pursuing her career rather than marriage and motherhood. If they show her falling in love with and/ or embarking on a sexual relationship with one of her male costars, I think that this aspect of her characterization will be very much damaged. \\n\\nI'm not denigrating men or romance as anti feminist; but Sarah's decision to eschew marriage for her career and how society's negative reaction to this makes her feel like an outsider is a key aspect of her characterization. As Kreitzler notes (about Sarah), She told me from the beginning that she wouldn't be interested in romance with me or anyone else. She is an unusual sort of woman; she doesn't need to be with a man. \\n\\nAnyway, I hope they remain as true as possible to her characterization. It looks as though they are portraying her well here-- intelligent, competent, and assertive, like in the books.  However, having a female protagonist who does not get together with at least one of the male leads is virtually unprecedented in Hollywood, which is what is making me nervous.",6,0

If I might make a suggestions, however: 1) As mentioned below, there are a couple of terms mentioned in the episode - i.e. deglazing, reducing - that a lot of people take for granted. Although a full-blown recipe might not be needed to justify it, I feel it would be good to take a minute or so to explain the basic science behind each of these terms - next week's steak episode, for instance, would be the perfect time, since pan sauces and steak go hand in hand. 2) Sauces, as mentioned in this episode, are one of the foundations of good cooking, and you've hit upon two of the five mother sauces - bechamel and tomato. If only to introduce everyone to the other three, I think another sauce episode should be considered for the future - veloute (offers an excuse to talk about thanksgiving gravy), espagnole (brown sauce for fries), hollandaise (who doesn't like a nice plate of eggs benedict)?",0,0

Now I'm working with my best friend as a music duo to create authentic music that really describes who we are. We are doing a live album project right now where we are releasing a song once a month. If you have a moment to check out our channel, we would really appreciate it!

The judges didn't like the long Breakdown, but that's not jordan's fault technically. He didn't choreograph this. And besides, his technique was so good, that even LEN was impressed.

8oyf8Ecwo-Y,No joke: I thought this was a trailer for a show about aliens.,12,1
8oyf8Ecwo-Y,"This trailer seems promising, because it seems to be following the books pretty closely. \\n\\nOne secret wish:  I hope they don't throw in some shoehorned in romance between Sarah and one of the male leads (like John or Marcus Isaacson.) In addition to being kinda pointless, a key part of Sarah's characterization in the books was that she was a woman in the 1890's (still technically the Victorian Era) who wasn't interested in men or romance; but preferred to focus on her career. At one point in the sequel, she comments how society has made her feel stigmatized as unnatural and an odd spinster lady and less than a woman due to the fact that she is pursuing her career rather than marriage and motherhood. If they show her falling in love with and/ or embarking on a sexual relationship with one of her male costars, I think that this aspect of her characterization will be very much damaged. \\n\\nI'm not denigrating men or romance as anti feminist; but Sarah's decision to eschew marriage for her career and how society's negative reaction to this makes her feel like an outsider is a key aspect of her characterization. As Kreitzler notes (about Sarah), She told me from the beginning that she wouldn't be interested in romance with me or anyone else. She is an unusual sort of woman; she doesn't need to be with a man. \\n\\nAnyway, I hope they remain as true as possible to her characterization. It looks as though they are portraying her well here-- intelligent, competent, and assertive, like in the books.  However, having a female protagonist who does not get together with at least one of the male leads is virtually unprecedented in Hollywood, which is what is making me nervous.",6,0

xTyTQgb-y-A,"If he doesn't win, im honestly gonna lose all hope for this show, I was routing for normani last season, she and heather were the best ones but they got cheated and lost(as you can tell, im still pretty salty about that). Then I heard my bae is gonna be here this season and I HAD to watch it. well i dont exactly watch the whole episodes, i just watch his performances and scores and place on the leaderboard the day after the show aires. And i also have the number that i call to vote for him, he's doing really good and im so happy for him, DWTS BETTER NOT FUCK THIS UP! and if he doesn't win, they should at least give the trophy to someone that can actually dance, (no shade to last season's winner)",0,0

xTyTQgb-y-A,What’s the song here ? Lovely to ears,0,1
xTyTQgb-y-A,"This guy is fantastic, but he's already so polished that I don't think he will capture the majority of the hearts (votes) of the DWTS audience, whose demographic is usually females 50+ years of age and who tend to prefer watching a novice rather than a ringer compete. In the end, I think it will be between Frankie and Lindsey.",0,1
