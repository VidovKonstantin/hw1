eoArC99zm1M,"that moment when you accidentally type the declaration of independence:\\n\\nThe unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America, When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.\\n\\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, --That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn, that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.\\n\\nHe has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.\\n\\nHe has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.\\n\\nHe has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.\\n\\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.\\n\\nHe has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.\\n\\nHe has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected; whereby the Legislative powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.\\n\\nHe has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.\\n\\nHe has obstructed the Administration of Justice, by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary powers.\\n\\nHe has made Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\\n\\nHe has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harrass our people, and eat out their substance.\\n\\nHe has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.\\n\\nHe has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil power.\\n\\nHe has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:\\n\\nFor Quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\\n\\nFor protecting them, by a mock Trial, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:\\n\\nFor cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:\\n\\nFor imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:\\n\\nFor depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury:\\n\\nFor transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences\\n\\nFor abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:\\n\\nFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws, and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:\\n\\nFor suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.\\n\\nHe has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.\\n\\nHe has plundered our seas, ravaged our Coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.\\n\\nHe is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.\\n\\nHe has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.\\n\\nHe has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages, whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.\\n\\nIn every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.\\n\\nNor have We been wanting in attentions to our Brittish brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which, would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.\\n\\nWe, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States; that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.",0,0

What Bannon is focusing on is that in order to beat back the establishment, including those on the right/GOP, you have to not fall for the billy bush trap, you have to move forward and keep going. That in order to fix crisis you need not get buried in these assume the worst scenarios that do nothing but serve to defend the establishment through their media outlets pretending they care about anything but securing theirselves a position of power. And they'll use your social awareness as a weapon against anyone to achieve it when they could care less as long as the govt positions are secured.",0,0

We as Americans must now change the landscape in our election system.... root out deception and destroy the cancerous core that has produced so many false prophets in our great nation.........Thank you Steve Bannon and Donald Trump for exposing what many have died trying to expose for many decades.........We will make America Great Again and the Patriots are rising to this cause ..................In God We Trust and MAGA !!!\nShow less\nREPLY,0,0

6x62O8A8qHw,"Want to know for sure that you are going to Heaven when you die?  \\n\\nJesus is the Son of the Living GOD.  The only true GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth and there can only be ONE God that actually created everything, not many... \\n\\nJesus Died, was Buried and Rose from the dead on the third day, proving He is GOD.\\n\\nJesus said in John 14:6; Jesus said to him, “I am The Way, The Truth, and The Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.”  NKJV\\n\\nActs 4:12 states; Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name [Jesus] under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.  NKJV\\n\\nJesus said in John 3:16-17; For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world (YOU) that He even gave His One and only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him as Savior shall not perish, but have eternal life.  For God did not send the Son into the world to judge and condemn the world, that is, to initiate the final judgment of the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.  AMP\\n\\nJesus said in John 3:3; I assure you and most solemnly say to you, unless a person is Born Again, reborn from above, spiritually transformed, renewed, sanctified, he cannot ever see and experience the kingdom of God.  AMP\\n\\nRomans 10:9-11 states; that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.  NKJV\\n\\nRomans 10:13 states; For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”  NKJV\\n\\n1 Corinthians 15:1-5 states; Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you—unless you believed in vain.  3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ Died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was Buried, and that He Rose Again the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.  NKJV\\n\\nAnd REPENT...\\n\\nActs 17:30 Therefore God overlooked and disregarded the former ages of ignorance; but now He commands all people everywhere to REPENT [that is, to change their old way of thinking, to regret their past sins, and to seek God’s purpose for their lives].  AMP\\n\\nJesus said in Mark 1:15 “The [appointed period of] time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; REPENT [change your inner self—your old way of thinking, regret past sins, live your life in a way that proves REPENTANCE; seek God’s purpose for your life] and believe [with a deep, abiding trust] in the good news [regarding salvation].”  AMP\\n\\n1 John 3:10 In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.  NKJV\\n\\nFrom what I have read we know how 8 of Jesus' disciples died and all 8 of those 8 chose death rather than to simply state that Jesus had not actually rose from the dead, that they were just lying, we made it all up.  Think about that!  Would you ever choose to be murdered to maintain a complete LIE?  No you would not.  You would say “ok, ok, it was a lie”.  They would not deny their Lord to keep this life because they knew they have eternal life in Jesus because they saw Him raised from the dead.\\n\\nPlease get in a quiet and alone place SOON and pray to Jesus that He show you somehow if these things above are true.  If you are sincere, He will answer you…\\n\\nAnd don’t ever forget just as there is a GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth there is also a devil, a Satan that hates God and everything God as ever made and that means he Hates YOU and wants to deceive and trick you into believing ANYTHING except Jesus and His salvation through the cross.  Though we should never fear for God is in complete control even when we have to walk through pain in this life for a season and the devil will soon be forever in his torment and punishment.\\n\\nSome great scriptures to look up and read below:\\n\\n1 Corinthians 6:9-11\\n1 Corinthians 15:1-4\\n1 John 3:7-15\\nMicah 6:8\\nActs 17:3\\nActs 18:5\\nJohn 4:25-26\\nMark 14:61-62\\nRevelation chapters 20-22\\nThe entire New Testament",0,0

Instead of telling me no face to face like a man. Instead he ran to his body guards pointing at me with disrespect. And one of the body guards came up to me and told me off very rudely. And I'm a very very very sensitive person. So right after one of body guards talked to me I started crying and they saw me and they didn't have no fucks. It was a horrible experience.,0,0

XvPWUkHjWG0,"I love you liza but please stop trivalizing mental illness. Social anxiety does not only equal to acting awkward, if that's the case then the rate of people who have social anxiety would skyrocket. I understand that a lot of people with anxiety find comfort in talking to a camera, and I think that that's completely fine! But not only do you talk to a camera with an extrovert personality, you also act like this in your public stunts. (e.g screaming and dancing in target) Someone with social anxiety would not do the things that you do in public. Social anxiety really ruins people lives, and I understand you're trying to send the message out in a joking manner, but honestly, please don't do that when you've never really experienced it yourself, especially from how you portray yourself in your videos. It would be better if you made a video about dealing with being uncomfortable/expressing yourself in public.",1,0

FZrrfGfI3uM,"Thanks for showing the inside of that $24,000 dollar apartment.  I live in Bushwick, Brooklyn, New York, and I've seen that building from the outside when walking The High Line in Chelsea, Manhattan, New York City.  I was wondering what it's like inside, and how do the tenants have any privacy.  It's fascinating to see it from the inside and the screens that slide down and up for privacy.  Gorgeous place.  Most people I know pay rents of around $1,000 - $1,200 for a room, and if they have their own apartment, pay around $1,800 for a studio or $2,100 for a 1-bedroom in not-so-popular spot of Brooklyn, like Boerum Hill, where that girl ives for $1,700 a month.  I've heard of people who work in the Financial District (FiDi, Lower Manhattan, New York City) who pay $20,000 a month to have their own apartment. These people are earning $20,000 - $30,000 a week, so they can afford that kind of place.  New York City has some crazy rent prices here.  The good thing is that once you've lived here for a year or so, and made some friends, you can find out when a room becomes available since the best places are word of mouth.  Also, there's a plethora of free events happening in NYC pretty much 24-7.   KrisKemp.com       \\nBicycleDays.com\\nFlipFloridaLand.com",0,0

Paul Getty couldn't pay the ransom, ( Although, later, he did pay a portion of the ransom money. ), because it would put any other of his family members at risk for kidnapping, or worse forms of extortion, i.e., Criminals are never satisfied, and will repeat the same stupidity, because criminals are insane.",1,0

XvPWUkHjWG0,"I see how it can be interpreted that Liza is posing or doing it for the views. But because anxiety can be so personal, it seems like she just grazed the surface of her fears and that's okay. Sure everyone feels awkward, but anxiety is (or can be) the obsessiveness and genuine fear that disrupt your day to day actions (because not all anxieties are the same.) And that is so hard to portray in a video. Mental illnesses are serious but people deal with them in different ways like humor, writing, singing, drawing, sports, etc. And unless you are a licensed psychiatrist who has met with Liza, you have no right to say anything about her mental health.",0,0

It has destroyed many schools, homes, churches, etc. There has been said that there is to be an earthquake in California that will ruin our state. Here in California we need to be prepared. It has not been stated when it is to come. But it will be here soon. Mexico has been very destroyed in the part that the earthquake hit. Look up images and you will see how destroyed it is. I saw on the news people digging up kids, teachers, and principals being dug up. Please say a prayer that we will all be safe and to take care of everyone who lives near our earths nature disasters and everyone here in California. Thank you if you have come to the end of this.

He felt that this was one of those ideas which had the better set up for all - there was a yard for exercise, still being watched as the yard surrounded the tower.

AEaKrq3SpW8,"4:14 No, it's cleverer than that.  The uppermost bits overflow _into_ the lower bits: it's called ones' complement or end-around carry.  This is because the values to be summed are not the individual octets but rather _pairs_ of octets treated as 16-bit numbers.  Thanks to this clever ones' complement hack, it doesn't matter whether your computer is a 386 that thinks of them as little-endian numbers, or an m68k that thinks they're big-endian: each octet carries into the other octet — it's a circle that has no ends to be big or little.\\nThere's also _another_ clever hack: the checksum isn't just the sum of the packet data, instead it's _minus_ the sum of the packet data.  This means that if you want to validate the checksum on an incoming packet, you just add up the _whole_ packet, including the checksum, and if it's valid you should get *zero*.  (This turns out to be a big deal for network encapsulation — where your UDP payload is another entire packet with its own IP, UDP etc. headers — because it means you can calculate the outer checksum just by looking at the outer headers, since you know the inner packet with a correct checksum adds up to zero.  This is called Local Checksum Offload, and was invented by, erm, _me_.  But I think the people who originally designed the Internet Protocol checksum are the ones who really deserve the credit, because it's their brilliant design that made it possible.)\\n\\n7:29 The main reason for using UDP instead of TCP isn't the ACKs and the bandwidth they use, it's that latency-sensitive applications generally want each individual packet delivered as soon as possible — they don't want new data to be buffered up in the OS just because it's still waiting for some old data that's supposed to come before it but maybe isn't even relevant any more.  This rationale applies to everything from video chat (I already displayed that frame with low resolution and glitches, it's too late now to tell me what it should have shown, I want the next video frame ASAP) to financial trading (give me the most recent stock price, I don't care what the price 10 microseconds ago was!).  Lag is caused not by ACKs but by waiting for retransmissions and enforcing ordering constraints that — at the application layer — may be totally irrelevant.\\n\\n9:11 Technically (and yes I'm being pedantic now), the very top of the tree are the _root name servers_, 'a.root-servers.net' through 'm.root-servers.net'.\\n\\n10:05 Oh no, not the OSI 7-layer burrito.  Real-world networking implementations don't look anything like that over-engineered heap (does anyone really understand wtf the Presentation Layer corresponds to in the Internet protocol stack?)  The standard protocol stack today combines the physical and data-link layers into Ethernet (attempts to separate them out conceptually founder on the way the data-link part of it gets waaaay too intimate with the physical part).  Similarly, some of the network layer's functions are handled by 'layer 4' protocols like TCP or UDP, and some functions that OSI puts in the transport layer are done either by IP or by other layer-3 protocols that go straight on top of Ethernet rather than being wrapped in IP datagrams.  Sometimes the layering even differs between IPv4 and IPv6: ARP, which is considered a link layer function, is layered on top of Ethernet, making it network layer; its IPv6 equivalent, Neighbour Discovery, is part of ICMPv6, sent inside IPv6 datagrams, making it technically a transport layer protocol!\\nCertainly the Internet protocol suite _is_ layered, but the trouble with the OSI model is that it's so neat and theoretically elaborated that it _sounds_ like it should be a strict and precise thing, whereas real, working networks are inevitably messy and don't follow neat layering boundaries.  See also RFC3439.  While the OSI model does give us a few nice names (Layer 3, Layer 4, and also (though it doesn't actually define it itself) Layer 8 for the user's intentions and behaviour layer), it shouldn't be taught without a warning that it's basically a cross between numerology and stamp-collecting.",33,6

5DDB6YnVCoA,"Hey Nick! I have some news for you. Today I conducted THE GREAT CUPCAKE COOKOFF! Basically comparing 4 different vanilla cupcake recipes in search of the best one. Yours was one of the contenders along with three other cooking youtubers who I won't name (all you need to know is they are VERY well recieved on YouTube). The Scran Line came out #1!!! The cupcakes puffed far up more than the others, were incredibly moist with a beautiful soft texture and of course were also a knock out on flavor. I was skeptical about the yoghurt but I couldn't taste it at all in the final product. This one is going straight to my recipe book and all my friends agree that they are delicious.

Clean-up is easy too, if you want, you can mix everything in one mixing bowl.\\n\\nThe best bananas to use for banana bread are those that are over-ripe. The yellow peels should be at least half browned, and the bananas inside squishy and browning.\\nIngredients\\n\\n    2 to 3 very ripe bananas, peeled\\n    1/3 cup melted butter\\n    1 teaspoon baking soda\\n    Pinch of salt\\n    3/4 cup sugar (1/2 cup if you would like it less sweet, 1 cup if more sweet)\\n    1 large egg, beaten\\n    1 teaspoon vanilla extract\\n    1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour\\n\\nMethod\\n\\n1 Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C), and butter a 4x8-inch loaf pan.\\n\\n2 In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth.

_iBpGz54ngs,"I love Jeremy Camp's songs and he's wonderfully talented worship pastor. I wonder if he sees Jesus as one who advocates for the marginalized in Christian society, namely the Lesbian, Transgender, Bisexual, Gay Christian community?  A part of me thinks he wouldn't understand their struggles to use his straight privilege to speak up for them... the cost would be too high and he'd lose his influence before most evangelical support. Maybe I'm wrong. Just wondering. If this matter is important for secular moral people, and not Christians, LGTBQ Christians will find support outside the church (as most do already).",3,3

AEaKrq3SpW8,Who knew so much thought went into distributing cat videos?,7,0
AEaKrq3SpW8,"4:14 No, it's cleverer than that.  The uppermost bits overflow _into_ the lower bits: it's called ones' complement or end-around carry.  This is because the values to be summed are not the individual octets but rather _pairs_ of octets treated as 16-bit numbers.  Thanks to this clever ones' complement hack, it doesn't matter whether your computer is a 386 that thinks of them as little-endian numbers, or an m68k that thinks they're big-endian: each octet carries into the other octet — it's a circle that has no ends to be big or little.\\nThere's also _another_ clever hack: the checksum isn't just the sum of the packet data, instead it's _minus_ the sum of the packet data.  This means that if you want to validate the checksum on an incoming packet, you just add up the _whole_ packet, including the checksum, and if it's valid you should get *zero*.  (This turns out to be a big deal for network encapsulation — where your UDP payload is another entire packet with its own IP, UDP etc. headers — because it means you can calculate the outer checksum just by looking at the outer headers, since you know the inner packet with a correct checksum adds up to zero.  This is called Local Checksum Offload, and was invented by, erm, _me_.  But I think the people who originally designed the Internet Protocol checksum are the ones who really deserve the credit, because it's their brilliant design that made it possible.)\\n\\n7:29 The main reason for using UDP instead of TCP isn't the ACKs and the bandwidth they use, it's that latency-sensitive applications generally want each individual packet delivered as soon as possible — they don't want new data to be buffered up in the OS just because it's still waiting for some old data that's supposed to come before it but maybe isn't even relevant any more.  This rationale applies to everything from video chat (I already displayed that frame with low resolution and glitches, it's too late now to tell me what it should have shown, I want the next video frame ASAP) to financial trading (give me the most recent stock price, I don't care what the price 10 microseconds ago was!).  Lag is caused not by ACKs but by waiting for retransmissions and enforcing ordering constraints that — at the application layer — may be totally irrelevant.\\n\\n9:11 Technically (and yes I'm being pedantic now), the very top of the tree are the _root name servers_, 'a.root-servers.net' through 'm.root-servers.net'.\\n\\n10:05 Oh no, not the OSI 7-layer burrito.  Real-world networking implementations don't look anything like that over-engineered heap (does anyone really understand wtf the Presentation Layer corresponds to in the Internet protocol stack?)  The standard protocol stack today combines the physical and data-link layers into Ethernet (attempts to separate them out conceptually founder on the way the data-link part of it gets waaaay too intimate with the physical part).  Similarly, some of the network layer's functions are handled by 'layer 4' protocols like TCP or UDP, and some functions that OSI puts in the transport layer are done either by IP or by other layer-3 protocols that go straight on top of Ethernet rather than being wrapped in IP datagrams.  Sometimes the layering even differs between IPv4 and IPv6: ARP, which is considered a link layer function, is layered on top of Ethernet, making it network layer; its IPv6 equivalent, Neighbour Discovery, is part of ICMPv6, sent inside IPv6 datagrams, making it technically a transport layer protocol!\\nCertainly the Internet protocol suite _is_ layered, but the trouble with the OSI model is that it's so neat and theoretically elaborated that it _sounds_ like it should be a strict and precise thing, whereas real, working networks are inevitably messy and don't follow neat layering boundaries.  See also RFC3439.  While the OSI model does give us a few nice names (Layer 3, Layer 4, and also (though it doesn't actually define it itself) Layer 8 for the user's intentions and behaviour layer), it shouldn't be taught without a warning that it's basically a cross between numerology and stamp-collecting.",37,7

DKY09vZWj88,"This movie made me feel angry but weirdly fascinated when I was really small, I was not able to watch the second half of the film until I start to become a teenager and I begun to understand the deep nature of what was for me just a violent and weird film.",11,0
DKY09vZWj88,This is some visionary shit,51,2
DKY09vZWj88,I have a half hour break but screenprism definitely deserves half of that.,14,1
DKY09vZWj88,I love you guys. Is this channel run by film study majors??,5,0
DKY09vZWj88,"The message is that you should let someone choose. You can’t force them to be someone they’re not. Alex may be a psycho but the government turned out to be worse than he is. It’s a brilliant move on Kubrick’s part for us to feel sorry for someone like Alex while being disgusted at the author’s actions at the end, despite what Alex did to him. It’s one of the best examples of character development.\\n\\nI love this film. It’s a prime example of cinema and the one film I can connect it to is The Master, another film about stripping choice from a person. Could you please do a video on that masterpiece as well?",8,0

DKY09vZWj88,This movie is SO disturbing.,3,0
DKY09vZWj88,Perfect timing. Saw it for the first time 2 days ago,3,0
DKY09vZWj88,4:12 Nadsat wasn't made by Alex. It's just the general slang Anthony Burgess created for all the teenagers.,5,1
DKY09vZWj88,I personally prefer the end of the movie than the book.  The book makes it seem like all Alex did was because it's a teenager being a teenager but the film embraced his psychopathic behavior.,17,2
DKY09vZWj88,"The film and book are both undeniably visionary, but I think critics still struggle to embrace Alex as an anti-hero because of how exploitative A Clockwork Orange's violence and sexual assault seem to be. I wouldn't go so far to say that Kubrick or Burgess used this kind of hyper-violence just for shock value, but even in the novel/book's morally bankrupt world, it feels disturbing and repulsive to have someone so reprehensible not only get away with many of his crimes, but also be celebrated as the glamorous anti-hero of his story. Perhaps all of that is kind of the point, but personally for me, being in Alex's head was too uncomfortable to me, and I wanted out. \\nBy the movie's end, I wouldn't go so far as ScreenPrism concludes and say that we are ultimately glad that Alex returns to his violent self, more so that we come to understand him as not being as easily villafiable in the context of the society he lives in.",0,0
DKY09vZWj88,Alex rapes two young girls and Kubrick portrays it as consensual. I'll never get past that. Book is excellent; movie is not.,0,0
DKY09vZWj88,Kinda surprised to see this channel praising a rapist character.,0,0
DKY09vZWj88,"I read the novel in 1974 when I was around 14. I found it in the local library. I didn't see the film until many, many years later. At the time of reading it, I was also reading Orwell & other scifi authors who mainly wrote social commentary via dystopian future fiction. I remember the book being pretty brutal but seeing something on screen visually is always somehow different than reading about it. And sometimes artistic choices directors make to get a visual idea across can fall flat, especially when dealing with extreme violence or sexual themes.\\n\\nAnyways, I remember that book making me think, really think, about issues like social responsibility & ethical treatment of criminals, & just question the foundation of morality & free will itself. My recommendation would be to read the novel before seeing the film. Malcolm MacDowell is absolutely chilling as Alex.",2,0

DKY09vZWj88,"Nice video, but Alex the character does not make up the language he uses per se. He utilizes the slang created and used by his generation, or whatever, but he doesn't invent his language. Not to take away from his brilliance or intelligence in the way he uses his language, which is poetic and creative too, but it seems this is a fairly important distinction to make.

Clean-up is easy too, if you want, you can mix everything in one mixing bowl.\\n\\nThe best bananas to use for banana bread are those that are over-ripe. The yellow peels should be at least half browned, and the bananas inside squishy and browning.\\nIngredients\\n\\n    2 to 3 very ripe bananas, peeled\\n    1/3 cup melted butter\\n    1 teaspoon baking soda\\n    Pinch of salt\\n    3/4 cup sugar (1/2 cup if you would like it less sweet, 1 cup if more sweet)\\n    1 large egg, beaten\\n    1 teaspoon vanilla extract\\n    1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour\\n\\nMethod\\n\\n1 Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C), and butter a 4x8-inch loaf pan.\\n\\n2 In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until completely smooth.

JvUGfF0iYtU,"-I hate the way they minimized Mike's story in the new version. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the new adaptation, but Mike was basically the historian of the group. As well as the racism plaguing Mike and his family, it should have been included. It was a vital point in the book and film and explained why Henry targeted Mike a lot more and made him more than just the token black kid for diversity points.-",1,0

JvUGfF0iYtU,"Just saw the 2017 version yesterday. They also changed some of the fears the kids had to deal with. I actually liked the idea of being afraid of water, and the movie, I Was A Teenaged Werewolf. I think the only thing they could've done better w the 2017 version is slow the progression of the movie down. That's what made the mini series great. You, as the audience were investing more time w the kids as they bonded together, but what I watched yesterday did feel a little rushed.\\nThe other thing about the 'timeline' idea was the mini series gave the backgrounds of the adults as each character was introduced. I absolutely loved the dialogue that Ben Hanscom has w his lover - I was a butterball. As kids we all have those awkward phases we go through, and like Ben, I went through that same phase in high school. I always had that pudgy extra weight that I carried around. Now, I'm not extremely fit, but I've done better than some other guys who've struggled w their weight, so I best identify w Ben Handscom. I'm not married yet, but if you saw the mini series, there's a little something about two certain people, w/o giving the ending of Chapter Two for next year.\\nOh, one more thing, I think if you've read the book or saw the mini series, this is a plus, because some horror movie fans will walk into the theater to watch this year's version and have no clue as to what they're watching,......",0,0

I also prefer Tim Curry's performance over this new guy, as well as pennywise design also the soundtrack was a lot better in the old one, the only thing i liked better in this one, was that they actually showed what each kid was afraid of, but the old one, they just showed pennywise, also the cgi was garbage in the new one.",0,0

I wonder if he sees Jesus as one who advocates for the marginalized in Christian society, namely the Lesbian, Transgender, Bisexual, Gay Christian community?  A part of me thinks he wouldn't understand their struggles to use his straight privilege to speak up for them... the cost would be too high and he'd lose his influence before most evangelical support. Maybe I'm wrong. Just wondering. If this matter is important for secular moral people, and not Christians, LGTBQ Christians will find support outside the church (as most do already).",3,3

5DDB6YnVCoA,"Hey Nick! I have some news for you. Today I conducted THE GREAT CUPCAKE COOKOFF! Basically comparing 4 different vanilla cupcake recipes in search of the best one. Yours was one of the contenders along with three other cooking youtubers who I won't name (all you need to know is they are VERY well recieved on YouTube). The Scran Line came out #1!!! The cupcakes puffed far up more than the others, were incredibly moist with a beautiful soft texture and of course were also a knock out on flavor. I was skeptical about the yoghurt but I couldn't taste it at all in the final product. This one is going straight to my recipe book and all my friends agree that they are delicious.

AEaKrq3SpW8,Who knew so much thought went into distributing cat videos?,8,0
AEaKrq3SpW8,"4:14 No, it's cleverer than that.  The uppermost bits overflow _into_ the lower bits: it's called ones' complement or end-around carry.  This is because the values to be summed are not the individual octets but rather _pairs_ of octets treated as 16-bit numbers.  Thanks to this clever ones' complement hack, it doesn't matter whether your computer is a 386 that thinks of them as little-endian numbers, or an m68k that thinks they're big-endian: each octet carries into the other octet — it's a circle that has no ends to be big or little.\\nThere's also _another_ clever hack: the checksum isn't just the sum of the packet data, instead it's _minus_ the sum of the packet data.  This means that if you want to validate the checksum on an incoming packet, you just add up the _whole_ packet, including the checksum, and if it's valid you should get *zero*.  (This turns out to be a big deal for network encapsulation — where your UDP payload is another entire packet with its own IP, UDP etc. headers — because it means you can calculate the outer checksum just by looking at the outer headers, since you know the inner packet with a correct checksum adds up to zero.  This is called Local Checksum Offload, and was invented by, erm, _me_.  But I think the people who originally designed the Internet Protocol checksum are the ones who really deserve the credit, because it's their brilliant design that made it possible.)\\n\\n7:29 The main reason for using UDP instead of TCP isn't the ACKs and the bandwidth they use, it's that latency-sensitive applications generally want each individual packet delivered as soon as possible — they don't want new data to be buffered up in the OS just because it's still waiting for some old data that's supposed to come before it but maybe isn't even relevant any more.  This rationale applies to everything from video chat (I already displayed that frame with low resolution and glitches, it's too late now to tell me what it should have shown, I want the next video frame ASAP) to financial trading (give me the most recent stock price, I don't care what the price 10 microseconds ago was!).  Lag is caused not by ACKs but by waiting for retransmissions and enforcing ordering constraints that — at the application layer — may be totally irrelevant.\\n\\n9:11 Technically (and yes I'm being pedantic now), the very top of the tree are the _root name servers_, 'a.root-servers.net' through 'm.root-servers.net'.\\n\\n10:05 Oh no, not the OSI 7-layer burrito.  Real-world networking implementations don't look anything like that over-engineered heap (does anyone really understand wtf the Presentation Layer corresponds to in the Internet protocol stack?)  The standard protocol stack today combines the physical and data-link layers into Ethernet (attempts to separate them out conceptually founder on the way the data-link part of it gets waaaay too intimate with the physical part).  Similarly, some of the network layer's functions are handled by 'layer 4' protocols like TCP or UDP, and some functions that OSI puts in the transport layer are done either by IP or by other layer-3 protocols that go straight on top of Ethernet rather than being wrapped in IP datagrams.  Sometimes the layering even differs between IPv4 and IPv6: ARP, which is considered a link layer function, is layered on top of Ethernet, making it network layer; its IPv6 equivalent, Neighbour Discovery, is part of ICMPv6, sent inside IPv6 datagrams, making it technically a transport layer protocol!\\nCertainly the Internet protocol suite _is_ layered, but the trouble with the OSI model is that it's so neat and theoretically elaborated that it _sounds_ like it should be a strict and precise thing, whereas real, working networks are inevitably messy and don't follow neat layering boundaries.  See also RFC3439.  While the OSI model does give us a few nice names (Layer 3, Layer 4, and also (though it doesn't actually define it itself) Layer 8 for the user's intentions and behaviour layer), it shouldn't be taught without a warning that it's basically a cross between numerology and stamp-collecting.",38,7

_iBpGz54ngs,"I love Jeremy Camp's songs and he's wonderfully talented worship pastor. I wonder if he sees Jesus as one who advocates for the marginalized in Christian society, namely the Lesbian, Transgender, Bisexual, Gay Christian community?  A part of me thinks he wouldn't understand their struggles to use his straight privilege to speak up for them... the cost would be too high and he'd lose his influence before most evangelical support. Maybe I'm wrong. Just wondering. If this matter is important for secular moral people, and not Christians, LGTBQ Christians will find support outside the church (as most do already).",4,3

JvUGfF0iYtU,"Just saw the 2017 version yesterday. They also changed some of the fears the kids had to deal with. I actually liked the idea of being afraid of water, and the movie, I Was A Teenaged Werewolf. I think the only thing they could've done better w the 2017 version is slow the progression of the movie down. That's what made the mini series great. You, as the audience were investing more time w the kids as they bonded together, but what I watched yesterday did feel a little rushed.\\nThe other thing about the 'timeline' idea was the mini series gave the backgrounds of the adults as each character was introduced. I absolutely loved the dialogue that Ben Hanscom has w his lover - I was a butterball. As kids we all have those awkward phases we go through, and like Ben, I went through that same phase in high school. I always had that pudgy extra weight that I carried around. Now, I'm not extremely fit, but I've done better than some other guys who've struggled w their weight, so I best identify w Ben Handscom. I'm not married yet, but if you saw the mini series, there's a little something about two certain people, w/o giving the ending of Chapter Two for next year.\\nOh, one more thing, I think if you've read the book or saw the mini series, this is a plus, because some horror movie fans will walk into the theater to watch this year's version and have no clue as to what they're watching,......",0,0

JvUGfF0iYtU,"i enjoyed both old and new, but I still prefer the old one, I don't think the child actors are that good in the new one, all the child actors in the old one were just perfect, and the new one over exaggerated the profanity, what are these kids like in 7th grade, it just sounds ridiculous hearing them curse every other sentence. I also prefer Tim Curry's performance over this new guy, as well as pennywise design also the soundtrack was a lot better in the old one, the only thing i liked better in this one, was that they actually showed what each kid was afraid of, but the old one, they just showed pennywise, also the cgi was garbage in the new one.",0,0

Yours was one of the contenders along with three other cooking youtubers who I won't name (all you need to know is they are VERY well recieved on YouTube). The Scran Line came out #1!!! The cupcakes puffed far up more than the others, were incredibly moist with a beautiful soft texture and of course were also a knock out on flavor. I was skeptical about the yoghurt but I couldn't taste it at all in the final product. This one is going straight to my recipe book and all my friends agree that they are delicious.

I think the only thing they could've done better w the 2017 version is slow the progression of the movie down. That's what made the mini series great. You, as the audience were investing more time w the kids as they bonded together, but what I watched yesterday did feel a little rushed.\\nThe other thing about the 'timeline' idea was the mini series gave the backgrounds of the adults as each character was introduced. I absolutely loved the dialogue that Ben Hanscom has w his lover - I was a butterball. As kids we all have those awkward phases we go through, and like Ben, I went through that same phase in high school. I always had that pudgy extra weight that I carried around. Now, I'm not extremely fit, but I've done better than some other guys who've struggled w their weight, so I best identify w Ben Handscom. I'm not married yet, but if you saw the mini series, there's a little something about two certain people, w/o giving the ending of Chapter Two for next year.\\nOh, one more thing, I think if you've read the book or saw the mini series, this is a plus, because some horror movie fans will walk into the theater to watch this year's version and have no clue as to what they're watching,......",0,0
JvUGfF0iYtU,"i enjoyed both old and new, but I still prefer the old one, I don't think the child actors are that good in the new one, all the child actors in the old one were just perfect, and the new one over exaggerated the profanity, what are these kids like in 7th grade, it just sounds ridiculous hearing them curse every other sentence. I also prefer Tim Curry's performance over this new guy, as well as pennywise design also the soundtrack was a lot better in the old one, the only thing i liked better in this one, was that they actually showed what each kid was afraid of, but the old one, they just showed pennywise, also the cgi was garbage in the new one.",0,0

As well as the racism plaguing Mike and his family, it should have been included. It was a vital point in the book and film and explained why Henry targeted Mike a lot more and made him more than just the token black kid for diversity points.-",1,0

JvUGfF0iYtU,The linear story works best for the remake because a lot of people I know who went to see the 2017 version didn't read the book or see the miniseries so with linear storytelling when characters are in trouble the stakes are actually high as opposed to flashbacks where you know they make it out okay,0,1
JvUGfF0iYtU,"The problems i had with the movie  are the overuse of cgi that will obviously look outdated within 2 years, and the two chatacters mike and whatever his name is that basically have no screen time or lines in the movie. It wasnt scary, it was eerie and funny......",0,1
JvUGfF0iYtU,"I'll tell you what this movie REALLY did differently: Cliche and unscary/unnecessary jump scares, sudden loud music, and lame ass children laughing sound effects (how fucking lame). It copied everything from every current generation horror movie and shoved it in there. Not only did this ruin the scares, but it ruined the feel of the movie and it also made itself at home into the giant pile of garbage filled with the other crappy over done horror films. This movie was made for high school children who think it's fun to sneak into a rated R movie, which, (spoilers) the only reason it's rated R is because of the F word. It's not even violent or gory! The only thing that saved the film, (if you can even say that) was the acting was actually surprisingly decent. What a disappointing, piece of shit film, and a waste of time.",1,0

Yours was one of the contenders along with three other cooking youtubers who I won't name (all you need to know is they are VERY well recieved on YouTube). The Scran Line came out #1!!! The cupcakes puffed far up more than the others, were incredibly moist with a beautiful soft texture and of course were also a knock out on flavor. I was skeptical about the yoghurt but I couldn't taste it at all in the final product. This one is going straight to my recipe book and all my friends agree that they are delicious.

8QKP7LXWlHk,"Thank you for making a video highlighting vegan food! I just went vegan this past May. I am hoping to improve my over all health with a whole food vegan diet. So far my health isn't any worse! Yay! My dysmenorrhea seems to be gone, but I don't want to say for sure until a full year of it being gone. I'm looking forward to seeing what this diet does to my blood panels. I haven't noticed a change for my HEDS nor my Dysautonomia, but I'll take what I can get. XD I know the people of Okinawa ate a nearly vegan diet long long ago. They used to eat many starches. They used to have some of the greatest number of centurions on the planet. I'd love to see a video learning more about the older traditional Okinawan lifestyle. They have lots to offer besides a high starch diet. Plus I hear it's absolutely beautiful there. Maybe you've already filmed there, but maybe this is a new excuse to visit. ;) I'd be really interested to learn about more traditionally vegan dishes of Japan. (Like the stuff that people don't think of as vegan.) A guide to what widely available Vegan dishes might be safe to eat in Japan would be pretty neat too! Okay, enough rambling from me.

There is NO premium, as this type of classification is truly different for each individual.\\nAs we aknowledge beauty and good taste differently, the same way we take premium under consideration.

9EBgaxFfDA0,Apple buys Artificial Sapphire for some company I forgot the name of. Search it on YT there's. Short documentary on it. And I hurt me more of see u scratch Tissot watch than Apple watch,0,0
9EBgaxFfDA0,I think they use sapphire coated glass because a pure sapphire crystal would be quite brittle. Even with just the sapphire coating the expensive Apple watches are easier to shatter at least compared to an unscratched base model with a glass screen. As the glass gets scratched easily it gets weaker agains impacts and might shatter as well.\n\nUsing a pure crystal is a lot easier in a traditional watch as it is round eg. has no sharp edges or corners. The weak edge is protected by the metal housing of the watch. The Apple Watch’s design leaves a pure crystal very vulnerable and it would probably completely shatter in normal use.,0,0

9EBgaxFfDA0,I am pretty sure they use impure Sapphire because it is super difficult to make in that shape and maybe the impurities help? Also it might make a difference for a touch screen but idk. Not an excuse though. For close to 1500$ you could get a much more reliable watch. Possibly even a after market Rolex if you are lucky. I rock a g-shock mudmaster 24/7 and I love it. It has Sapphire as well and was only 700,0,0

Just to make it sounds expensive and can charge more? \\nBy doing this Apple you just showing me how you want to do business like, just fooling customers around and cutting the edges to everything to make more profit, no longer like before, which you just want to make the best product!\\nMaybe this is why from a company leading 5 years to now just like other company and some other company even ahead of you!",0,0

Plain and simple. Janet Reno should be in prison for her handling of this case, but of course the Deep State protects their own. None of the criminals in our government will be arrested, instead they will live out their days in wealth.\\n\\nAmerican patriots understand that the opposite of freedom is oppression.

Pancakes aren't just dripped into a pan; you need to swirl the pan around so the batter spreads and you need to turn it over. Waffles get fried on both ends simultaneously. The toppings for both are mostly the same, but you can roll up a pancake and cut it, while a waffle and its toppings cannot be stuck together like you would a pancake. For pancakes you would also rather choose toppings that can be spread out such as (granulated) sugar, jam, or nutella.",1,2

PHpMh4E4KKQ,"Nice to see her progress in one video; she made an amazing comeback after being born so premature...only 29 pounds; I've seen cats that weighed only slightly less than that. :-) It would be nice too to see how they introduced her to her mom and dad, who have now totally accepted her presence and are very sweet and gentle with her, although they may not exactly realize she is their baby. That's really the best part of her story because it means she can grow up as naturally as possible for a zoo hippo, close to her mom and dad and learning from them; hippos aren't exactly monogamous animals and fathers usually don't do much childcare, but they are social and it's normal for them to live in groups. I like the new movement to help zoo animals grow up to be the animals nature intended them to be, rather than pets. Adult hippos are actually very dangerous and no responsible zoo would ever let a keeper swim with one, so it's good they're gradually weaning Fiona away from human contact.",2,1

8QKP7LXWlHk,"Thank you for making a video highlighting vegan food! I just went vegan this past May. I am hoping to improve my over all health with a whole food vegan diet. So far my health isn't any worse! Yay! My dysmenorrhea seems to be gone, but I don't want to say for sure until a full year of it being gone. I'm looking forward to seeing what this diet does to my blood panels. I haven't noticed a change for my HEDS nor my Dysautonomia, but I'll take what I can get. XD I know the people of Okinawa ate a nearly vegan diet long long ago. They used to eat many starches. They used to have some of the greatest number of centurions on the planet. I'd love to see a video learning more about the older traditional Okinawan lifestyle. They have lots to offer besides a high starch diet. Plus I hear it's absolutely beautiful there. Maybe you've already filmed there, but maybe this is a new excuse to visit. ;) I'd be really interested to learn about more traditionally vegan dishes of Japan. (Like the stuff that people don't think of as vegan.) A guide to what widely available Vegan dishes might be safe to eat in Japan would be pretty neat too! Okay, enough rambling from me. Have a wonderful day and best wishes! 🌟⭐🌟",0,0

9EBgaxFfDA0,Apple buys Artificial Sapphire for some company I forgot the name of. Search it on YT there's. Short documentary on it. And I hurt me more of see u scratch Tissot watch than Apple watch,0,0
9EBgaxFfDA0,I think they use sapphire coated glass because a pure sapphire crystal would be quite brittle. Even with just the sapphire coating the expensive Apple watches are easier to shatter at least compared to an unscratched base model with a glass screen. As the glass gets scratched easily it gets weaker agains impacts and might shatter as well.\n\nUsing a pure crystal is a lot easier in a traditional watch as it is round eg. has no sharp edges or corners. The weak edge is protected by the metal housing of the watch. The Apple Watch’s design leaves a pure crystal very vulnerable and it would probably completely shatter in normal use.,0,0

6JV_q-vrfBw,"I agree 100% with the right for free speech. However, there is a wrong way and a right way of doing things if you want to get a positive message across. America is a very patriotic country and if you want to kneel during the anthem, then you can expect you're going to piss off half the country. Is that the best method to get people behind you for a cause? I think we all know the answer is no. \\nPeople insist that Trump is dividing the US, but it's been happening long before he got there.\\nI admire that people have a message they want to send but look at how they are doing it.\\nProtest is great but if you can't do it without pissing people off then you will never convince people to stand with you. You are actually part of what is dividing the country.\\nStop BLM, stop kneeling during the anthem, stop blaming the police when you feel someone is killed for being black.\\nBLM alienates people who aren't black, kneeling during the anthem is a sign of disrespect to the country.\\nDo you honestly think police are out looking for black people to shoot? If you believe that you are stupid and will never find a solution. You're not asking the right questions. Why are the police so scared or nervous when they approach a black man/woman? That's the question you need to find an answer to. I think if you start looking more at systematic oppression rather than racism you might start getting somewhere. Lets face it a cop of any ethnicity that isn't black is going to be on edge going into a black neighbourhood. Why? Why are they more sensitive to danger in these areas? The numbers are all there for anyone who cares to look them up. It is more dangerous for police to patrol these areas. Plain and simple. The police are actual victims of this systematic oppression as well. \\nStart doing things right where you can expect a positive outcome and I promise you will have more people stand behind the cause, whatever that may be.",0,0
6JV_q-vrfBw,"So this whole taking a knee this is being painted as a protest against police aggression etc. Ok... fine... but consider this: Kaepernick took a. Knee a long time ago. It wasn’t until Trump said something that all these other players took a knee. So what is really being protested here? The President or police aggression? Was police aggression not a major issue in the first place? So why wait so long to protest if the issue was truly that critical? Now some are saying it’s a free speech issue... ok... Where are all the troops arresting people for free speech? The NFL refused to run a Daniel Defense ad during the Super Bowl and the ad was not even controversial in its nature. Were there people crying fowl and disrespecting the Nation then when the NFL made that decision? So the last resort is to make it a race issue... ok... so I must surely be racist then because I respect my country and my President even when I disagree with him at times just like I did with Obama.\\n\\nThe bottom line is this messaging of these protests is confusing because it doesn’t even carry a single message, because certain people are refusing to state the truth about themselves which is no matter what Trump says or does whether right or wrong they are going to treat people who voted for him  like they are the worst people on earth no matter what. The National anthem and the many things claiming to be protested including the President are not connected in any way which is further confusing things and just making people mad at this point.\\n\\nI’m left with one option... I’m going to take a knee during every single game for the entire game until this nonsense stops. I will not go to any NFL games. I will not watch any NFL games. I will not buy NFL merchandise. I will not even check the scores. That is how I’m protesting and my message is clear. I will not support an organization that took a perfectly good sport and allowed itself to become some strange political tool that disrespects my country.",0,0

cpvUG_fo6lU,"If Melo can play to his strengths I agree with Stephen A. If Melo plays like he always has I agree with Max. Melo has to get to that damn corner where his efficiency goes way up. He should get open looks with George and Westbrook driving, and Adams crashing the glass. Melo needs to become a spot up shooter and drive when it's there. If I was coaching Melo I would say, no holding onto the ball unless its 5 seconds or less on the shot clock. Only then should you be creating your own shot, this goes for George too. Westbrook can dominate the ball and utilize the weapons around him, which are much better then last year.\\n\\nI don't see this happening though lol. Melo and George have to adapt to a completely new role, which I don't see going well. OKC finishes 4th. Wins first round, and loses second round.",0,0

Plain and simple. Janet Reno should be in prison for her handling of this case, but of course the Deep State protects their own. None of the criminals in our government will be arrested, instead they will live out their days in wealth.\\n\\nAmerican patriots understand that the opposite of freedom is oppression.

Grow up LeBron you are not as smart as you think you are, and especially as smart as your fans think you are. LeBron James seems to be a man of very average I intellect with a likely IQ below 100.

He never stepped into a college classroom: no course in the basics of sociology, history, poly sci, government, English,  like most college grads and he does not come off like he does a lot of self study, he sounds dumb regurgitating statements of the Left.

PHpMh4E4KKQ,"Nice to see her progress in one video; she made an amazing comeback after being born so premature...only 29 pounds; I've seen cats that weighed only slightly less than that. :-) It would be nice too to see how they introduced her to her mom and dad, who have now totally accepted her presence and are very sweet and gentle with her, although they may not exactly realize she is their baby. That's really the best part of her story because it means she can grow up as naturally as possible for a zoo hippo, close to her mom and dad and learning from them; hippos aren't exactly monogamous animals and fathers usually don't do much childcare, but they are social and it's normal for them to live in groups. I like the new movement to help zoo animals grow up to be the animals nature intended them to be, rather than pets. Adult hippos are actually very dangerous and no responsible zoo would ever let a keeper swim with one, so it's good they're gradually weaning Fiona away from human contact.",2,1
PHpMh4E4KKQ,What's the ratio of Male:Females involved with the hippo? Seems like a female dominated workplace. Time to fire half the staff and make it 50:50 right? Females don't have any issue with this because it's all about equality.,0,0

I understand you don't like pitty party's I do not either they make it hard to get out of the black hole of sadness that is every day. .. So seriously you can't die not yet not by your own cute adorable hands because everyone like us who has pain. We were born for a reason that reason is to feel all life has to give us in return for the suffering.  Even if it's not a good day there will be one and seeing you strive on inspires me not to hit the K.O button on this game of life... So please push on and hope to meet you one day.  Even if I have to fly all the way to Japan to just get to meet you I will. :') I love you Mar-Mar please don't stop being Kawaii and living. And *hugs and baths* for all the bad days!.....(seriously I mean it... You inspire me)...

I don't think IT will play much because of his hip, Rose nor Calderon will be a factor, there gonna need Wade big time.  I agree with Max here because Wade's addition will definitely put Cleveland in the finals and in my opinion give them a better chance at winning the finals also.  Whereas without him and no more moves by Cleveland I think Boston would have made it.  OKC would have made it further than the first round with the addition  of Paul George alone.  Now with Carmelo they might make it to the Western Conference Finals but they still will not get by the Warriors.  So basically Wade = Ring, Melo = 0.",0,0

He actually had some big Alley oop passes back when LeBron played for the Heat. If that type of play comes to the Cavs, it will be a huge influence on the whole team. On the other hand idk if OKC is capable as of now, based on chemistry. They also don't have much of a solid bench. That brings me to the Cavs who are better overall based on the chemistry Dwayne Wade will bring. If I.T. heals back to original state he can contribute tremendously and he will have much defensive help; on or off the bench.",1,0
cpvUG_fo6lU,OKC were still going to 2nd round with pG13 .. Maybe even WCF but Melo does not make the much of a difference .. He just adds a bit more offence to a team that's it ...

He should get open looks with George and Westbrook driving, and Adams crashing the glass. Melo needs to become a spot up shooter and drive when it's there. If I was coaching Melo I would say, no holding onto the ball unless its 5 seconds or less on the shot clock. Only then should you be creating your own shot, this goes for George too. Westbrook can dominate the ball and utilize the weapons around him, which are much better then last year.\\n\\nI don't see this happening though lol.

And just a few months ago was balling in the playoffs with a shit bulls team. Melo is a proven scorer. But I'm still not sold on him as a big time playoffs player. Let's not forget when he left the nuggets for gallinari_ the nuggets finished 3rd that year. He goes to knicks and just fades away. All while supposedly in his peak.\n\nWade will beast till he retires. Might play a few less games here and there. But thats it.,0,1

2VXWgIOPgmw,"Here is the most accurate representation of this tragedy. \\n\\nGovernment shills will tell you that the Branch Davidians were religious nuts and allegedly pedophiles, effectively claiming that they deserved to die. \\n\\nThe TRUTH is, here in America you are innocent until proven guilty. \\nThe ATF past conduct proves that they botched many invasions and killed many innocents without a trial. \\nThis is an example of the federal government fucking up and covering it up. Plain and simple. Janet Reno should be in prison for her handling of this case, but of course the Deep State protects their own. None of the criminals in our government will be arrested, instead they will live out their days in wealth.\\n\\nAmerican patriots understand that the opposite of freedom is oppression. What is the greatest source of death and oppression in the past hundred years? Unrestrained, unquestioned government power.

No amount of spin and lies can change the fact that what the US Government did to its own citizens in Waco was abominable and absolutely illegal. Koresh was accused of sexually assaulting children, but he was entitled to a fair trial to determine his guilt or innocence. The ATF and FBI unlawfully declared him guilty and passed a death sentence on both him and his followers (including his supposed victims). For those who believe the government came to protect the children and women who were supposedly being abused, how does burning them alive help?

cpvUG_fo6lU,"I don't understand Max's thoughts here. Just look at how the players were acquired. Wade was gotten for absolutely nothing. Carmelo still got the Knicks back assets. It's clear that despite Wade having a better career than Melo so far, Melo is worth more than Wade now. Melo is more than 2 years younger, better perimeter shooter, and Melo is an above average starting PF while Wade is a below average starter at this point.",0,0

cpvUG_fo6lU,"Wade is coming to a situation in Cleveland where on paper he shouldn't be needed as much with the roster they have, but let's face it he will be.  He will probably play a lot, if for any reason because of the Lebron / Wade chemistry.  I don't think IT will play much because of his hip, Rose nor Calderon will be a factor, there gonna need Wade big time.  I agree with Max here because Wade's addition will definitely put Cleveland in the finals and in my opinion give them a better chance at winning the finals also.  Whereas without him and no more moves by Cleveland I think Boston would have made it.  OKC would have made it further than the first round with the addition  of Paul George alone.  Now with Carmelo they might make it to the Western Conference Finals but they still will not get by the Warriors.  So basically Wade = Ring, Melo = 0.",0,0

Kawhi is a one-man megastar with an excellent back-up team, CP3 and Harden both have excellent court vision and efficiency, The T-Wolves trio have a better bench, and the Warriors are too solid a team to just be beaten by 3 stars with no back-up.

He actually had some big Alley oop passes back when LeBron played for the Heat. If that type of play comes to the Cavs, it will be a huge influence on the whole team. On the other hand idk if OKC is capable as of now, based on chemistry. They also don't have much of a solid bench. That brings me to the Cavs who are better overall based on the chemistry Dwayne Wade will bring. If I.T. heals back to original state he can contribute tremendously and he will have much defensive help; on or off the bench.",1,0

cpvUG_fo6lU,"Wade isn't as good as Melo anymore, plus OKC needed another superstar so they could add Patterson to the bench to make it superb. Wade is a huge pickup for Cleveland mainly because of him being 5x better than Smith and Shumpert combined, but he can't shoot and might be only an average defender now (when he tries). But the good thing is now the Cavs can use Shumpert in a trade probably including Love and the Nets pick for another superstar or 2 all stars.",0,0

cpvUG_fo6lU,"If Melo can play to his strengths I agree with Stephen A. If Melo plays like he always has I agree with Max. Melo has to get to that damn corner where his efficiency goes way up. He should get open looks with George and Westbrook driving, and Adams crashing the glass. Melo needs to become a spot up shooter and drive when it's there. If I was coaching Melo I would say, no holding onto the ball unless its 5 seconds or less on the shot clock. Only then should you be creating your own shot, this goes for George too. Westbrook can dominate the ball and utilize the weapons around him, which are much better then last year.\\n\\nI don't see this happening though lol. Melo and George have to adapt to a completely new role, which I don't see going well. OKC finishes 4th. Wins first round, and loses second round.",0,0

Let's not forget when he left the nuggets for gallinari_ the nuggets finished 3rd that year. He goes to knicks and just fades away. All while supposedly in his peak.\n\nWade will beast till he retires. Might play a few less games here and there. But thats it.,0,1

Melo is more than 2 years younger, better perimeter shooter, and Melo is an above average starting PF while Wade is a below average starter at this point.",0,0
cpvUG_fo6lU,"Wade is coming to a situation in Cleveland where on paper he shouldn't be needed as much with the roster they have, but let's face it he will be.  He will probably play a lot, if for any reason because of the Lebron / Wade chemistry.  I don't think IT will play much because of his hip, Rose nor Calderon will be a factor, there gonna need Wade big time.  I agree with Max here because Wade's addition will definitely put Cleveland in the finals and in my opinion give them a better chance at winning the finals also.  Whereas without him and no more moves by Cleveland I think Boston would have made it.  OKC would have made it further than the first round with the addition  of Paul George alone.  Now with Carmelo they might make it to the Western Conference Finals but they still will not get by the Warriors.  So basically Wade = Ring, Melo = 0.",0,0

cpvUG_fo6lU,"If Melo can play to his strengths I agree with Stephen A. If Melo plays like he always has I agree with Max. Melo has to get to that damn corner where his efficiency goes way up. He should get open looks with George and Westbrook driving, and Adams crashing the glass. Melo needs to become a spot up shooter and drive when it's there. If I was coaching Melo I would say, no holding onto the ball unless its 5 seconds or less on the shot clock. Only then should you be creating your own shot, this goes for George too. Westbrook can dominate the ball and utilize the weapons around him, which are much better then last year.\\n\\nI don't see this happening though lol. Melo and George have to adapt to a completely new role, which I don't see going well. OKC finishes 4th. Wins first round, and loses second round.",0,0

cpvUG_fo6lU,"I agree with Max Kellerman. Truthfully because of Dwayne Wade. The Cavaliers are a completely better team. Dwayne can bring the ball up as a point guard and pass accordingly. He actually had some big Alley oop passes back when LeBron played for the Heat. If that type of play comes to the Cavs, it will be a huge influence on the whole team. On the other hand idk if OKC is capable as of now, based on chemistry. They also don't have much of a solid bench. That brings me to the Cavs who are better overall based on the chemistry Dwayne Wade will bring. If I.T. heals back to original state he can contribute tremendously and he will have much defensive help; on or off the bench.",1,0

cpvUG_fo6lU,"Wade is coming to a situation in Cleveland where on paper he shouldn't be needed as much with the roster they have, but let's face it he will be.  He will probably play a lot, if for any reason because of the Lebron / Wade chemistry.  I don't think IT will play much because of his hip, Rose nor Calderon will be a factor, there gonna need Wade big time.  I agree with Max here because Wade's addition will definitely put Cleveland in the finals and in my opinion give them a better chance at winning the finals also.  Whereas without him and no more moves by Cleveland I think Boston would have made it.  OKC would have made it further than the first round with the addition  of Paul George alone.  Now with Carmelo they might make it to the Western Conference Finals but they still will not get by the Warriors.  So basically Wade = Ring, Melo = 0.",0,0

He should get open looks with George and Westbrook driving, and Adams crashing the glass. Melo needs to become a spot up shooter and drive when it's there. If I was coaching Melo I would say, no holding onto the ball unless its 5 seconds or less on the shot clock. Only then should you be creating your own shot, this goes for George too. Westbrook can dominate the ball and utilize the weapons around him, which are much better then last year.\\n\\nI don't see this happening though lol.

He actually had some big Alley oop passes back when LeBron played for the Heat. If that type of play comes to the Cavs, it will be a huge influence on the whole team. On the other hand idk if OKC is capable as of now, based on chemistry. They also don't have much of a solid bench. That brings me to the Cavs who are better overall based on the chemistry Dwayne Wade will bring. If I.T. heals back to original state he can contribute tremendously and he will have much defensive help; on or off the bench.",1,0

cpvUG_fo6lU,"OKC will get to the conference finals MAYBE. They have two very good scorers and melo is great but not as good compared, anyways, but the rockets i feel have a way better team overall. OKC has a terrible roster other than the big three, don’t even lie ! they’re trash, they should make moves for more depth. But the spurs and rockets are probably still better than OKC IMO",1,0

And just a few months ago was balling in the playoffs with a shit bulls team. Melo is a proven scorer. But I'm still not sold on him as a big time playoffs player. Let's not forget when he left the nuggets for gallinari_ the nuggets finished 3rd that year. He goes to knicks and just fades away. All while supposedly in his peak.\n\nWade will beast till he retires. Might play a few less games here and there. But thats it.,0,1

Criminals will break down doors or break windows. People still commit murder in countries with strict gun laws. France with almost total gun bans, has had mass shootings and bombings.

byA77xkQBEE,"Australia had a mass shooting in 1996 (Port Arthur) where 35 people died and 23 were wounded. The then prime minister decided to crack down on gun laws. A lot of people in Western Australia disagreed heavily and were very mad, but he passed the law and since then Australia hasn't had a mass shooting. So I'd say we seem to be doing pretty well...nobody is paranoid about getting guns taken away because barely anyone has them. I see people saying you're going to be leaving people defenceless but who are you protecting yourselves from....each other? Taking away guns is obviously really hard to process for most people in America, so I think a good start would be to at least limit the type and amount of weapons you have. Because you don't need 13 guns for protection, because serious wtf are you protecting yourselves from with that many guns. Not only that but I've been reading up on all the loop holes there are in background checks for buying guns, where if you buy them from certain places (I've heard certain gun shows are one of them), you wont get a background check done....fucking crazy. Maybe its me as I'm a 17 year old that lives in Australia and the worst thing that comes to mind when I think of guns was the Sydney Siege...but I'll never understand the need for guns. Even if it was for protection I don't think I could make the conscious decision to risk ending someone's life like that. I'm so fucking thankful that I haven't been through a school shooting, and that its not just becoming the normal thing to happen in my country. I'm sorry if I'm being rude as I know American are very prideful people.....but get your shit together and stop letting people die.",0,0

Various legal systems and government agencies use different definitions . But in my opinion killing more than 58 people is a clear act of terrorism. Done with religious motives or not, it really doesn't matter after all, It has the same effect on the ground, people are terrorized and scared.

A vast majority of gun control legislation being bandied about in the courts (such as aesthetic restrictions on assault weapons) would have had absolutely no relevance on the actual event instead of using programs like Project Exile (look it up) that have proven to work (During the first year of Project Exile (1998), homicides in Richmond declined 33%, for the lowest number since 1987, and armed robberies declined 30%. In 1999, homicides declined another 21%).\\n\\nThere are solutions to the gun crime problem being presented on both sides, but one side is trying to use these events as leverage to force citizens to make rash decisions that move towards the solution their side prefers, (eg Hillary Clinton posting We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA”, which is essentially saying “don’t take sides, just side with me”) instead of using logic and evidence to determine which solutions are better.\\n\\nThey want people to make rash judgements, even though making important policy decisions quickly and emotionally is how we as citizens loose our civil rights. It's how the Patriot act was passed after 9/11, violating our 4th, 5th, 6th, and 8th Amendment rights and giving us the whole NSA surveillance crap, Guantanamo and waterboarding, et cetera, it's how we got involved in Afghanistan and, by extension, Iraq and Syria, and it's",0,0

If you can disprove the assumptions I am basing my questions on, feel free to point them out to me and rule out my hypothesis. Ready? Okay, here we go....\\n\\nWith the shooter fitting none of the usual profile patterns; Stephen Paddock's friends & family being completely shocked to learn he did this and mystified to learn he even owned so many guns; and we still have no possible motive in sight, I have to ask:\\n\\nAre authorities 100% sure Stephen Paddock is actually the shooter— or was he just the dead body they found lying in the room that the shots were coming from with a gun in his hand?\\n\\nIn other words, I want to know if it's perhaps possible that this guy could also be a murder victim himself and is potentially a patsy left behind to frame for the shooting? I realize this is going off the rails and into bizarre, crackpot conspiracy theory territory, but I have to wonder if it's possible with so little of this story fitting together. Nothing about this shooter adds up or fits any type of profile whatsoever. Nothing. Friends, family, neighbors, and hotel staff all say there was absolutely nothing about this man to suggest him being capable of this. He has virtually no cyber footprint, no cause he was overly passionate about, and no strong religious or political leanings one way or the other.\\n\\nI thought it very odd that in the crime scene photos that were leaked today, we see him lying dead in the room with the guns left scrawled all around him.... with gloves on his hands. Now why would anyone who barricaded himself into a room with no way out, who is planning to kill himself anyway when SWAT bursts through the door, go through the trouble of wearing gloves? Gloves are used to hide fingerprints; to hide your identity. How is this consistent with someone planning to commit suicide afterwards because there's no escape, or no hiding your involvement?\\n\\nAnd the cameras.... Those tiny cameras he planted in the door lock and room service cart— how would anyone with no military background or tactical training be capable of any of this stuff? It doesn't make sense. In fact, it flies in the face of it!\\n\\nAll of this suggests that maybe, just maybe, someone in espionage could have pulled this off. But who could, and more importantly, who would do this? There's really only one state that comes to mind of being capable of this because they have a global track record of pulling off insanely mad gambits like this: North Korea. \\n\\nAgain, I am not a nutcase or tinfoil hat conspiracy theorist.

It’s going to make them helpless in the face of someone who got their guns illegally. \\n\\nHorribly perpetrated myths like Obama’s “gun show loophole” myth are pushin people towards banning guns when they know nothing about them. I have the right to self preservation and I have the right to protect my family from the same evil that caused his tragedy. If someone illegally enters my home uninvited I have the right to splatter his brains on the wall to protect my family. I have no idea if he has a gun he obtained illegally. That’s why it’s called the “Great Equalizer”, because now I can defend myself absolutely. \\n\\nEvil people will always find a way to commit these atrocities. The will get guns illegally so the only question is do you want people to be allowed to legally defend themselves and save the lives of others. Maybe we should be backing out police officers who protect us from this, rather than backing BLM extremists who promote hating our officers. \\n\\nAll my love and prayers go to Vegas, but my family is most important to me and I have the absolute god given right to exist and to preserve my life and the lives of my family.

c3JbJmXInOs,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂\\n\\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎",1,0

3N5WORQxQUo,"Jenn, I love your content but I'm a translator and I feel really uncomfortable about this free-service thing. I am aware most youtubers are not in a position to pay to get their videos translated into every language, but big youtubers can surely choose one language based on their audience, then get a professional to do the job.\\n\\nNot only does that guarantee the quality of the service (which will in turn contribute to further growing views), but it is the ethical way to go. Mundane as it may seem to many, audiovisual translation is an actual job that should not go underpaid, let alone unpaid. And while many claim being bilingual is all it takes to do it, it takes a pro to do it well. There is only so many characters the human eye can read per second, and if you translate from English to say, Spanish, which requires some 25% additional words to express ideas, then you need somebody with optimal summarizing skills who can also keep the content short without losing the essence of the original message.\\n\\nThis is not like asking someone to hit the like button or share a video, this is asking someone to work for free. On behalf of the translators and interpreters' community, please do reconsider your request. Thank you.",0,0

byA77xkQBEE,"So here's some evidence of the effectiveness of gun control laws, summarizing this article from a neutral source: \\n\\nhttp://www.factcheck.org/2017/10/gun-control-australia-updated/\\n\\n-Australia suffered a gun massacre in 1996: 35 dead, 18 injured.\\n-The National Firearms Agreement was passed as a result. Some semi-automatic rifles and shotguns were banned and stricter registration/licensing policies were implemented. There was also a huge amount of buybacks, and 700,000 guns were sold to the government. Laws were further tightened in 2002.\\n-There were 23% fewer homicides in 2013 than there were in 1996, though some fluctuation in between.\\n-13 gun massacres happened in the 18 years before the NFA, 0 gun massacres in the 18 years after.\\n-“In the seven years before the NFA, the average annual firearm homicide rate per 100,000 was .43 (range .27 to .60) while for the seven years post NFA, the average annual firearm homicide rate was .25 (range .16 to .33).”\\n-“The number of homicide incidents involving a firearm decreased by 57 percent between 1989-90 and 2013-14”\\n\\n*This doesn't prove or disprove anything*  Whatever your opinion, I encourage everyone to do their own research. Have a great day, stay alive |-/",0,0
byA77xkQBEE,"I can't really comment on the laws and gun control in the United States as I have never been there.\\nThat being said. Being an Australian and living with our gun control laws that were implemented after only ONE mass shooting, I can send my nieces and nephews out in public without the constant thought of if they will be shot to death by someone who got their hands on a weapon because background checks weren't carried out correctly.\\nI have never understood why anyone would need Semi/Automatic weapon as personal protection and it shouldn't be allowed. \\nA small hand gun is good enough for your home and that is where they should stay. Locked up in your home, to protect you in your home.\\nEveryone spewing that any change to the laws regarding weapons will remove your freedoms... why do you need guns to be free? If you do, clearly you're not free and you should probably look at why you need a weapon to feel it.",0,0
byA77xkQBEE,"The shooter had no criminal record and was cleared of all background checks.  He purchased most(or all) of the guns legally.  Tell me, how could you have predicted that this one person would've committed the worst mass shooting in the US to date? The fact that he was able to get his hands on SO many weapons without a blip in the system goes to show the weakness in our system.  Yes, people kill people but guns facilitate the killing. A valid reason to have a single or limited firearm would be for instance, running a jewelry store. But the fact that this scum of the earth got his hands on so many guns without raising a red flag is the issue here.  If he had just a single handgun, there would be far fewer casualties.  \\n\\nIf other countries are able to implement effective gun control, eliminating future mass murder cases, why can't we? \\n\\nThe second point that Franco notes is also very important - the media is glorifying these killers. There should be laws for these criminals to remain unnamed and to focus solely on the victims.  People who commit crimes like these want the attention in their own very sick ways but we should wipe their existence from our minds and memories asap.",0,0

No apparent motive. Fuels fear, also fits with portrait of a professional.\\n\\n27 residences, a lot of money, seems like a CIA operative who had his background scrubbed and tailored. No political affiliation creates mystery and sews doubt on both sides. \\n\\nAll legal weapons and mods, things that can now be viably targeted by legislation.\\n\\nCarefully and intelligently planned, yet didn't disable smoke detectors? Wanted to be found. No military training yet looks like a professional job that's been designed to look just enough like a smart yet amateur job from the outside. Yet many small details indicate much more professional than led to believe.\\n\\nAt least 3-4 shooters, one reported at ground level. Very easy to replace windows. Shooting rate of 500 impossible in 10 minutes for one person. Most mass shootings leave only 1 man to take one for the team and get everything pinned on him. Knew he was gonna die.\\n\\nEntrances to concert venue all completely blocked except for one.\\n\\nWoman and man telling everyone they're gonna die. Both described as being much shorter than the shooter\\n\\nWhole scene looks picture perfect to make case for gun control. No need or use for 23 weapons in the hotel room, only two of which have the bump fire stock, when he could obviously afford to equip them all. only used a couple of them. No ak's visible in photos, where was the ak sounding weapon from the videos? Only 308 present was not equipped with bump stock, wasn't used. No security footage showing him bringing up multiple bags with so many. Where's all the expended brass if one person is supposed to have fired several thousand rounds alone? The amounts we see are small and scattered in spread out patterns and places they wouldn't be. At such a constant cycle the piles would be far more consistent, not just a couple here and a few there. Only a couple dozen on the floor.\\n\\nOnce shooting started stage lights lit up the crowd, illuminating them for the shooter.\\n\\nIsis claims responsibility but it's IMMEDIATELY dismissed by both fbi and CIA.

Maybe it's all the guns you have in America? Nah? Sorry But I really need to know something. Do Americans actually believe that guns make them safe? Or do they enjoy living in their own ignorance? As an Australian, I have never understood this issue. Australia had 1 mass shooting over 30 years ago and now guns are banned in Australia without very strong regulations and reasoning. How many people have to die for people to realise that guns are the problem. That there are as many guns in America as there are people. How many more mass shooting do you need to open your eyes? I never believed it when people said Americans where the most stupid people in the world...... But now I know I was wrong.",0,0
byA77xkQBEE,"Honestly what I think about this entire dilemma is that the guns aren't the ones killing people. IT'S THE PEOPLE KILLING EACH OTHER. So illegalizing the purchase of guns isn't gonna do jack-shit. People might agree, people might disagree, but this is once again, just my opinion. So don't go all super-sayian on my ass. The guy who started the shooting is American, which only makes things worse. And after the shooting he shot himself dead. But that didn't stop police from identifying him so his name and face is all over the news now. And as soon as the shooting was all over the news, guess what the unintelligent, stone-hearted people of the world did? OF COURSE THEY GO AND MAKE RUDE MEMES ABOUT IT! And that isn't cool! Same thing goes for 9/11 memes! They're not cool and need to be stopped! THREE TO FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED IN THE ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11th! 1 billion people across the world watched as the World Trade Center in New York City collapsed due to a hijacked passenger airplane crashing straight into it. Other hugely popular terrorist attacks get noticed as memes now! Examples are; The Boston Bombing, Charlottesville, The Paris Terrorist Attacks, and other catastrophic terrorist attacks. And we have lost some of the most life-changing people ever throughout the 21st century. For example; Steve Jobs (the creator of Apple) Hugh Hefner (the original creator of the ENTIRE Playboy franchise). Overall this is my take on all of this. So I shouldn't get hate. #PrayforVegas",0,0

The debt to China is massing in amounts that will make the U.S. a surrogate state with practically no political influence over Asia - and instead of having an honest discussion of why the American Dream has fallen so low, it seems like you squabble like children about who can read document from 1787 the best. \\nIt really is disheartening to see such a great country fall so low. I truly and honestly hope America finds its way back to a strong and just nation, looking out for its people, and the people around the world - but right now the dream of being the best country in the world is an illusion with practiaclly no justification behind it.",0,0

c3JbJmXInOs,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick’s existential catchphrase “Wubba Lubba Dub Dub,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂\\n\\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

Yes gun regulation needs a look at but if someone good has a gun at the right time and the right place that's lives that could be saved. Bad people will find a way and D-bags will be D-bags, nothing changes that, this guy might've been sick or whatever, doesn't change the fact he was a bad person and that he just needs to be forgotten, we remember the people affected and will honor their names but not the d-bag.",0,0

byA77xkQBEE,"So here's some evidence of the effectiveness of gun control laws, summarizing this article from a neutral source: \\n\\nhttp://www.factcheck.org/2017/10/gun-control-australia-updated/\\n\\n-Australia suffered a gun massacre in 1996: 35 dead, 18 injured.\\n-The National Firearms Agreement was passed as a result. Some semi-automatic rifles and shotguns were banned and stricter registration/licensing policies were implemented. There was also a huge amount of buybacks, and 700,000 guns were sold to the government. Laws were further tightened in 2002.\\n-There were 23% fewer homicides in 2013 than there were in 1996, though some fluctuation in between.\\n-13 gun massacres happened in the 18 years before the NFA, 0 gun massacres in the 18 years after.\\n-“In the seven years before the NFA, the average annual firearm homicide rate per 100,000 was .43 (range .27 to .60) while for the seven years post NFA, the average annual firearm homicide rate was .25 (range .16 to .33).”\\n-“The number of homicide incidents involving a firearm decreased by 57 percent between 1989-90 and 2013-14”\\n\\n*This doesn't prove or disprove anything*  Whatever your opinion, I encourage everyone to do their own research. Have a great day, stay alive |-/",0,0
byA77xkQBEE,"I can't really comment on the laws and gun control in the United States as I have never been there.\\nThat being said. Being an Australian and living with our gun control laws that were implemented after only ONE mass shooting, I can send my nieces and nephews out in public without the constant thought of if they will be shot to death by someone who got their hands on a weapon because background checks weren't carried out correctly.\\nI have never understood why anyone would need Semi/Automatic weapon as personal protection and it shouldn't be allowed. \\nA small hand gun is good enough for your home and that is where they should stay. Locked up in your home, to protect you in your home.\\nEveryone spewing that any change to the laws regarding weapons will remove your freedoms... why do you need guns to be free? If you do, clearly you're not free and you should probably look at why you need a weapon to feel it.",0,0
byA77xkQBEE,"The shooter had no criminal record and was cleared of all background checks.  He purchased most(or all) of the guns legally.  Tell me, how could you have predicted that this one person would've committed the worst mass shooting in the US to date? The fact that he was able to get his hands on SO many weapons without a blip in the system goes to show the weakness in our system.  Yes, people kill people but guns facilitate the killing. A valid reason to have a single or limited firearm would be for instance, running a jewelry store. But the fact that this scum of the earth got his hands on so many guns without raising a red flag is the issue here.  If he had just a single handgun, there would be far fewer casualties.  \\n\\nIf other countries are able to implement effective gun control, eliminating future mass murder cases, why can't we? \\n\\nThe second point that Franco notes is also very important - the media is glorifying these killers. There should be laws for these criminals to remain unnamed and to focus solely on the victims.  People who commit crimes like these want the attention in their own very sick ways but we should wipe their existence from our minds and memories asap.",0,0

Love getting my news from outlets like yours because I can see the unbiased truth unlike the news. \nEvery Country has flaws in their leadership and their government.  But the death of innocent people for any reason whatsoever is devastating.  Im not a gun person (out of smart decisions made by the government here) but I do understand protecting yourself and family in this age we live in.

Please read what an investigator sent me, quoted below.\\nVegas shooter:\\n\\nPerfect record, shows anyone can do it.\\n\\nAmassed guns starting when trump was elected.\\n\\nNo social media or traceable history OTHER than the perfect paper trail he left for the crime. No apparent motive. Fuels fear, also fits with portrait of a professional.\\n\\n27 residences, a lot of money, seems like a CIA operative who had his background scrubbed and tailored. No political affiliation creates mystery and sews doubt on both sides. \\n\\nAll legal weapons and mods, things that can now be viably targeted by legislation.\\n\\nCarefully and intelligently planned, yet didn't disable smoke detectors? Wanted to be found. No military training yet looks like a professional job that's been designed to look just enough like a smart yet amateur job from the outside. Yet many small details indicate much more professional than led to believe.\\n\\nAt least 3-4 shooters, one reported at ground level. Very easy to replace windows. Shooting rate of 500 impossible in 10 minutes for one person. Most mass shootings leave only 1 man to take one for the team and get everything pinned on him. Knew he was gonna die.\\n\\nEntrances to concert venue all completely blocked except for one.\\n\\nWoman and man telling everyone they're gonna die. Both described as being much shorter than the shooter\\n\\nWhole scene looks picture perfect to make case for gun control. No need or use for 23 weapons in the hotel room, only two of which have the bump fire stock, when he could obviously afford to equip them all. only used a couple of them. No ak's visible in photos, where was the ak sounding weapon from the videos? Only 308 present was not equipped with bump stock, wasn't used. No security footage showing him bringing up multiple bags with so many. Where's all the expended brass if one person is supposed to have fired several thousand rounds alone? The amounts we see are small and scattered in spread out patterns and places they wouldn't be. At such a constant cycle the piles would be far more consistent, not just a couple here and a few there. Only a couple dozen on the floor.\\n\\nOnce shooting started stage lights lit up the crowd, illuminating them for the shooter.\\n\\nIsis claims responsibility but it's IMMEDIATELY dismissed by both fbi and CIA.

byA77xkQBEE,"Anyone else see the leaked photos of the crime scene? Whole thing doesn't feel right.\\n1. The gunman definitely was shot through the mouth, but in the picture there are empty 5.56 casings.... on top of the blood splatter, with no blood on them. The means he was dead before the casings landed.\\n2. They claim he shot himself with a revolver. The revolver in the pictures next to him has no visible casings inside. It looks empty.\\n\\nFrom video footage of the shooting:\\n3. The rate of fire was not that of an AR platform. I have looked up videos of full auto ARs and ones with bump fire stocks like the media is claiming. Both shoot too fast. The rate of fire is almost exact to an M240 Light machine gun. Look up the guns for yourself on youtube. Compare it to the Vegas footage.\\n\\nI'm not usually a conspiracy theorist it just worries me that if there was a second shooter or if this guy got set up, the real killer is still out there and his trail is getting colder every day",0,0
byA77xkQBEE,"I have respect for the victims and the families victims and those who have been affected but I have no sympathy for the situation. Oh my god how did this happen? I wonder? Maybe it's all the guns you have in America? Nah? Sorry But I really need to know something. Do Americans actually believe that guns make them safe? Or do they enjoy living in their own ignorance? As an Australian, I have never understood this issue. Australia had 1 mass shooting over 30 years ago and now guns are banned in Australia without very strong regulations and reasoning. How many people have to die for people to realise that guns are the problem. That there are as many guns in America as there are people. How many more mass shooting do you need to open your eyes? I never believed it when people said Americans where the most stupid people in the world...... But now I know I was wrong.",0,0
byA77xkQBEE,"Honestly what I think about this entire dilemma is that the guns aren't the ones killing people. IT'S THE PEOPLE KILLING EACH OTHER. So illegalizing the purchase of guns isn't gonna do jack-shit. People might agree, people might disagree, but this is once again, just my opinion. So don't go all super-sayian on my ass. The guy who started the shooting is American, which only makes things worse. And after the shooting he shot himself dead. But that didn't stop police from identifying him so his name and face is all over the news now. And as soon as the shooting was all over the news, guess what the unintelligent, stone-hearted people of the world did? OF COURSE THEY GO AND MAKE RUDE MEMES ABOUT IT! And that isn't cool! Same thing goes for 9/11 memes! They're not cool and need to be stopped! THREE TO FOUR THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED IN THE ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11th! 1 billion people across the world watched as the World Trade Center in New York City collapsed due to a hijacked passenger airplane crashing straight into it. Other hugely popular terrorist attacks get noticed as memes now! Examples are; The Boston Bombing, Charlottesville, The Paris Terrorist Attacks, and other catastrophic terrorist attacks. And we have lost some of the most life-changing people ever throughout the 21st century. For example; Steve Jobs (the creator of Apple) Hugh Hefner (the original creator of the ENTIRE Playboy franchise). Overall this is my take on all of this. So I shouldn't get hate. #PrayforVegas",0,0
byA77xkQBEE,"there is no common sense about common sense gun control. the ONLY way to truly do what these people want would be to comb through the entire country and take everyone's guns by force. Even IF you could pass this law, I don't think you understand just what this would be asking of everyone involved or how much it would cost. And even IF we did that, found all the civilian guns and took them without starting a full on anarchy? we'd need to lock down borders to prevent smuggling guns in. We can NEVER say it won't happen again. we NEVER will. Sorry.",0,0
byA77xkQBEE,"I don't understand why its so hard to have an honest debate in America about gun control. A blanket gun ban has helped many countries become safer. I understand that the issue of black market guns would be a huge hurdle - but America is far from being a civilized nation with it's current course. \\nThe whole country is propped up on superficial industries (much more so than most first world nations), and the gun industry is one of them - I understand losing it would be a huge economical blow, which is what the right is afraid to admit - just as the left is afraid to admit that they do indeed want an all out gun ban. \\nWatching from the outside it seems like the spiral in the U.S. is just continuining, with major issues like distaster relief and the education system, the rehabilitation system for criminals, taxes and practically every major political issue being subverted to enhance the lifes of a few powerful people (left or right). The debt to China is massing in amounts that will make the U.S. a surrogate state with practically no political influence over Asia - and instead of having an honest discussion of why the American Dream has fallen so low, it seems like you squabble like children about who can read document from 1787 the best. \\nIt really is disheartening to see such a great country fall so low. I truly and honestly hope America finds its way back to a strong and just nation, looking out for its people, and the people around the world - but right now the dream of being the best country in the world is an illusion with practiaclly no justification behind it.",0,0

Wish people who have no fucking clue what's going on did some basic legwork before spewing nonsense. And those deliberately lying just stop. Also, if you want to talk gun control. How about you focus on making it harder to obtain illegal weapons, or obtaining weapons illegally in general. I get it, you want some regulations in place for how to legally obtaining weapons.

Yes gun regulation needs a look at but if someone good has a gun at the right time and the right place that's lives that could be saved. Bad people will find a way and D-bags will be D-bags, nothing changes that, this guy might've been sick or whatever, doesn't change the fact he was a bad person and that he just needs to be forgotten, we remember the people affected and will honor their names but not the d-bag.",0,0

byA77xkQBEE,"So here's some evidence of the effectiveness of gun control laws, summarizing this article from a neutral source: \\n\\nhttp://www.factcheck.org/2017/10/gun-control-australia-updated/\\n\\n-Australia suffered a gun massacre in 1996: 35 dead, 18 injured.\\n-The National Firearms Agreement was passed as a result. Some semi-automatic rifles and shotguns were banned and stricter registration/licensing policies were implemented. There was also a huge amount of buybacks, and 700,000 guns were sold to the government. Laws were further tightened in 2002.\\n-There were 23% fewer homicides in 2013 than there were in 1996, though some fluctuation in between.\\n-13 gun massacres happened in the 18 years before the NFA, 0 gun massacres in the 18 years after.\\n-“In the seven years before the NFA, the average annual firearm homicide rate per 100,000 was .43 (range .27 to .60) while for the seven years post NFA, the average annual firearm homicide rate was .25 (range .16 to .33).”\\n-“The number of homicide incidents involving a firearm decreased by 57 percent between 1989-90 and 2013-14”\\n\\n*This doesn't prove or disprove anything*  Whatever your opinion, I encourage everyone to do their own research. Have a great day, stay alive |-/",0,0
byA77xkQBEE,"I can't really comment on the laws and gun control in the United States as I have never been there.\\nThat being said. Being an Australian and living with our gun control laws that were implemented after only ONE mass shooting, I can send my nieces and nephews out in public without the constant thought of if they will be shot to death by someone who got their hands on a weapon because background checks weren't carried out correctly.\\nI have never understood why anyone would need Semi/Automatic weapon as personal protection and it shouldn't be allowed. \\nA small hand gun is good enough for your home and that is where they should stay. Locked up in your home, to protect you in your home.\\nEveryone spewing that any change to the laws regarding weapons will remove your freedoms... why do you need guns to be free? If you do, clearly you're not free and you should probably look at why you need a weapon to feel it.",0,0
byA77xkQBEE,"The shooter had no criminal record and was cleared of all background checks.  He purchased most(or all) of the guns legally.  Tell me, how could you have predicted that this one person would've committed the worst mass shooting in the US to date? The fact that he was able to get his hands on SO many weapons without a blip in the system goes to show the weakness in our system.  Yes, people kill people but guns facilitate the killing. A valid reason to have a single or limited firearm would be for instance, running a jewelry store. But the fact that this scum of the earth got his hands on so many guns without raising a red flag is the issue here.  If he had just a single handgun, there would be far fewer casualties.  \\n\\nIf other countries are able to implement effective gun control, eliminating future mass murder cases, why can't we? \\n\\nThe second point that Franco notes is also very important - the media is glorifying these killers. There should be laws for these criminals to remain unnamed and to focus solely on the victims.  People who commit crimes like these want the attention in their own very sick ways but we should wipe their existence from our minds and memories asap.",0,0

I understand that the issue of black market guns would be a huge hurdle - but America is far from being a civilized nation with it's current course. \\nThe whole country is propped up on superficial industries (much more so than most first world nations), and the gun industry is one of them - I understand losing it would be a huge economical blow, which is what the right is afraid to admit - just as the left is afraid to admit that they do indeed want an all out gun ban. \\nWatching from the outside it seems like the spiral in the U.S. is just continuining, with major issues like distaster relief and the education system, the rehabilitation system for criminals, taxes and practically every major political issue being subverted to enhance the lifes of a few powerful people (left or right). The debt to China is massing in amounts that will make the U.S. a surrogate state with practically no political influence over Asia - and instead of having an honest discussion of why the American Dream has fallen so low, it seems like you squabble like children about who can read document from 1787 the best. \\nIt really is disheartening to see such a great country fall so low. I truly and honestly hope America finds its way back to a strong and just nation, looking out for its people, and the people around the world - but right now the dream of being the best country in the world is an illusion with practiaclly no justification behind it.",0,0

I /did/ hear that in the upcoming seventh season, Rapunzel (a new version of her) will be featured, and said season is intended to focus on more Disney versions of fairy tales (including Tiana and a new Alice Liddel). Waaaaay too complicated for a simple YouTube comment, but it could mean that Disney's version of Rapunzel could appear with a few alterations. And Frozen was already featured in season 4 and included an explanation for Elsa's powers. Other than that, practically no serious divergence from the original movie, which could work out in the favor of a potential theory.",0,0

byA77xkQBEE,This is absurd that youtube was under attack by our own government just because people said and gave their own evidence that it was a conspiracy. This right here proves that the FBI and the US government do not want the public to think that for specific reasons. Certain posts were banned but if the theory of a conspiracy was under attack as it was then there is more to the story then what was told by mainstream news. Mr Paddock was not mentally ill. There was no surveillance footage released showing Stephen entering the hotel room or lobby with a suspicious arsenal of weapons.The investigation was rushed when the weapons were found in his room and he was the only one in there. He could have been a victim of a setup and used as a patsy which is highly plausible due to the information about uncovered about himself being a peaceful wealthy man. The investigation only used circumstantial evidence to pin the murders on Stephen Paddock. This smells fishy and you need hard forensic evidence to conclude an investigation. It is not hard to make a man look like he shot himself if you know what you are doing. I would say due to the lack of evidence in the investigation there is a high probability that there is something the US government does not want you to know. If this was a shooting committed by others the motive was clear to enforce strict regulations of Gun control and an excuse to go after countries that harbor members of Isis and any other terrorist groups alike.,0,0

Complete the picture by talking about the gunman. Calling him names or bad mouthing him is not going to help. In fact, he may have a mental disorder in which case we'd have to talk about mental disorders which means the most important human brains to talk about are the ones that actually did something like this, not just the ones that may theoretically be driven to.

One of news media trade marks is asking dumb question over and over and reporting what they want you to know and some times not reporting what you should know. The sports media have their little darling teams.that get most all the attention One has a losing season. That's okay, we'll make excuses.One bad or mediocre team has a good season and it takes half the season to be recognized or ranked. Let them lose one game; and they fall  of the ranking.

They figured this out with rapid gene array technology that looked at DNA, rather than trying to culture bacteria and viruses. What they found was that there were a lot more species of bacteria and viruses than were previously known, and that they are everywhere, including in areas of our bodies that used to be thought of as sterile, such as internal organs including the brain.

A man shall sculpt the vigor and ferocity of his nature in a constructive manner, and forsake the foolish temptations of his lesser kin. He shall express, and take to, the appreciation of the intellectual world and see his visions through this lens.\\nA man who illustrates his masculinity through the self-imposed privation of sexual gratification, and who glorifies the vulgar essence of the common being- yet eschews the refinement found within the most elite of intellect and culture- is not masculine, but juvenile.

Finn Wolfhard, an actor in the movie, who spent MONTHS of his life creating, tweeted at you telling you you shouldn’t be using your phone in the theatre. Then you act like he was mad at you for having an opinion on the movie, no, he said to NOT USE YOUR PHONE IN A THEATRE AS IT IS RUDE TO CREATORS AND THE PEOPLE AROUND YOU. you still play the innocent card, just stop that bullshit. Then Wyatt Oleff, another actor in the movie, makes a tweet regarding your toutorial, wyatt ended up on “okay” terms with you but i still stand with him, he said how you did a toutorial on the movie even though you hated it. another thing showing you only care about fame, if you don’t support something, don’t feature it on YOUR channel. that’s all i have to say, except, fuck you.",0,0

The sports media is the same as the alphabet channels, ABC NBC CBS MSNBC and CNN to name a few. Always giving their opinion instead of the news as it is. One of news media trade marks is asking dumb question over and over and reporting what they want you to know and some times not reporting what you should know. The sports media have their little darling teams.that get most all the attention One has a losing season. That's okay, we'll make excuses.One bad or mediocre team has a good season and it takes half the season to be recognized or ranked. Let them lose one game; and they fall  of the ranking. Let one of the little darling teams have a bad year and they keep them in the polls and make excuses the whole season. Think about it, what you hear is what the media wants you to hear..",1,0

But cousins def makes sense. \\n\\nI don't think Agnar was ever interested in magic though, given how he reacts to Elsa's magic (and he never goes back to them in later years either). I think he knew where to find the trolls because of his sister. Arianna was the explorer and researcher of magic. When they were children, she dragged him along, at some point, or maybe more than once, he met the trolls with her. That's how he knew to find them later.\\n\\nAlso this makes sense as to why Gothel couldn't eat the flower herself and retain its power. Clearly there is some sort of magic in Agnar and Ariannas family line. Not everyone has it but it appears in some. So that's why the cure helped Arianna (but didn't fundamentally change her) but Rapunzel had some gene or trait present within her that allowed the magic to take hold in her.

To see whether or not you have 2 right angles, place them against each other, it should make a straight line. This goes for wall brackets especially , tip, before you buy wall brackets, make sure they are 90 degrees. Some wall brackets have imperfections,  I've learned the hard way.

9yUZTTLpDtk,"A lot of my friends have issues with writing essays.  Their biggest concerns are length and structure.  Some of them are too wordy, some of them get right to the point, either way, they miss the word target by a fair margin.  The wordy ones can't make a concise point, the direct ones usually fail to explain their premises.  I frequently pull scores over 80, and into the 90s, and my uni is pretty brutal with the marking.  A 60-70 here means you've done well, but didn't go above and beyond.  You can write a perfect, but uninteresting essay and score up to a 70, to get beyond that, you have to show originality and novelty.  Anyway, given my scores, my friends frequently ask me for advice on how to get their scores up.  I say one thing makes for better essay writing, and that is practice.  Write long posts on Facebook, write long comments.  Eventually, the structure you'll need to follow will come naturally.  You'll be posting a thesis, followed by a bit of background information, some facts that support your position, and a logical extension of those facts into your conclusion.  It's that simple.  Write like you're surrounded by idiots.  Explain every jargon term you use, to make sure the reader knows you understand it, and is on precisely the same page.  In a philosophy essay, for example, it's not enough to say Camus was an existentialist, you have to expound and say what some features of existentialist philosophy are.  In a post about how Rick and Morty is nihilist, you explain what nihilism is, and what features of nihilism Rick and Morty displays.  At some point, you'll realise you can churn out a two thousand word essay on any topic, in one sitting.",0,0

The sports media is the same as the alphabet channels, ABC NBC CBS MSNBC and CNN to name a few. Always giving their opinion instead of the news as it is. One of news media trade marks is asking dumb question over and over and reporting what they want you to know and some times not reporting what you should know. The sports media have their little darling teams.that get most all the attention One has a losing season. That's okay, we'll make excuses.One bad or mediocre team has a good season and it takes half the season to be recognized or ranked. Let them lose one game; and they fall  of the ranking. Let one of the little darling teams have a bad year and they keep them in the polls and make excuses the whole season. Think about it, what you hear is what the media wants you to hear..",1,0

VC7ZqkV1_yw,"thank you for the video, but I have a question:\\n\\nis the concept of seeing masculinity per se as toxic really that prevalent? the vibe that I got from the term so far was it being used for situations in which men acted in a truly off-putting manner, e.g. one guy punching his friend in the arm full force as a gesture of bro banter, which I agreed just looked fucking creepy. the guy getting punched was clearly uncomfortable and in pain, but tried to act unimpressed so as not to lose face in front of his hyper-masculine friend. that is what I think toxic masculinity is commonly used to denote. I really don't have the impression masculinity per se is generally seen as a negative thing by most people even on the progressive left.\\n\\nwould be thankful for other people's perspectives. cheers. edit in case it means anything: I live in europe, not america.",0,0

VC7ZqkV1_yw,"Masculinity is civility: it is restrained, it exhibits self control and professes the mastery by which its model figures proceed to project  themselves upon the world. Masculinity is refinement, culture, and elegance: one who is truly masculine expresses the artistic precision of the human mind, and is not relegated to the brutishness of his primitive cousins. A man shall sculpt the vigor and ferocity of his nature in a constructive manner, and forsake the foolish temptations of his lesser kin. He shall express, and take to, the appreciation of the intellectual world and see his visions through this lens.\\nA man who illustrates his masculinity through the self-imposed privation of sexual gratification, and who glorifies the vulgar essence of the common being- yet eschews the refinement found within the most elite of intellect and culture- is not masculine, but juvenile. He lacks control, and limits the scope of his mind to petty luxury and lust. A man who does this is a boy, and not worth anything to the masculine image.",0,0

This predates hip-hop and goes right back to Elvis, Hendrix, and jazz/blues before them. There may have been some merit to it at one point. Blacks cared little for musical convention, and birthed some profoundly unorthodox, catchy and creative music. Since then there has been a slow decline in quality, despite rising popularity. At this point, some ghetto thug could take a shit on a microphone, and people would buy the recording. Rap and hip-hop are now creatively bankrupt genres for the most part, but that doesn't matter to the virtue signalling white kids, desperate for the prefect mix of street cred and social justice kudos.",1,0

iALfvFpcItE,"I was diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety Disorder in 2003. I was fresh out of HS, where I was a very outgoing and social person. Anxiety is debilitating. People look at you like you're either crazy, or on drugs. I was on Paxil for something like 10 years. I finally learned to somewhat control it by learning what triggers my attacks (driving at night, caffeine mainly, but other small things as well), and I found that for some reason, the sound of my mother's voice really helps me through a severe attack. All I have to do is call her up and she knows what to do lol. I've also taken up painting and/or drawing for those crappy middle-of-the-night attacks that like to creep up on me for no reason. I've managed to not have to take any medication for my anxiety since 2013. Everybody deals with anxiety differently but that's how I deal with mine if it helps anybody. It is helpful to know that I'm not the only one in the world going through it, because I don't know about anybody else but when I was diagnosed and even up to this day I feel like the most alone person in the world when I'm having an attack.",0,0

iALfvFpcItE,"Very informative and concise rundown. I have anxiety attributed to an old back injury and pinched nerve/nerves which pretty much hurt all the time, but it does vary. Pinched nerves=nerveousness as I've experienced it, but also can cause other strange neurological symptoms such as difficulty in moving and slurred speech. It can be really horrible when people think you're drunk when you haven't been drinking by unsteady movements and the slurring. Anti inflammatories help tremendously alongisde inversion therapy (hanging upside down.) Relaxing the spine will typically and temporarily relieve my anxiety to a degree, but also the troubles with speech and movement. Ultimately, my body responds with adrenaline (since I won't take prescription painkillers on principle) which comes with it's own set of problems... including anxiety! So that's just me, but it hopefully adds another (strictly subjective) facet to the reasons explained in the video.",0,0

The sports media have their little darling teams.that get most all the attention One has a losing season. That's okay, we'll make excuses.One bad or mediocre team has a good season and it takes half the season to be recognized or ranked. Let them lose one game; and they fall  of the ranking.

VC7ZqkV1_yw,"Masculinity is civility: it is restrained, it exhibits self control and professes the mastery by which its model figures proceed to project  themselves upon the world. Masculinity is refinement, culture, and elegance: one who is truly masculine expresses the artistic precision of the human mind, and is not relegated to the brutishness of his primitive cousins. A man shall sculpt the vigor and ferocity of his nature in a constructive manner, and forsake the foolish temptations of his lesser kin. He shall express, and take to, the appreciation of the intellectual world and see his visions through this lens.\\nA man who illustrates his masculinity through the self-imposed privation of sexual gratification, and who glorifies the vulgar essence of the common being- yet eschews the refinement found within the most elite of intellect and culture- is not masculine, but juvenile. He lacks control, and limits the scope of his mind to petty luxury and lust. A man who does this is a boy, and not worth anything to the masculine image.",0,0

VC7ZqkV1_yw,"Respectfully, you completely missed one of the primary reasons for the success of hip-hop, namely white people desperately trying to buy into black (American) culture. This predates hip-hop and goes right back to Elvis, Hendrix, and jazz/blues before them. There may have been some merit to it at one point. Blacks cared little for musical convention, and birthed some profoundly unorthodox, catchy and creative music. Since then there has been a slow decline in quality, despite rising popularity. At this point, some ghetto thug could take a shit on a microphone, and people would buy the recording. Rap and hip-hop are now creatively bankrupt genres for the most part, but that doesn't matter to the virtue signalling white kids, desperate for the prefect mix of street cred and social justice kudos.",1,0

i3-Nf3cxlmg,"What are you all talking about? This was not an exciting game. It was 4 hours and 30 minutes of some of the sloppiest play I have personally ever seen. \\nThe Cubs tried so much to basically hand the game to the Nationals, but time and time again, whether it was errors, awful hitting, or just bad baseball, the Nationals blew it. Lots of missed opportunities, bad play, an overall crappy game. If you enjoyed this, that is okay. However, if you think this was a good game, you clearly aren't an avid baseball fan. \\n\\nIt's clear that either of these teams aren't going to make it to the world series anyway after a game like this. Can't believe the Dodgers will be given the opportunity to FINALLY make a world series. If they blow this, they truly are the laughing stalk of baseball. The Cubs are a fundamentally flawed team this year. I love Joe Maddon, but their bullpen is garbage, rotation questionable at best, and none of their offensive performers are quite as good as they were last year. Both of the teams in the ALCS are much more solid teams than either of these. It upsets me to see games like this. Hopefully the CS's and World Series will be much better to watch.",1,2

iALfvFpcItE,"I honestly never thought anxiety was this much of an issue for people!? I get how school can stress people out, but most of the time it's over an assignment or essay that was given on a tight deadline. Yes, at times that can be stressful, but to say that it has caused you to experience a mental disease that apparently last up to 6 months??  Really? Most of the time you get a majority of the material to study or in some cases an example of the essay or assignment. I always thought procrastination has been the battle for people in school since if you think about it, isn't putting off something for too long a way of contributing towards the stress of the essay/assignment? Honestly at the end of the day you're stressing of school while people in other places are stressing to SURVIVE, why do people always think their current problem trumps all other problems regardless of how ridiculous it turns out to be.  Work gives me so much anxiety, it takes a lot out of me everyday. I don't know why I even work here... (Is what I imagine people with anxiety feel) my answer  Get a new job.  Problem solved",0,0
iALfvFpcItE,"I had this problem until I realized I had a big, huge TAPEWORM. Seriously. But when I changed to an anti-parasitic diet, my anxiety levels plummeted. Get off the pharms and sugar cause they make you wormy. Eat a whole foods diet like they did in the old days. All the advice modern med gives is dead wrong and the opposite of what you should do. These pharms for anxiety end up making it worse long term because it feeds your parasites, calming down your system, but then they are stronger and your body is more stressed overall. Fat is great at fighting parasites, so we are told not to eat it. Etc. Etc.",0,0

iALfvFpcItE,"It's all chemical? Wow, people like these on this channel continue to tell us that anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, etc. are caused by some sort of chemical imbalance. I've talked to numerous people on medication with these problem and I ask why the pills arent fixing it. No answer so far. Why don't we just fix the 'chemical imbalance' in us and the depression will go away? Because it's more than that! These 'therapists' do nothing but tell you what in life makes your anxious/sad and teach you to forget about it. Depression, etc. could mean your soul is in trouble. If you are dead inside, your physical body might crave death also. In more mild cases, sinful goals often give way to anxiety (wanting to look good, wanting more money, etc.). Jesus Christ is fulfillment. He is the answer to all of your problems. You are evil, you have done evil. You failed. You are no match for sin, or temptations. He DIED for you. He PAID your fine. Please do not pass off this glorious opportunity. Accept Him into your heart. Believe that Jesus is your Lord and Savior, and all of your sins are forgiven. No need to worry or be sad about anything.

I'm not sure.

It’s part of my female icons series - I would be thrilled if you could comment and watch it. I’m a massive fan of you and have been following your work for a number of years which has inspired me to go into makeup myself. My YouTube channel is Laura Gask. Thank you for your time.",0,0

LSYc5HvyXKo,"It's such a joy for me to see Claudia's make-up being applied, and it's also a treat to see how *even more* exquisite she has grown over the years :) It is hard for me to quantify 'why' and 'how', but maturity really does enhance one's beauty; perhaps it is the lack of self-consciousness or the ease of one's smile... I'm not sure. But whether our friends and family would describe us as beautiful, interesting, or even kind is not so much the point as living a good and honest life ― a life of love, generosity and spiritedness ― I firmly believe that this shows in our appearance :)",0,0

But back in 1986, while employed as a systems administrator at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Stoll investigated a tenacious hacker, one who stole $0.75 of computer time (back when you had to rent computer time-no one owned computers back then)—later identified as a KGB agent—who stole passwords, pirated multiple computer accounts, and attempted to breach US military security. \\n\\nStoll was tenacious and needed to KNOW even then-I mean, how many people would devote months trying to find a $0.75 accounting error?\\n\\nAfter identifying the intrusion, Stoll set up a honeypot for Hess, eventually tracking him down and passing details to the authorities. It is recognized as one of the first examples of digital forensics. He described the events of his investigation in The Cuckoo's Egg: Tracking a Spy Through the Maze of Computer Espionage, which was a huge international best seller, and is an excellent book that I highly recommend.",0,0

jkrrdsEzi-s,I know she lives in California but come on? Like really? Maybe those are the only stores near her. I can get that but where is Kohls? JCP? Peebles? TJ Max? I can find some amazing deals without even trying. I usually use coupons anyways when I shop and Promo codes. I guess I am not into these trendy cheep things. I absolutely hate Forever21. They have the worst clothing that you can possibly buy because their quality is so low. Plus their prices are high for the nice pieces. I saw some of their dresses going for 50 dollars. When I can get clearance dresses for 20 that has amazing quality.  So far I have bought 3 dresses on clearance that are for the winter. They all retail for about 70 to 110 dollars before they were marked down or on deep discount. I technically count thrift stores as just big sale stores to. I have found amazing high quality things in there. I recently bought 2 suits that has both matching blazers and skirts. They are super high quality and paid 4 dollars each for them. I got another sharp navy blazer I paid 6.00 for. I also bought a nice brown wool coat for 6.99. Then I went to a rummage sale and bought my boyfriend 2 wool high quality fancy made in the USA suit jackets for a dollar each! Plus a pair of expensive black dress pants for also a dollar. I also got myself a metal purse for just a dollar. I know we live in different places but surely there are some great deals in California.,0,0

iALfvFpcItE,I’m 18 and my boyfriend was just in a terrible car accident killing his best friend and leaving himself in a coma. I was wondering if you guys could do a video on traumatic brain injuries? More specifically diffuse axonal brain injuries please.,0,0
iALfvFpcItE,Hey I'm new here so I'm not sure if you've done a video on this but I think it would be really cool if ya'll could do a video on how experiences in childhood affect your life and relationships later on.,0,0
iALfvFpcItE,"I developed anxiety attacks over a long period of time that came to a head many years ago when I had one of several panic attacks.  After dealing with this for over a decade, a new thing happened: agoraphobia.  I now don't leave my apartment unless I absolutely have to.  I no longer grocery shop nor do even go for a casual walk as each of these cause anxiety and panic - and for no known reason at all.  I take an SSRI daily but that doesn't do much except even out my moods so I no longer feel particularly happy or overly sad about anything as a result.  The worst part about this: I'm not alone.  There are so many others in the same situation as I am where our quality of life has been dramatically compromised.  I've lost most of my friends (since I can't visit them nor can I go out with them anymore for fun).  I certainly haven't met anyone that I could share my life with (how could I).  I buy most of my food at a convenience store because it's close by and I can quickly go there, grab something and come home again.  This is my life, or more accurately, my existence.  Anyone that thinks those of us that suffer with this _want_ to be like this are the ones that need to have their head examined.  Often, we are told that we need to pull our socks up, man-up, get over it, etc., or are asked things like What are you afraid of? Do you think people are watching and whispering? What is your problem? and don't understand when they get answers like I don't know what there is to fear: nothing, as far as I know.  This just happens.  No I don't think people are staring and whispering; I'm not paranoid or suffering delusions.  If I knew what my problem was do you not think I'd have addressed it already head on?  Then they wonder why we get upset and don't want to be around them.  To make this problem even worse, none of us experience this the same way.  One person's experience with anxiety and panic could be radically different from my own.  Sadly, we're all treated the same way.  Broken.",0,0
iALfvFpcItE,"i figured i was going to comment along the lines of what a load of bollocks!\\nbeing somebody who suffers anxiety for a host of reasons, along with depression, i get a bit sick of the whole change your diet, think positive! type of crap that appears on the net. \\nyou didnt do that. \\nthankyou!",0,0

jkrrdsEzi-s,I know she lives in California but come on? Like really? Maybe those are the only stores near her. I can get that but where is Kohls? JCP? Peebles? TJ Max? I can find some amazing deals without even trying. I usually use coupons anyways when I shop and Promo codes. I guess I am not into these trendy cheep things. I absolutely hate Forever21. They have the worst clothing that you can possibly buy because their quality is so low. Plus their prices are high for the nice pieces. I saw some of their dresses going for 50 dollars. When I can get clearance dresses for 20 that has amazing quality.  So far I have bought 3 dresses on clearance that are for the winter. They all retail for about 70 to 110 dollars before they were marked down or on deep discount. I technically count thrift stores as just big sale stores to. I have found amazing high quality things in there. I recently bought 2 suits that has both matching blazers and skirts. They are super high quality and paid 4 dollars each for them. I got another sharp navy blazer I paid 6.00 for. I also bought a nice brown wool coat for 6.99. Then I went to a rummage sale and bought my boyfriend 2 wool high quality fancy made in the USA suit jackets for a dollar each! Plus a pair of expensive black dress pants for also a dollar. I also got myself a metal purse for just a dollar. I know we live in different places but surely there are some great deals in California.,0,0

I'm not sure. But whether our friends and family would describe us as beautiful, interesting, or even kind is not so much the point as living a good and honest life ― a life of love, generosity and spiritedness ― I firmly believe that this shows in our appearance :)",0,0

iALfvFpcItE,"I developed anxiety attacks over a long period of time that came to a head many years ago when I had one of several panic attacks.  After dealing with this for over a decade, a new thing happened: agoraphobia.  I now don't leave my apartment unless I absolutely have to.  I no longer grocery shop nor do even go for a casual walk as each of these cause anxiety and panic - and for no known reason at all.  I take an SSRI daily but that doesn't do much except even out my moods so I no longer feel particularly happy or overly sad about anything as a result.  The worst part about this: I'm not alone.  There are so many others in the same situation as I am where our quality of life has been dramatically compromised.  I've lost most of my friends (since I can't visit them nor can I go out with them anymore for fun).  I certainly haven't met anyone that I could share my life with (how could I).  I buy most of my food at a convenience store because it's close by and I can quickly go there, grab something and come home again.  This is my life, or more accurately, my existence.  Anyone that thinks those of us that suffer with this _want_ to be like this are the ones that need to have their head examined.  Often, we are told that we need to pull our socks up, man-up, get over it, etc., or are asked things like What are you afraid of? Do you think people are watching and whispering? What is your problem? and don't understand when they get answers like I don't know what there is to fear: nothing, as far as I know.  This just happens.  No I don't think people are staring and whispering; I'm not paranoid or suffering delusions.  If I knew what my problem was do you not think I'd have addressed it already head on?  Then they wonder why we get upset and don't want to be around them.  To make this problem even worse, none of us experience this the same way.  One person's experience with anxiety and panic could be radically different from my own.  Sadly, we're all treated the same way.  Broken.",0,0

iALfvFpcItE,"I developed anxiety attacks over a long period of time that came to a head many years ago when I had one of several panic attacks.  After dealing with this for over a decade, a new thing happened: agoraphobia.  I now don't leave my apartment unless I absolutely have to.  I no longer grocery shop nor do even go for a casual walk as each of these cause anxiety and panic - and for no known reason at all.  I take an SSRI daily but that doesn't do much except even out my moods so I no longer feel particularly happy or overly sad about anything as a result.  The worst part about this: I'm not alone.  There are so many others in the same situation as I am where our quality of life has been dramatically compromised.  I've lost most of my friends (since I can't visit them nor can I go out with them anymore for fun).  I certainly haven't met anyone that I could share my life with (how could I).  I buy most of my food at a convenience store because it's close by and I can quickly go there, grab something and come home again.  This is my life, or more accurately, my existence.  Anyone that thinks those of us that suffer with this _want_ to be like this are the ones that need to have their head examined.  Often, we are told that we need to pull our socks up, man-up, get over it, etc., or are asked things like What are you afraid of? Do you think people are watching and whispering? What is your problem? and don't understand when they get answers like I don't know what there is to fear: nothing, as far as I know.  This just happens.  No I don't think people are staring and whispering; I'm not paranoid or suffering delusions.  If I knew what my problem was do you not think I'd have addressed it already head on?  Then they wonder why we get upset and don't want to be around them.  To make this problem even worse, none of us experience this the same way.  One person's experience with anxiety and panic could be radically different from my own.  Sadly, we're all treated the same way.  Broken.",0,0

Other conditions however, like infections and auto-immune diseases are not strictly related to the aging process. Life extension shouldn't affect the development of these conditions and as such doesn't necessarily entail being healthy or disease-free, but rather being able to resist them as well as the healthiest and most resilient version of yourself.\\nP.S Zeus is a colossal asshole.",0,0

Food and water resources would become extinct, and many people would die due to famine or drought. \\n\\nDeforestation would accelarate and we would run out of fossil fuel pretty quickly. Our only chance at survival would be colonizing Mars, but still, only a handful of people would make it there. \\n\\nConclusion: we would ruin our world even more than we're doing now if our selfish wish of becoming immortal would ever become reality",1,0

It wouldn't be so great if stuck-in-the-past older people get to stay in power for longer periods of time.  We have a hard time advancing now, imagine if the Strom Thurmonds of our generation get to stay in their seats of governmental control for centuries.  We would halt, philosophically, as a species.  Technologically we'd advance, but that's about it, as technology zooms forward, all the people using that tech would just freeze in place because they will not be people who have been growing up with the newer tech.\\n\\nOr we eventually starve ourselves out of everything.  Let's not forget that resource management would be an even bigger problem than it is now, and it's pretty bad *now.*  We are not ready, as a species, to live for centuries at a time.

Theres a cycle set up for aging. Being in my 40s now that thrill i felt as a kid is gone, i dont really enjoy hardly anything anymore. Ive watched movies to death, played all the video games, ive seen it all before and am bored. Every time i hear of a shooting i think how lucky that person was and when will it be my turn. I want to die in shock, looking at the sky not of old age or cancer. Its odd like running into bears or other life threatening situations its not bravery but more like i dont care, im dead inside. What i wouldnt give to go back and do it again though, to be young and have so much new but the only way to do that is to learn it all again and start from 0 again.

vpsP_cg8urU,"My analysis on his play is that it speaks volumes about him as a player and the league as a whole. He didn't exert very much force in his play, which is a great thing, because it proves two things: he has talent/finesse and that he isn't playing revenge ball to prove a point to anyone. Good for him. \\n\\nBut the sad part (this is a subjective opinion) is the that western conference right now is an absolute fucking joke. Besides the Spurs, Thunder, and Warriors, it's a mess. You can make the claim that the Rockets are great (and they did hit more three-pointers than the Warriors last season), but I don't think they're going to get very much done against the Spurs (meaning they won't amount for much a challenge against the Warriors). Like how much fire must the Suns have been lacking to just let a rookie game up 29 fucking points...

Where is the rest of humanity? Who is this person? Do they know each other? Are all of Hayley’s friends just hanging around waiting for her? Is there a reason they stopped?\\n\\nAnd why are there two people standing up whilst the car is moving? What about seat-belts and general safe driving? \\n\\nActually, why are they all there in the first place? Where is this video shot? Is this all in some other dimension where camera angles are just slightly off and everything is not – quite – right?\\n\\nAnd why did one of the people jump out of the car, grab their skateboard, and then proceed to just stand there? And why are they all wearing headphones? And what’s up with the matching fabric patches? Are they in some kind of gang?\\n\\nAnd where did Hayley's headphones go?\\n\\nAnd why doesn't the person put the roof on their car before they go off? AND WHY ARE THERE BUBBLES?
