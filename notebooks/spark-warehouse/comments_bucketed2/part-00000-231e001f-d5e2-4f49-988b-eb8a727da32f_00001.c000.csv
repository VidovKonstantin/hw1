Ayb_2qbZHm4,"So I used to live right in front of the tour room aka mint condition room. Anyway, the thing is many many parents take a an opportunity to peek and even take pictures of our room when clearly someone is in the room!  Please don't open or peak into other people's room! or even try to open closed room! It is common for us to leave our doors slightly open for other dormmates to come by and say hi to hang out! We don't mind if you are in the hallway, but if you push the door like a creep and take a picture? We have a problem. Also, we know for sure that the tour guys have warned to not open our doors or peak inside because they know 1/50 parents do this and out of many tour guys are our own dormmates.",1,0

xtDJ6uEyvnw,"some people seem to assume that this guy is making these facial expressions out of humor during ¬†very traumatic time. Exaggerated facial expressions are forms of grammar necessary in Sign Language to make sure those who need it understand the severity of the situation. It may seem funny to us but its fairly common for this to be done. I think its awesome and I can totally see the humor and if people take that, thats cool but understand this isn't being done to mock or joke about the situation. He is doing his job as best as he could and I feel he did it brilliantly.",36,3
xtDJ6uEyvnw,To all viewers who do not know American Sign Language:I am deaf and use American Sign Language (ASL). This guy is doing a fantastic job of interpreting for the deaf! His facial adverbs equate with the spoken inflection and gravity of the emergency situation. Hurricane Irma is a serious threat and it cannot be taken lightly. This certified deaf interpreter just conveyed that.,7,0
xtDJ6uEyvnw,His facial expressions enhanced his explaining.....I thought he explained this dam good.,5,0
xtDJ6uEyvnw,He's a Cerified deaf interpreter (CDI). He does not hear the noises he's making. How it works is a hearing interpreter sits in front of the deaf interpreter and signs what is being said. The Deaf interpreter then interprets that into American Sign Language. Deaf interpreters are used because a native user/speaker of a language can convey the meaning clearer than a non-native native signer. Deaf interpreters are the best choice in a emergency situation (and many other situations) to meet the communication needs of the entire Deaf Community. There are different dialects of sign language. This interpreter interpreted the information in a way that any deaf person can understand...which is the point.,30,5
xtDJ6uEyvnw,I would like this guy to translate everything I say.,3,0
xtDJ6uEyvnw,This guy just made about 900 GIFs.,9,0

xtDJ6uEyvnw,..You hoax people know nothing first  in some cause 's they use facial expression  like in Florida ..Know the  facts before you credits some thing that you know nothing about . sing langue,0,0
xtDJ6uEyvnw,"You should probably amend that to Gov Rick Scott gives a warning with ASL (American Sign Language) interpreter, emphasizing the seriousness the situation for the deaf/hard of hearing audience. ¬†There IS a difference - putting deaf first implies that the interpreter cannot hear, which is obviously false since he is listening to Gov Scott and interpreting into signs.\\n\\nEdited to add: ¬†I saw Pam's comment. I stand corrected.",3,2
xtDJ6uEyvnw,Is this like Dolby surround sound for the deaf?,0,0
xtDJ6uEyvnw,People don't realize that he isn't being overly enthusiastic or anything like that. This is just sign language. That is what sign language looks like. You use facial expressions like a hearing person might use vocal pitch. I love ASL so much becasue of that!,0,0

xtDJ6uEyvnw,HE FORGOT THE 7 IN THE PHONE NUMBER- EPIC FAIL?,1,0
xtDJ6uEyvnw,"Pause at 0:58, hilarious with his tongue out. Yes, I'm well aware that's the only way to emphasize in sign language, but still, it's funny. But what's even funnier is what is the point of all the men just standing around the governor like statues, it's pointless. Just have governor Scott and the signer up there.",2,0
xtDJ6uEyvnw,"He's one of a few that caught my eye.  I agree, he's a great bit of humorous uplift in times of such gravity.  Highly likely that he signs this exact way every time he signs - no matter who is watching.",1,0

xtDJ6uEyvnw,WTF did I just watch? How did the governor make it through his speech with that going on next to him? This guy reminds me of Mr. Bean.,4,1
xtDJ6uEyvnw,"He is the real deal and he is good.  He is a CDI.  I recently took a workshop he taught. To the untrained eye, his facial expressions are funny or weird.  But to native signers, those facial expressions are the most important part of the language.  They are the equivalent of vocal tone and punctuation.  Interpreting students have to learn these facial expressions.  It takes months -> years to learn this.  You want funny, you should see a class of new interpreters practicing facial expressions.  Also, there is a lot of work here.  The speaker, the off camera interpreter (who can hear) signing to him, so he can interpret the msg. and sign it in ASL. W/O facial expressions he's like a monotone speaker who says uh every other word.  Chinese sounds funny to me too, but that's because I don't know the language.",0,1

xtDJ6uEyvnw,"Just like the global warming scam, this guy proves these deaf people have just been fucking with us all along.  *waves arms wildly*",4,1
xtDJ6uEyvnw,This has to be some nut that pretended to be the sign language guy or whatever they are. This is like a SNL skit. There's no way this was real,3,4
xtDJ6uEyvnw,I think this is over the top. It distracts the viewer from listening to the important message given by the Governor. How can a serious message possibly be 'translated' by such weird facial expressions? His expressions don't seem to match the words.,3,9
xtDJ6uEyvnw,Is the tongue really necessary,1,2
xtDJ6uEyvnw,"I am deaf. His expression is not funny, it is the expression of seriousness of the hurricane and he is signing in true ASL that covers all levels of communication of the deaf. There are level of communication that come within the culture where there are spectrum of deaf level of understanding. It appears whoever post this lacks understanding of the deaf culture and it's situation. I assume you are hearing and do understand that you see only the expression and not it's signs that are visual and representable to the context of the language and situation that is happening that could save the lives of the deaf community. I hope this provides an insight to change your title of the topic of the video.",2,2

xtDJ6uEyvnw,"some people seem to assume that this guy is making these facial expressions out of humor during ¬†very traumatic time. Exaggerated facial expressions are forms of grammar necessary in Sign Language to make sure those who need it understand the severity of the situation. It may seem funny to us but its fairly common for this to be done. I think its awesome and I can totally see the humor and if people take that, thats cool but understand this isn't being done to mock or joke about the situation. He is doing his job as best as he could and I feel he did it brilliantly.",41,6
xtDJ6uEyvnw,To all viewers who do not know American Sign Language:I am deaf and use American Sign Language (ASL). This guy is doing a fantastic job of interpreting for the deaf! His facial adverbs equate with the spoken inflection and gravity of the emergency situation. Hurricane Irma is a serious threat and it cannot be taken lightly. This certified deaf interpreter just conveyed that.,7,0
xtDJ6uEyvnw,His facial expressions enhanced his explaining.....I thought he explained this dam good.,5,0
xtDJ6uEyvnw,He's a Cerified deaf interpreter (CDI). He does not hear the noises he's making. How it works is a hearing interpreter sits in front of the deaf interpreter and signs what is being said. The Deaf interpreter then interprets that into American Sign Language. Deaf interpreters are used because a native user/speaker of a language can convey the meaning clearer than a non-native native signer. Deaf interpreters are the best choice in a emergency situation (and many other situations) to meet the communication needs of the entire Deaf Community. There are different dialects of sign language. This interpreter interpreted the information in a way that any deaf person can understand...which is the point.,31,6

I stand corrected.",3,2

xtDJ6uEyvnw,"He's one of a few that caught my eye.  I agree, he's a great bit of humorous uplift in times of such gravity.  Highly likely that he signs this exact way every time he signs - no matter who is watching.",1,0

xtDJ6uEyvnw,"He is the real deal and he is good.  He is a CDI.  I recently took a workshop he taught. To the untrained eye, his facial expressions are funny or weird.  But to native signers, those facial expressions are the most important part of the language.  They are the equivalent of vocal tone and punctuation.  Interpreting students have to learn these facial expressions.  It takes months -> years to learn this.  You want funny, you should see a class of new interpreters practicing facial expressions.  Also, there is a lot of work here.  The speaker, the off camera interpreter (who can hear) signing to him, so he can interpret the msg. and sign it in ASL. W/O facial expressions he's like a monotone speaker who says uh every other word.  Chinese sounds funny to me too, but that's because I don't know the language.",0,1
xtDJ6uEyvnw,"Just like the global warming scam, this guy proves these deaf people have just been fucking with us all along.  *waves arms wildly*",4,1

xtDJ6uEyvnw,This has to be some nut that pretended to be the sign language guy or whatever they are. This is like a SNL skit. There's no way this was real,3,4
xtDJ6uEyvnw,Is that real sign language or is this guy clowning around making gibberish?,0,3
xtDJ6uEyvnw,"I am deaf. His expression is not funny, it is the expression of seriousness of the hurricane and he is signing in true ASL that covers all levels of communication of the deaf. There are level of communication that come within the culture where there are spectrum of deaf level of understanding. It appears whoever post this lacks understanding of the deaf culture and it's situation. I assume you are hearing and do understand that you see only the expression and not it's signs that are visual and representable to the context of the language and situation that is happening that could save the lives of the deaf community. I hope this provides an insight to change your title of the topic of the video.",2,2
xtDJ6uEyvnw,I think this is over the top. It distracts the viewer from listening to the important message given by the Governor. How can a serious message possibly be 'translated' by such weird facial expressions? His expressions don't seem to match the words.,3,9

He used to sing it as well with his men during WW2 a lot. You can choose between the original German version or sing it in English of course. There are also two ways to sing it, either a more slow and sad solo or a duet that's much more upbeat and happy. Much care from Deutschland! Love your work and thank you! There is the Marlene Dietrich 1915 version, and then there's a 1939 version, plus the versions out there of soldiers singing it.

I learned all the words and everything, but for some reason I never checked out any of Nathan's other songs or took in the lyrics even though they were so meaningful. But when I finally knew what it felt like to feel depressed and suicidal, I was chilling outside trying to find a way to cope with all of the pain, and that's when I found Logic's 1-800 song I was blown away. I looked at the comments of that video (it was the audio not the music video) and found somebody saying that if they liked logic than they would definitely like NF - Therapy Session. Me being curious I checked him out not even realizing I had a couple of songs by him already. Therapy Session was the song that made me fall in love with NF and his music. He has helped me so much, and is the reason I have chose to keep going. I'm not out of my bad place and I don't think I will be ok for a long time, but when I need an escape Nathan is here for me like he is with many others.

Ayb_2qbZHm4,"College is for, how I see it,¬†two types of people. 1) You are striving for a career in the future that requires you to have a degree. For example, I plan to become a pilot in the near future, but nearly every big commercial company requires a bachelors degree in aeronautical science (or something similar) from an accredited university. 2) You are going there to expand on your already well established career in order to either learn more, or obtain a degree you need in order to move higher up in the chain for your company. In my opinion, if you are not apart of those two categories, then college might be really risky and I wouldn't recommend it that much. Of course it might be useful if you are going to get a stem degree, but make sure you have a solid plan after that.\\n\\nOn another note, those who say college is way too expensive to go into are not entirely true. Let me explain the situation I went through after my recent high school graduation. I planned on going to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University for my aeronautical science degree, since it was pretty famous for both its engineering and flight paths. I got accepted and even got a top not presidential scholarship of 15k. However, it was to expensive for me to get into still (total price of first years is about 45k). So I looked into my own state (Colorado) and found MSU. The campus when I went looked awesome, close to two stadiums and an amusement park in the heart of the city. Not only that, but an all access RTD (light rail, bus, basically transportation)¬†was included within the tuition. It also includes an aeronautical science course, and being within 50 miles of Denver international airport it has some pretty good reputation. Without the scholarship, 1 year is only 7k for Colorado residents...¬† Bottom line is, yes college can be VERY expensive, but it can be reasonably low cost as well. Just make sure you research well before you decide on your pick.",0,0

5jRYB3nGxmc,"Sept. 15. After 13 years in orbit, NASA's Cassini spacecraft made a fateful plunge into Saturn's atmosphere early Friday morning, ending the mission just one month shy of its 20th launch anniversary. Earth received @Cassini-Saturn's final signal at 7:55 a.m. ET (1155 GMT). Cassini is now part of the planet it studied, Cassini's team said on Twitter Friday morning. The probe was running low on fuel, so the 13-year tour of the Saturn system mission had to end. The spacecraft made a deliberate plunge into Saturn's atmosphere to avoid the small possibility of it crashing into a potentially habitable moon, in particular Enceladus. Launched in 1997, the 3.26-billion-U.S.-dollar Cassini-Huygens mission has been touring the Saturn system since arriving there in 2004. The Huygens lander separated from Cassini and plopped down on the surface of Saturn's moon Titan shortly after the arrival.The Cassini probe had been scheduled to study the Saturn system until 2008, but the mission was given two extensions that stretched its lifetime into 2017.During its journey, Cassini has made numerous dramatic discoveries. Discoveries are available online if viewers are inclined-ly interested to know more. Have a nicely brewed hot coffee.",0,0

5jRYB3nGxmc,"‚ÄúI have a friend who's an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say look how beautiful it is, and I'll agree. Then he says I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing, and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts.‚Äù\\n\\n‚Äï Richard Feynman",2,0

3la8bsi4P-c,"sorry this is bullshit. snoop doesn't miss the point it's pretty lame that everyone has the same fundamental flow. that was the case in the 80s when hip hop was new and much smaller so it was okay. in the 90s what separated everyone the real heavy hitters was different flow. every single person has the same flow that is relevant now. very little variation. also - some total inaccurate music history. the origin of triplets dates back to India, not Africa. African traditional folk beats are not even close to being the origin of the swing of triplets which really comes from India. That is the true source. 6/8 patterns on hand drums. It spread to Persia then the whole Middle East and eventually made it's way into Arabic music which is the root of Latin music. So the way triplets are implemented in hip hop flow is a 6/8 groove which is based on triplets. If you're gonna make an entire special segment on music theory, please do better research than some dumbass blogger who states it comes from Africa when he is not even close.",0,0

Ayb_2qbZHm4,"College is for, how I see it,¬†two types of people. 1) You are striving for a career in the future that requires you to have a degree. For example, I plan to become a pilot in the near future, but nearly every big commercial company requires a bachelors degree in aeronautical science (or something similar) from an accredited university. 2) You are going there to expand on your already well established career in order to either learn more, or obtain a degree you need in order to move higher up in the chain for your company. In my opinion, if you are not apart of those two categories, then college might be really risky and I wouldn't recommend it that much. Of course it might be useful if you are going to get a stem degree, but make sure you have a solid plan after that.\\n\\nOn another note, those who say college is way too expensive to go into are not entirely true. Let me explain the situation I went through after my recent high school graduation. I planned on going to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University for my aeronautical science degree, since it was pretty famous for both its engineering and flight paths. I got accepted and even got a top not presidential scholarship of 15k. However, it was to expensive for me to get into still (total price of first years is about 45k). So I looked into my own state (Colorado) and found MSU. The campus when I went looked awesome, close to two stadiums and an amusement park in the heart of the city. Not only that, but an all access RTD (light rail, bus, basically transportation)¬†was included within the tuition. It also includes an aeronautical science course, and being within 50 miles of Denver international airport it has some pretty good reputation. Without the scholarship, 1 year is only 7k for Colorado residents...¬† Bottom line is, yes college can be VERY expensive, but it can be reasonably low cost as well. Just make sure you research well before you decide on your pick.",0,0

5jRYB3nGxmc,"‚ÄúI have a friend who's an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say look how beautiful it is, and I'll agree. Then he says I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing, and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts.‚Äù\\n\\n‚Äï Richard Feynman",3,0

5jRYB3nGxmc,"Sept. 15. After 13 years in orbit, NASA's Cassini spacecraft made a fateful plunge into Saturn's atmosphere early Friday morning, ending the mission just one month shy of its 20th launch anniversary. Earth received @Cassini-Saturn's final signal at 7:55 a.m. ET (1155 GMT). Cassini is now part of the planet it studied, Cassini's team said on Twitter Friday morning. The probe was running low on fuel, so the 13-year tour of the Saturn system mission had to end. The spacecraft made a deliberate plunge into Saturn's atmosphere to avoid the small possibility of it crashing into a potentially habitable moon, in particular Enceladus. Launched in 1997, the 3.26-billion-U.S.-dollar Cassini-Huygens mission has been touring the Saturn system since arriving there in 2004. The Huygens lander separated from Cassini and plopped down on the surface of Saturn's moon Titan shortly after the arrival.The Cassini probe had been scheduled to study the Saturn system until 2008, but the mission was given two extensions that stretched its lifetime into 2017.During its journey, Cassini has made numerous dramatic discoveries. Discoveries are available online if viewers are inclined-ly interested to know more. Have a nicely brewed hot coffee.",0,0

0501BTnbrxg,"this song has me in tears.\\nabout 2 years ago my family and I decided to convert a school bus and travel the country (im from WA). now your problly thinking, wow thats awesome. well it was awesome. it was the best experience I've ever had - but there was also some hard things that came with it.\\n1) we had to leave everything we knew behind (family, friends - Home)\\n2) there is 8 people in my family (it makes hide and seek way better ;). at the time we also had 2 dogs. so imagine, 8 people and 2 dogs in about 300 sq feet. not very much room for eight people and 2 dogs.\\nso about 2 months into our trip we decided to go to Texas and manage a vineyard (yes a vineyard, but we also had family in Texas to). the commitment was just 1 harvest season... so we where smack dead in the  middle of the country. 15 miles from the nearest town, where our family lived. now the town was VERY tiny (2 miles long to be exact). so imagine managing 7 acres in grapes with no else but our landlords, in the summer, with almost 100% humidity the whole time, we had a few trees and they weren't even by the grapes... we ended up losing 8 months worth of sweat blood and tears put into those plants because of the weather... we all got lonely. we had none of our friends from home, so you can imagine i had a few breakdowns during this time, but you know what, I had remind myself that God has a plan, he's watching out for us. then when we came back from visiting our family, NF released Therapy Session. I had memorized every song he's released (not the whole album of moments though). I was so exited... He helped me so much through when i was working on the grapes, i just put on my ear buds and worked for hours with his music on repeat.\\nafter that, we backtracked to Arizona where we stayed with some friends that had a goat farm (yes a goat farm) for about 4 months. now during this time i became their intern. so i woke up every morning at six, milk goats, feed them, do your regular farm chores. I loved it. soon enough I was birthing goats, then I was helping them give medication. my mentor Lylah  taught me so much about goats. when we birthed the second baby goat, my mentor turned to me, wet baby and all, and said: do you want her? now i was thinking like do i want to clean her off? nope, she wanted to give her to me. now that was about the best thing that ever happened to me, I named her Penny. \\nthe day before we left AZ our little dog Roxy got out and got into the goat pen where they have their guard dog... after a while we noticed she was gone. my first thought was the goat pen cause she was a curios puppy that wanted to play with the goats. I sprinted to the goat pen yelling her name. i looked at the guard dog Whinnie, and said: where is she. she pointed her nose over to where I found my little 6 pound puppy had been thrown around like a chew toy, trying to drag herself away. i scooped up my half dead puppy and started running for one of the buildings on the property screaming my older brother and my mentors name to meet me in the library. now she was in shock while was holding her so she was just sitting in my lap, both of us shaking. when my older brother and mentor came in-well first my brother came in and said o crap and went to get my mom. my mentor stayed with me and told me: Everett, that is a shit ass bite and she's probally not going to make it. now you might think: how could you say that to a 13 year old boy. but you know what, that's my mentor. she's not afraid to tell you no, she's NOT going to sugar coat it and I'm glad she didn't. it helped me embrace it.\\nwe took her to the vet and on the way she snapped out of her shock. so now I've got a screaming dog in my lap, there's blood all over me... we finally make it to the vet and they quickly get her on morphing and antibiotics. the vet came in and said: she had to have surgery that she would have a 50 50% and he said she probally would be paralized from her bottom half down if she made it. sadly we ended up having to put her down... that was a hard day. but guess what i did....... I turned on NF......... and it helped me cope with what happened. I don't know how he does it, but... I'm littlerly sitting here with tears running down my face - and i've had to restart this song about 50 times  so i can keep typing#memorizedit.\\nso we left a couple days later to go to Maine where one of my uncles live. I brought Penny with me. now at this point we sold the bus because we couldn't afford to pay for gas on our car and the bus. so we bought a trailer to tow and we converted the back of our big van into a goat pen for Penny.\\nwhen we got to maine, i bought another goat as a buddy (goats can't be alone otherwise they get depressed but she was with me then). his name is Troy. my little snuggle bug. after about 5ish months of living there we decided we needed to go home. we couldn't live like this anymore. so we packed up everything (again), Penny, Troy, everything. on our trip back I got really discouraged and lots of people didn't think a 14 year old could handle goats. well sometimes they where right. sometimes i couldn't handle it. there was so many times i wanted to just GIVE UP.... but i didn't. I listened to NF as whenever i could. \\nI had to remind myself God's got a plan, and you know what. he did. I wouldn't have EVER learned goats, or how to manage a vineyard, i learned patience, I learned so many things on my trip that i NEVER EVER have learned. And i'm home now, my goats are ok, im ok, im with my family, we're home. NF. you have been a huge part of my life and i want to thank you\\n         -Everett",1,0

3la8bsi4P-c,Triplets are amazingly powerful and energetic but I think YOU missed Snoop's point.

The fact that triplets and the trap rolling hi-hat are so overused actually takes their power away and makes them a thoughtless go-to for wannabe rappers to use because it's in.,0,0

Ayb_2qbZHm4,"College is for, how I see it,¬†two types of people. 1) You are striving for a career in the future that requires you to have a degree. For example, I plan to become a pilot in the near future, but nearly every big commercial company requires a bachelors degree in aeronautical science (or something similar) from an accredited university. 2) You are going there to expand on your already well established career in order to either learn more, or obtain a degree you need in order to move higher up in the chain for your company. In my opinion, if you are not apart of those two categories, then college might be really risky and I wouldn't recommend it that much. Of course it might be useful if you are going to get a stem degree, but make sure you have a solid plan after that.\\n\\nOn another note, those who say college is way too expensive to go into are not entirely true. Let me explain the situation I went through after my recent high school graduation. I planned on going to Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University for my aeronautical science degree, since it was pretty famous for both its engineering and flight paths. I got accepted and even got a top not presidential scholarship of 15k. However, it was to expensive for me to get into still (total price of first years is about 45k). So I looked into my own state (Colorado) and found MSU. The campus when I went looked awesome, close to two stadiums and an amusement park in the heart of the city. Not only that, but an all access RTD (light rail, bus, basically transportation)¬†was included within the tuition. It also includes an aeronautical science course, and being within 50 miles of Denver international airport it has some pretty good reputation. Without the scholarship, 1 year is only 7k for Colorado residents...¬† Bottom line is, yes college can be VERY expensive, but it can be reasonably low cost as well. Just make sure you research well before you decide on your pick.",0,0

It is extremely rare that we get twisters or funnel clouds of any kind here in Oregon, yet they're not only touching down here, they're also becoming more frequent! Just last spring a small waterspout/tornado tore through the coastal surfing town of Manzanita, and before that there was a funnel cloud that formed over Salem a few years back. This honestly terrifies me! That being said, I took a trip down to Houston a week a half ago and saw the devastation Harvey left behind, and I will say it looked like a war zone because, quite honestly, it did. Does that mean I blame the unstoppable force of mother nature?

CMfo-s9izIc,"So, _Vox_ , you've laid out the downsides of treating areas hit by Natural Disasters like War Zones. That's great.\\n\\n\\n\\nBut, surely, you want to do more than just push a narrative, or than just put yourself on a pedestal as the Ethical News Outlet while condemning all your competitors, right? If that's indeed what you want, you might want to dedicate a section on the *positive effects* of treating areas devastated by Natural Disasters like War Zones. Just to, you know, give the full picture? Of course..... it would have been better to do this in this very video, but I guess anybody can make mistakes. And I'm *sure* you would be willing to correct this oversight.\\n\\nAlso, of course, you didn't exactly provide a good alternative, which is also not a very good idea if you want to do some actual, you know.... reporting.\\n\\nAs for those possible positive effects I mentioned, here are a few ideas.\\nFor example, it *does* seem to be true that people are more willing to help other people when such mindsets are needed most, like after a large percentage of the houses in an area is destroyed by a Hurricane. Now that you mention it, I think this could actually be used to combat the alleged looter myth.\\nSpeaking of which.... it seems to me that it's not so much the covering of looting that's the problem, but the fact that there is no actual data attached to such reporting. If you compare the number of break-ins of, say, Electronic Appliances stores _[this would be a better fit than grocery stores, as that way one can better differentiate between looting and scavenging]_ in the week after the disaster to the number in the week before the disaster -- or something like that -- you can tell the people how much the problem of looting is *actually* a problem. If the number of break-ins in this category has gone up significantly, then maybe something needs to be done. But you say that shouldn't be the case. Okay then: this will show in the data. And, by *showing* that data, you can alleviate people's fears of looting in the case of future disasters.\\nThirdly, treating these areas like War Zones gives the opportunity to compare the devastation brought by these Hurricanes to what happened with previous ones. This would seem to be a much more effective way to communicate the very direct effect Man-Made Climate Change has on the personal lives of people, then comparing Wind Velocities, Rain Output, and the wingspan of a Hurricane. And isn't that, after all, the goal of reporting? To convey the message that needs to be conveyed in as effective a way as possible?\\nFinally, an example of not so much a positive, but more a non-negative. You can't really blame people for wanting to stay living where they live, even if that's in a flooding plane. You should instead blame the policies that have led to there being houses where there shouldn't be, and the lack of policies to incentivize people to move. Of course, the adage is that, in the wake of a disaster, the victims / survivors are more important than Politics -- and this is true. And people are going to show perseverance in the wake of adversity, and all that, and proclaim they will rebuild and not let these hardships keep them down. Should News Outlets simply cut those statements out, thus betraying the people who were kind enough to speak to the reporters, even though we can be sure they had more important things on their minds? The question of what period to allot to covering the direct, personal impacts of disasters, and when to transition more to the context of disasters and why they happen, is a very difficult one. Maybe you could answer that question in your next video, seeing as you act like you'd know the answers to such questions.\\n\\nI'm not saying there aren't downsides to the way Natural Disasters are portrayed by the media -- major downsides, even. What did you expect? It's the media.\\nHowever, I *am* saying I look forward to the follow-up to the video on this page. Because after being confronted with such massive oversights, there is NO WAY you won't post one, right? Right?!",0,1

He raps about life and over coming pain. He just so happens to be a Christian and that's how he coped with the pain but I wouldn't say Christian is the theme of his music.

dUOUo02v4XE,"A dark brown man covered in body hair. The first thing you notice is his smell. Curry and poo. He has a skinny frame, oily skin and hair. Slimy. Oozing curry and poo from his pores. A thin pathetic moustache. Pitiful.\\n\\nHe pulls down his pants to reveal a small penis surrounded by a mane of smelly greasy pubic hair. He turns around and I see his buttocks smiling at me. His butt is covered in more coarse hair, black. Small cheeks. He bends over and parts his cheeks. A waft of pure poo fills the air. The black hair is thickest here, with a brown hue. Dangle berries can be found. Yesterday's shit clinging on to life. The poo is a light brown, like pumpkin soup. He uses his hands to part the mattered poo hair to reveal a little brown butthole. Caked in poo. Disgusting. The epicentre of filth. An ugly crater. A dirty yet prolific anus.\\n\\nThe Indian.",1,0

JtZo62mPEKM,"To bring all these things to right perspective. Why other characters aren't in this: 1. Scott - no reason for him to appear in this, Keeping up with the KARDASHIANS? 2. Rob - insecure, doesn't want to film, he appears on KUWTK very few times 3. Caitlyn - betraying and trashing the whole family after 20+ years? Lol bish bye. I am not saying Kardashians were the nicest to her, but didn't her (Bruce back then) when she divorced Kris. 4. Kanye - he doesn't want to film his life, it's known for years, appears on KUWTK like 1-2 times per season lol 5. Kids - I mean, would you have the nerve to film this with little children?

His existence on Mount Rushmore is justified.\\n\\nThis whole notion that Europeans brought the concept of war to Native Americans is false.  Native Americans tribes were at constant war with other tribes for hundreds if not thousands of years.  We will never know how many tribes were wiped out by other tribes during these wars.  The tomahawk did not suddenly pop into existence the moment setters stepped foot on the American continent.  If it was not for the Europeans...Spanish, French, and English (all Christian) conquering the Native Americans and settling this continent (Spain/Mexico, England/US, France/Canada), the Natives would still be killing each other and would still have the same societal existence they had 250 years ago, today. \\n\\nWe were told 2,000 years ago that Christians would conquer the world and it has been fulfilled.  Now we wait to leave this hellish rebellious world via the Rapture.\\n\\nRevelation 6:1-2\\nAnd I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.\\nAnd I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.\\n\\n\\nThe white horse signifies righteousness and cleanliness through God.  The crown signifies eternal life as given to those who believe upon Jesus Christ, that He died for their sins and was risen by God the Father to Heaven with His body.  There He will sit at the right hand of the Father and rule for all eternity.  It says the men of Christ will go forth to conquer and he has, the whole world as a matter of fact.  Except for north Africa and the Middle East....both of which are 99% dessert.  Nothing to conquer.  Just by happenstance that is where the vast majority of muslims live on the planet...in desolate places.  A living God would not give his believers a desolate place to live on earth.  He would give them the richest and most abundant places to live on earth and He has.  He would also give them favor in battle and He has. Now we wait to leave.  Those of us who are left behind during the Rapture will be slaughtered by the muslims and the antichrist obama.  Our actual lives, our eternal lives await us.",0,0

o5xxIciBSME,"Some critique for your video: 1. You shouldn't use music with lyrics in it while you're speaking yourself, else it makes it super hard to follow.\\n2. Settle for a style of presentation and use of elements. One time you're using the blue bar screen to show 90% of the screen. Then you just show it with the money falling down on LG, but at first it gave the sense that you wanted to show another percentage. \\nWith style I mean art style. Your video was very inconsitent in this regard. One time you are using very simple shapes to convey your point, then 3D animations (the globe scene) then real footage (the hand holding the phone). Apart from what you're saying the only other thing to make your point are the things you show the audience, so this part has to be made and thought through very carefully. Does this type of transission between two scenes make sense in MY video or does it just look cool on it's own?

For whatever reason, Samsung phones aren't nice to have. Might have something to do with how they blow up.

Androids, no matter how much nicer they are, don't have a monopoly on millennials. \\nHowever, Samsung having a monopoly on these screens is quite funny, but Samsung should worry that if LG could ever match their production lines, they would lose their biggest client.

While he did good things for unions and the progressive movement he believed in eugenics and helped start the Tuskegee Institute.

A8QQBRIqZmw,"Roosevelt is actually credited for...quite a bit. First, he was a pioneer in conservation, and is highly responsible for the preservation of the beautiful national parks we have today. Second, he was labeled the trust-buster, and was one of the most effective presidents in cutting down on unethical big business practices. The whole thing about the monument being built on native land is really awful, unfortunately at the time of construction the disregard for natives and native tradition was really high (the Dawes Act, for example), but regardless of that, IF one were to make a monument like that, I think it's a bit silly to say it shouldn't include TDR....",0,0
A8QQBRIqZmw,"Teddy Roosevelt...the President that literally signed into existence National Parks?  Without Teddy....Yellowstone, Badlands, Black Hills and Yosemite would be mining and logging areas.  His existence on Mount Rushmore is justified.\\n\\nThis whole notion that Europeans brought the concept of war to Native Americans is false.  Native Americans tribes were at constant war with other tribes for hundreds if not thousands of years.  We will never know how many tribes were wiped out by other tribes during these wars.  The tomahawk did not suddenly pop into existence the moment setters stepped foot on the American continent.  If it was not for the Europeans...Spanish, French, and English (all Christian) conquering the Native Americans and settling this continent (Spain/Mexico, England/US, France/Canada), the Natives would still be killing each other and would still have the same societal existence they had 250 years ago, today. \\n\\nWe were told 2,000 years ago that Christians would conquer the world and it has been fulfilled.  Now we wait to leave this hellish rebellious world via the Rapture.\\n\\nRevelation 6:1-2\\nAnd I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard, as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts saying, Come and see.\\nAnd I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth conquering, and to conquer.\\n\\n\\nThe white horse signifies righteousness and cleanliness through God.  The crown signifies eternal life as given to those who believe upon Jesus Christ, that He died for their sins and was risen by God the Father to Heaven with His body.  There He will sit at the right hand of the Father and rule for all eternity.  It says the men of Christ will go forth to conquer and he has, the whole world as a matter of fact.  Except for north Africa and the Middle East....both of which are 99% dessert.  Nothing to conquer.  Just by happenstance that is where the vast majority of muslims live on the planet...in desolate places.  A living God would not give his believers a desolate place to live on earth.  He would give them the richest and most abundant places to live on earth and He has.  He would also give them favor in battle and He has. Now we wait to leave.  Those of us who are left behind during the Rapture will be slaughtered by the muslims and the antichrist obama.  Our actual lives, our eternal lives await us.",0,0

o5xxIciBSME,"This video was really good quality, damn well done!",0,0
o5xxIciBSME,"This was good, I‚Äôm glad this information is beginning to become more widely known. But while this video places all of its focus on the iPhone it ignores the fact that this relationship between Apple and Samsung goes back to the late 90s, the same time when Tim Cook joined Apple. Apple has been Samsung‚Äôs single largest customer for more than a decade. And it‚Äôs all because of components that Apple buys from Samsung.\\n\\nThis video came so close to giving a more rounded view of Apple‚Äôs relationship with Samsung! I really enjoyed it, just wish it went one or two steps further with the history.\\n\\nAlso, when the video implies that we can know with any real certainty how Tim Cook feels about this situation just comes across as immature to me. Aside from the lawsuits with Samsung over PHONE DESIGN specifically, we‚Äôve never heard Tim speak negatively about Samsung components and chip manufacturing.\\n\\nAgain, Tim Cook started this relationship between Apple and Samsung back in 1997/1998. To act as if we know how he feels about Samsung and Apple‚Äôs reliance on them is silly and unfounded.\\n\\nNow some people like to point at Apple‚Äôs growing relationship with TSMC (Taiwan Semi Conductor) for CPU manufacturing as a sign that Apple is looking to stop working with Samsung for this. But that‚Äôs seriously misguided and looking at it from just one angle, here‚Äôs the sum up of the full picture:\\n\\nWhat Apple hates is not being able to make enough iPhones. Apple produces an insane amount of iPhones everyday, relying on multiple partners to help put it all together, but with the demand of how many iPhones Apple needs to produce every quarter, they literally run into walls of what the industry is physically able to produce.\\n\\nSo yes, Apple prefers situations where they can use multiple partners for components and manufacturing so that they are not reliant on any one source. They HAVE to have multiple sources otherwise they will not be able to produce the ~200-250 million iPhones per year that they need.",0,0

Apple has been Samsung‚Äôs single largest customer for more than a decade. And it‚Äôs all because of components that Apple buys from Samsung.\\n\\nThis video came so close to giving a more rounded view of Apple‚Äôs relationship with Samsung! I really enjoyed it, just wish it went one or two steps further with the history.\\n\\nAlso, when the video implies that we can know with any real certainty how Tim Cook feels about this situation just comes across as immature to me. Aside from the lawsuits with Samsung over PHONE DESIGN specifically, we‚Äôve never heard Tim speak negatively about Samsung components and chip manufacturing.\\n\\nAgain, Tim Cook started this relationship between Apple and Samsung back in 1997/1998. To act as if we know how he feels about Samsung and Apple‚Äôs reliance on them is silly and unfounded.\\n\\nNow some people like to point at Apple‚Äôs growing relationship with TSMC (Taiwan Semi Conductor) for CPU manufacturing as a sign that Apple is looking to stop working with Samsung for this. But that‚Äôs seriously misguided and looking at it from just one angle, here‚Äôs the sum up of the full picture:\\n\\nWhat Apple hates is not being able to make enough iPhones. Apple produces an insane amount of iPhones everyday, relying on multiple partners to help put it all together, but with the demand of how many iPhones Apple needs to produce every quarter, they literally run into walls of what the industry is physically able to produce.\\n\\nSo yes, Apple prefers situations where they can use multiple partners for components and manufacturing so that they are not reliant on any one source. They HAVE to have multiple sources otherwise they will not be able to produce the ~200-250 million iPhones per year that they need.",0,0

First, the Native Americans kept raiding near-by American settlements and slaughtered so many innocent people. Second, the 'financial incentive' of the natural resources in the land made it worthwhile to engage in troop movements. It was not, in-fact, some instance of the US just going back on a deal and being brutish assholes. \\n\\n3rd. Native Americans were not just some victims, they were also aggressors.

This entire crap show is shown from only one point of view. Try making a video that is critical of North Korea while living in North Korea; I guarantee you would not live very long. But you can sleep safely in your warm beds tonight because you know that as Americans you have the right to say what you want, including baseless lies and insults against one of the defining monuments of the USA. How about showing some gratitude for the accomplishments of the men depicted on that monument? Thomas Jefferson authored the document that declared our independence from Great Britain. George Washington successfully led the Patriot Army against the world's strongest military and won, securing our independence. He then served two terms as our first President, setting an example for all future presidents to live up to. Abraham Lincoln saved the unity of this nation when it looked as if it would be torn apart forever. Theodore Roosevelt, among so many other things, came up with the idea for our national parks. (be sure to thank him the next time you go to Yellowstone or Yosemite) That is what Mount Rushmore is all about, a monument of gratitude to four giants among men who established and preserved the greatest and most free nation in history.

They are scientifically called Unicornis Rhinocerous. The other kind is called Diceros Bicornis, the two-horned ones. Unicorns were several times mentioned in the Bible but it was a mis-translation because it was really referring to the Diceros Bicornis, specifically to its two horns, the short one above and the long one below in comparison to the size difference of the descendants of Ephraim and Manasseh. Why do you think people changed its meaning?\\n Also, dragons are real. Old english dictionaries defined them as real and very rare. Even most people in old times knew that they were real. But they are all dead now and nowhere to be found, aren't they. I am talking about all those people in the old times but you can also apply it to those extinct dragons. They are now called dinosaurs, etc, as coined by Sir Richard Owens. But some of the dinosaurs featured in Hollywood and in most museums are not even real but are just artistic renditions of some museum showroom artists to boost their commercial marketability. Pop culture which is capable of repetetive broadcasting and broadpublishing brainwashed multiple generations of people into thinking that Dragons and Unicorns are not real. Biblewise, Satan was compared to a snake, a lion and a dragon.\\n Who knows? Maybe someday, in the far future, people will no longer believe in snakes and lions as well after a long time that they have been extinct, if they get extinct at all.

iA86imHKCMw,"When 13% of the population is responsible for 52% of the murders in America. Most of them black on black crime. You cannot expect police to stand by and let people get away with crime. It's their duty to protect the cities and neighborhoods they patrol. Police are at high risk, more so than ever before of not returning home to their families. If your making millions a year throwing around a GD ball How about YOU millionaires take on some responsibility for change? How many of these players protesting actually give to the schools and communities that gave them all the opportunities? How many actually volunteer and spend time giving positive speeches or lectures to youth that could help kids? Instead of bringing division and telling these kids that their victims of institutional racism, and they'll never be able to overcome it. It's all false. Blatantly false. Under this premise we could never of had a black president. Much less serve 2 terms. Athletes and entertainers of all types regardless of skin color making millions. Not even hardly oppressed. What is oppressed is their ability to think for themselves and choose not to follow the lies, and false narratives. You want to make a difference, to make things better? Start volunteering your time to neighborhoods,  and schools, and churches. Give to those you feel are oppressed and most of all TACKLE the problem of crime.",0,0

I don't even need to watch a second of this video to know how Shannon feels.\\n\\nI have no issue with players kneeling. But I sincerely hope *all* these guys are actively doing something in their own communities to improve the situation. All of them. Because honestly, raising awareness during the anthem can only do so much to help those who truly are suffering. That itself won't fix the broken system.

iA86imHKCMw,I am white male and 69 years old. I started working in my father‚Äôs service in 1958 when I was 10 years old. Was that because I am white or is it because I had a father that spent his time teaching me how to respect work and how to depend on myself and the skill he tough me. I went to school and I didn‚Äôt like school but I had a mother and a father that made me go to school and to pay attention and I knew that my mother and father would go to school during open house and talk to my teachers. I also knew that from time to time I would get a report card and my parents wanted me to give it to them and I better have good grades. I had a mother that would help me after school to learn the things we were covering in class.-Was this because I am white. No it was because I had a mother and a father that wanted me to learn so when I got older I could get and keep a job. Did pro football players take a knee because I was treated unfairly because i never learned to read or write or do math.  No they didn‚Äôt have to because I had a mother and a father that made sure I learned how to be a good citizen and to get a good job. \nNow when I went to school I had the same problems as all students do. When I was made fun of if I asked a question. There were kids that made fun of other students if they would not be in the in group. There were pressures to be cool and act up in class. But I knew that I had a mother and a father at home that would not be happy if I didn‚Äôt work to be the best I could. \nNow we have pro football players that take a knee or stay in the locker room during the Nation Anthem like that is going to help? But there is not one more parent taking the time to help the young student to do anything to prepare to go into life ready to offer their skills to an employer so they can earn a good living. To many women are razing children by their selves and don‚Äôt have the time or the ability to equip their children with the tools they need to make it into today‚Äôs world. So say it‚Äôs because they are black but that doesn‚Äôt help then at all. Because I have found that I was able to get jobs as a welder not because I am white but because I can weld. When I first started out as a welder I found out pretty quickly that if I only knew how to weld I would get laid off as soon as the welding part of the job was done. I could have said it‚Äôs because I am white. Sound pretty dumb doesn‚Äôt it. No dumber that saying it if I was black. So I reasoned that if I knew how to weld and do sheetmetal work I was more valuable and if I could do machining even better. So I learned those skill also. So every job I ever got was because I had prepared myself and made myself more valuable to employers. It had nothing to do with the color of my skin it had everything to do what I offered employers. If I were black and did the same thing I would have had the same result. I know this because I have had to compete for jobs with other people some black and have not been given the job because the black person was better equipped than I was at that time. If you want a welder the only thing I am interested in is that person can weld. I have run companies and it is always can they do the job. If not the owner wants to know why I hired them.,0,0

Are you John Oliver fanboys even aware that John doesn't even write his own material? that he doesn't actually know the first thing about politics and economics? and that he is literally nothing but a left wing Libtard mouth piece? All this goofball does is bring up problems everyone with eyes and ears already knows, tries to sneak in his political ideologies with his terrible jokes, and offer no actual viable solutions to anything.\\n\\nAlso, a lot of you idiots in this comment section are blaming conservatives or capitalism, when they literally have nothing to do with the problem. The problem is CORPORATISM. This retard John Oliver's solution to every problem that ever comes up is bigger government, less freedom for people to do what they want, and higher taxes that prevent people from progressing in their businesses. (especially small business, which john Oliver doesn't give a shit about).\\n\\nWhat is without a doubt the saddest thing about John Oliver's fan base is how clueless his fans are. This country and leftists around the world have actually gotten so bad/stupid that they actually get their news from LATE NIGHT FUCKING COMEDIANS. It must be really convenient to have a comedian tell you what your political ideologies are, instead of actually doing the reading and research.\\n\\nThe truth takes actual digging, you clueless children.

00wQYmvfhn4,"I just watched Steven Crowder's video rebuttal and he is entirely right. You don't offer any real solution and having attempted to start a small business myself in California, it is obviously too much regulation that is the problem. Small businesses don't get off the ground because they are stomped down, not by big competition, but by huge taxes and low profit margins. A huge corporation can pay lawyers $200 an hour to file all of your paperwork and renew your licenses, but some of these licenses don't even make sense. In california you need a BEAR license to work on electronics in someone's home. You don't need any education, experience, or training. You just need to buy the license. What is the purpose of that? It's pointless red tape, and if you don't have it you can be heavily fined. Not to mention their have been traps laid out for smaller business exclusively, where you can go out for a job and the police will be their checking for your license. If you have it, you still are fucked out of the job because their is no job and now you have a half hour drive back where you will make no fucking money.

ICqTZeiimpk,"PLEASE READ, Thanks to everyone for joining us on our protest to all these teams for being so unprofessional and showing such disrespect to our country, military,  first responders,  our President and to all the true American patriots.  \\nKneeling to the Anthem does nothing productive to our problems.  \\nUnfortunately people kill people,  wether it's black on black, white on white,  cops on whites or blacks, citizens targeting cops. \\nIt's only going to stop when everyone as human beings start working out our differences, forgiving  and start to come together as a strong nation. \\nThe division is only getting worse because everyone's letting it. \\nWe all bleed red and have the same needs so what's racial division going to solve? \\nDo you all realize it's going to start as a Civil war escalating into a Revolutionary war when martial laws declared then the possibility of WW3 since we are all fighting amongst ourselves.  \\nThis is what some sick as people are pushing for, don't give it to them people.\\n \\nI have to ask what has this taking a knee accomplished ever since Kaepernick started it? Nothing! It has caused more fights and more division than ever. \\nAlot of people have used this for an exuse to call even us racist or other derogatory comments when this isn't about race anymore and everyone knows it. It's an excuse to be hateful to one another. \\n\\nHow about instead of name calling and taking a knee since the cause was suppose to be about police wrongfully profiling black people, us as a nation and adults call for a U.S. wide meeting in every state inviting officers and community members to actuall discuss the issues and come up with a solution!\\nOne Nation under God  God bless America and God bless all of us,.we need it! üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏",33,4

Trump reminds the athletes and people protesting that the military service has protected us and have gave us the opportunity to live in the this country we call the United States of America.

The companies become dependent on the federal government to stay in business rather than providing better service at lower costs to the consumer.\\n- But don't mind me, economics is much too complicated to be understood by simple serfs at the bottom.\\nYou should probably rely on the uniform opinions of late night political commentators and mainstream media pundits who read propaganda off of a teleprompter for a company owned by those big businesses that lobby the government for more taxpayer subsidies and more regulations that will further eliminate the competition and solidify their monopolies.\\nAnd definitely don't pay any attention to the fact that those corporations are all run by Democratic Party donors and campaign affiliates.\\nOnly a immoral rightwing white supremacist neo-nazi would see a problem with the radical left's control of the major corporations, the majority of lobbyists, the news media, late night commentary, sports media, Hollywood, entertainment and academia from the public (k-12) school system to the Universities... I mean, it shouldn't concern anyone that such a small group of people with the same ideology and hegemonic control over the public dialogue are all pushing people to voluntarily give the federal government more control over every industry in America.\\nBesides, we all know that the U.S. Government can't be corrupted. Especially if the Democrats are running it, right?\\nDemocrats have done nothing but help people.\\nThey've run Detroit for decades and there's virtually no unemployment, poverty and no crime. Plus, without those greedy, racist Republicans, there are no black Americans struggling in Detroit.\\nChicago? Same story. It is basically a utopia...a safe haven for all of the oppressed, and virtually no problems.\\nThe Democrats never seem to get richer while the people under them get poorer, right? Income inequality?

General Mills\\n6. Danone\\n7. Asociated British Foods plc\\n8. Kellogg's\\n9. Mondel√©z\\n10. Mars\\n And we are not even mentioning the  gigantic pharmaceutical display of power other companies like Johnson and Johnson's have.\\n Take a much smaller company like Microsoft for instance, which (also in 2016) bought linkedin for $26 billion dollars only a few days after Reid Hoffman (one of the paypal mafia godfathers) assisted the bilderberg meeting of 2016!! \\nImpressive game theory to say the least.\\n\\nThere's also a UN and WEF agenda that even governments are following to be fully met by 2030. Goal17 from the global goals for sustainable development, for instance, talks about partnerships, not just between companies, but also for the unification of governments and 5 main dominating country leaders, not just the US or the petrodollar anymore. I would encourage you to read an article published by a danish minister titled: Welcome to 2030, I own nothing, have no privacy and life has never been better. Also check out the foreshadowing tv shows like Black Mirror and Mr Robot are presenting with a little help from agencies like the FBI in the case of Mr. Robot from HBO for example. This is no joke. Check out the official documents being published by companies, ONGs and government portals. Check out the city planning brochures from visa and mastercard where they talk about banning cash, getting everyone on bikes as well as getting everyone to use NFC chips from the comfort of your smartphone, your smart watch, your smart glasses and even your smart contact lens. Also be sure to check the futuristic promotional videos that companies like honda, samsung and others are presenting and rolling out. Last but not least, look at the trending topics also being introduced to the public at influential platforms such as Ted talks. It really is quite terrifying to grasp the pace at which it's all unravelling before our very eyes. Should I mention the 5 most influential and yet so secretive families of the 20th century? Let's start with the two Pharaohs (Ro) get it? Look it up! Rothschilds ( Red Shield, Red Cross, Red Army) think the British flag wait is it the Swiss?, they probably manage the Vatican's bank for all we know, how about the Rockefellers? BP, Exxomobil, Royal Dutch Shell, the petrodollar baby! Founders of the bilderberg group, Council of Foreign relations, Trilateral comission, United Nations, investors of London Business School, Harvard, Stanford, David Rockefeller was the creator and innovator of many international structures, think tanks and governmental behind-the-scenes organizations.

Airlines make on average around $4 per person profit, yes $4 most of their revenue comes from charging for luggage etc, the stuff we (as customers) don't like. This is due to an endless taxation circle that makes it harder for smaller companies to thrive while larger companies that should have failed, get bailouts from the government. All 4 of those airlines have received bailouts. Government intervention and calling for more regulation will do nothing but ignite an already burning problem. Get rid of the mass taxation that Obama brought in and this will allow smaller business to compete with the growing monopoly. Business competition and a free market is healthy, government intervention and bailouts are not. It is your tax dollars at the end of the day that helps the banks the airlines the companies that should have gone bankrupt to keep bailing out their debt. This is why there has been a steady decrease in small business since the 70's. \\n\\nAsk ''why'', do not call for more legislation.",0,0

ZymSrDfLhW8,"I always enjoy Bois's work, and I mostly agree that unions are a good thing. But presuming that the only money an NFL player can make in his life is from his playing career seems like a huge example of cherrypicking. If you make 200,000 dollars in 4 years, you've got more financial mobility than 99% of the human race. I'm sorry, but I just can't feel sorry for you the same way I do for a factory worker making 7.50 an hour.

iA86imHKCMw,sharpe says how dare you tell us what to do as to how the owners felt about trump advising them to fire the protesters.

iA86imHKCMw,I guess the NFL may figure it out when the people stop going to their games. They should be standing like all proud Americans because they want to so sad their pocket books have to be hit to make them stand. They can certainly use a pay cut anyway. Way over paid to play a sport.,1,0

iA86imHKCMw,"Skip completely missed the point Shannon was making. With the knee protest starting from bringing attention to the lack of ¬†justice and inequities facing people of color to now becoming about unity, the original message of American inequalities is again being cast to the background.

ZymSrDfLhW8,"You do realize these strikes are inherently capitalist, right?  The idea of entertainers demanding to be paid hundreds of thousands/millions of dollars while industrial laborers make a penance is hardly what Marx had in mind.  In orthodox Marxism, you are supposed to be given assistance in accordance with your need (at least until the withering away of the state) and the value of a good/service is determined by the amount of labor required to produce it.  So, why should someone who only has to exert maximum effort one day a week, solely to provide entertainment, deserve more money than someone working multiple full-time jobs that actually produce a tangible and necessary good/service (i.e. food)?  Only capitalism can justify this - the NFL players generate more capital, because the perceived value of their labor and what it provides is worth more to people, and therefore they deserve a higher wage.\\n\\nThings like this are a sad testament to the fact that, while early Marxists at least did have an interest in the well-being of the working class, most modern Marxists are effete Ivory Tower intellectuals.  These communist-chic debutantes are so enwrapped in the capitalist way of thinking that they are unable to escape it even when ostensibly offering criticism and are only vaguely versed in the actual ideology of Marxism.  Not unlike when you see someone buying a Che Guevara shirt on a credit card at Urban Outfitters.",1,1

ZymSrDfLhW8,"1:52 yup, it's definitely not because I'm opposed to the violence and collateral damage that tend to accompany strikes...\\n\\nI really do enjoy this series, and this is an interesting story, but it's ironic that you open an intentionally-timed episode on unity with such an absolutely false divisive statement.",4,2

ZymSrDfLhW8,"Some might say that if there were at least two pro football teams, there would be no need for a strike because the other team would have swooped in and offered the players what they wanted, some might say that monopolies are bad for the workers...",0,0
ZymSrDfLhW8,"9:10 That screeching eerie sound effect on any Jon Bois video is like a shot of heroin, Pretty Good",1,1
ZymSrDfLhW8,"You do realize these strikes are inherently capitalist, right?  The idea of entertainers demanding to be paid hundreds of thousands/millions of dollars while industrial laborers make a penance is hardly what Marx had in mind.  In orthodox Marxism, you are supposed to be given assistance in accordance with your need (at least until the withering away of the state) and the value of a good/service is determined by the amount of labor required to produce it.  So, why should someone who only has to exert maximum effort one day a week, solely to provide entertainment, deserve more money than someone working multiple full-time jobs that actually produce a tangible and necessary good/service (i.e. food)?  Only capitalism can justify this - the NFL players generate more capital, because the perceived value of their labor and what it provides is worth more to people, and therefore they deserve a higher wage.\\n\\nThings like this are a sad testament to the fact that, while early Marxists at least did have an interest in the well-being of the working class, most modern Marxists are effete Ivory Tower intellectuals.  These communist-chic debutantes are so enwrapped in the capitalist way of thinking that they are unable to escape it even when ostensibly offering criticism and are only vaguely versed in the actual ideology of Marxism.  Not unlike when you see someone buying a Che Guevara shirt on a credit card at Urban Outfitters.",1,1

ZymSrDfLhW8,"I always enjoy Bois's work, and I mostly agree that unions are a good thing. But presuming that the only money an NFL player can make in his life is from his playing career seems like a huge example of cherrypicking. If you make 200,000 dollars in 4 years, you've got more financial mobility than 99% of the human race. I'm sorry, but I just can't feel sorry for you the same way I do for a factory worker making 7.50 an hour. You chose a dangerous profession, yes, but so did that factory worker, and he won't be 800k richer in 4 years at that factory. The situations are not the same.",2,3

ZymSrDfLhW8,"I always enjoy Bois's work, and I mostly agree that unions are a good thing. But presuming that the only money an NFL player can make in his life is from his playing career seems like a huge example of cherrypicking. If you make 200,000 dollars in 4 years, you've got more financial mobility than 99% of the human race. I'm sorry, but I just can't feel sorry for you the same way I do for a factory worker making 7.50 an hour. You chose a dangerous profession, yes, but so did that factory worker, and he won't be 800k richer in 4 years at that factory. The situations are not the same.",2,3
ZymSrDfLhW8,"You do realize these strikes are inherently capitalist, right?  The idea of entertainers demanding to be paid hundreds of thousands/millions of dollars while industrial laborers make a penance is hardly what Marx had in mind.  In orthodox Marxism, you are supposed to be given assistance in accordance with your need (at least until the withering away of the state) and the value of a good/service is determined by the amount of labor required to produce it.  So, why should someone who only has to exert maximum effort one day a week, solely to provide entertainment, deserve more money than someone working multiple full-time jobs that actually produce a tangible and necessary good/service (i.e. food)?  Only capitalism can justify this - the NFL players generate more capital, because the perceived value of their labor and what it provides is worth more to people, and therefore they deserve a higher wage.\\n\\nThings like this are a sad testament to the fact that, while early Marxists at least did have an interest in the well-being of the working class, most modern Marxists are effete Ivory Tower intellectuals.  These communist-chic debutantes are so enwrapped in the capitalist way of thinking that they are unable to escape it even when ostensibly offering criticism and are only vaguely versed in the actual ideology of Marxism.  Not unlike when you see someone buying a Che Guevara shirt on a credit card at Urban Outfitters.",1,1

FN5n87Gj0LM,"I guess this is the best analysis as to why we get hooked to Black Mirror in a way that is not even close to  the others. After every episode, we can't really figure out what emotion we feel and that is what makes it memorable.",4,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,The twistedness(if that's a word) of each episode also add a lot to the show. Some technological possibility that is advertised to us as a positive change may as well turn out as a complete failure.\np.s. make an episode about Rick and Morty plsss\np.p.s. thank you for your show!,0,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,"I don't know how you can say this show isn't interested in morals. Almost every episode teaches us about the pitfalls of humanity, the dangers of technology, and the consequences and sorrow that come from indulging in the negative aspects of ourselves. It's an unflinching examination of all the darkest parts of ourselves that isn't afraid to shove it in our faces. That's what I believe is the main appeal of the show for people, and for most, it's a sub conscious appeal.",0,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,I used to love gruesome tales for grime some kids when I was younger I feel that black mirror is just the adult version.,0,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,You a should have include spoiler alerts,0,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,it's because it's redpilled(cringey term sorry) about human nature and pessimistic yet ironic and therefore humorous. the show could have been a lot bleaker by offering no respite through irony,0,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,i see typos a lot in your videos. Is it because your channel is a one-man thing or it's an inside joke I missed because I wasnt here long before?,0,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,From watching this video I have no idea why somebody would watch this shit,0,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,"One thing that also makes it so disturbing, at least to me, is that the scenarios that happen are so plausible. It's the tech and trends we have today taken only a few steps further, in a bad direction. So it feels very eerie because it might actually happen.",0,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,"I think this is the first time that I do not agree with most of the arguments of a video in this channel. In addition to the extensive presentation of the concept of catharsis in Aristotle that in the end does not fit with what Blackmirror is, I think the analysis does not hit the point.\\n\\nBlackmirror is a tragedy at the precise point where it is a cultural event in which people, via a mythic / fictional narrative, are presented to the pure dilemmas of ordinary life.\\n\\nHere where Aristotle missed, the video also misses. The tragedy does not aim at any moral or intellectual catharsis. Tragedy is a cultural event that when give to see  a fiction, gives to see culture itself, ie a black mirror.\\n\\nNow, about the reason people see the show is precisely because it's a more real reality show. Television with the concept of reality show can only come to a nutty satire of reality, it is in the mythology of a tragedy that we come to the real. In other words, it is by the fiction itself that we have reached the maximum of reality - Blackmirror is that. (sorry 4 bad english)",0,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,When the hell is season 4 coming out I can't wait much longer!!!,0,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,"I don't like Black Mirror so I don't watch it.\\nIt's interesting, smartly done,¬†and I agree with your description of why it's unique. However, I don't enjoy novelty for its own sake. I personally don't find anything enjoyable in watching Black Mirror. It's novel for a fictional show, sure, but tragedies in real life are often the exact same way (tragedy without reason, catharsis, or closure), so I don't get anything more out of the show than I get from empathizing with real stories of tragedy we hear about every day.",0,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,I need to finish the most recent season still. I was two episodes away and loving it and now this has basically incentivized me to do so.,0,0

FN5n87Gj0LM,"For me, I actually can't stand this show because of these very reasons. I'm huge Twilight Zone fan, and everything in this show comes off as lazy writing in comparison. We need a moral; we need a point. I don't see how anyone can call it genius- it's lazy, and unremarkable. My two cents.",0,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,"I don't watch Black Mirror anymore because it is so depressing and dark.  I don't need that in my life.  I watched the first three seasons, waiting for an episode where there's a happy ending (or at least one that wasn't really tragic) but it never came so, I'm done.  Good riddance.",0,0

FN5n87Gj0LM,"No wtf I watch Black Mirror for it's look into another universe similar to ours where we can see what might happen if technology goes that way.      Never do I watch to pity ppl or for the fear or tragedies, smart writers.   It's basically technology twilight zone but more realistic.",0,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,It is sad that you have to endorse these products. I'm sure you hate doing it. Hopefully you'll earn enough money on Patreon & stuff so you can drop their endorsed as***.,0,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,Good essay. Like it. Nice add too.,0,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,Why do you need to show game of thrones footage so long for an analysis video of black mirror? I didn't get any deep dived depth of reasoned analysis what you generally do in other video. I watch black mirror became of the powerful imagination the show can evoke be it in a form of tragedy or something else. It points out to the society that yes we are gonna get those high tech stuff but society are you gonna retain your morality ? Are you still be a society or everything reflected upon you will be totally dark ie black ?,0,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,"faking Interestingly, I watched some of Black Mirror and found the insight into technology gone wrong interesting, but ultimately, after a few episodes, felt simply disgusted and unfulfilled.",0,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,"People keep watching because unconsciously they believe there IS a meaning and moral. They're sure (unconsciously) that after enduring all the tragedy and sadness, they'll eventually understand something pertinent. The promise of closure and insight is built into the way humans approach stories, we expect it. And the more we endure, the more important we expect the payoff to be. Black Mirror is essentially tragedy-porn.\\n\\nKind of the same reason people kept putting up with LOST's bullshit. And why people felt betrayed when the payoff was dumb/not worth it. Maybe if people get used the betrayal of a pointless exercise in bad feelings, they'll just consume without expecting a payoff? They'll just concern themselves with how pretty it is. Maybe the interesting, shocking visuals are the payoff.",0,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,Fuck dude. Why do you keep blowing my mind?,0,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,"The only problem with Black Mirror is the first episode, its not a bad episode by any means but turns people off to the show because it is far more outlandish that many of the other better written episodes. I always tell people to skip the first episode and come back to it later when they understand the show better. Episode 2 should have been the first episode.",0,0

FN5n87Gj0LM,"Stopped watching black mirror as I stopped to see any point in the show. First I thought it was commentary on technology or the human condtion/frailty, but as you said, it really isn't. It's just a punch in the stomach every time. I don't particularly like being punched, especially when I can't hit back. So if a show has no redeeming qualities for hurt it inflicts on me as the viewer, it's not worth watching imo. Also stopped watching the walking dead for the same reason (and for its repetitiveness).",0,0

FN5n87Gj0LM,"yea ultimately I like it, but I feel like it reflects the same sort of shortcutting that's already missing in lots of modern media... its a type of thing that can stand on its own but could easily become oversaturated like chuck pahlaniuk's writing style or another series is hellgirl... it seems a lot more what the people want than really what they need",0,0

9eea7_7OBZQ,"this is just my opinion about this matter. why blaming her about someones else's crime??? and why are we so shocked about mass shooting here and there??? we are all aware that every legal immigrants and citizen of this country can bare firearms. therefore, we already knew that there is a risk of this kind of criminal acts. When we are ok about every individual in this country to have a license to carry firearms. then this kind of events shouldn't shock us or for whatsoever reasons. Because we are ok for every individual to carry a gun. It is not hard for any individual to get a license to carry a gun. so chances are those crazy people who have criminal minds are susceptible from committing this kind of crimes.... Why all of a sudden you are all shocked about it.... asked the government why any kind of people can just easily get a license to carry a gun... why people can collect different high-end weapons and firearms.... when a person is suffering from anxiety, insanity, and depression these people have a questionable capabilities on their decision making. that is when people go crazy and use their 2nd amendment of rights to commit a crime.... ask yourself, what is important to you???

FN5n87Gj0LM,"I would argue that the genius of Black Mirror is that it rips away humanity's power over itself, depriving us of the comforting lies we tell ourselves that it will all work out in the end regardless of how we choose to live, even despite our best efforts. It's draw comes from the deep gravity this truth has over us despite what we want to believe. This show is self-flagellation, despite our progress and best efforts of intellect and modernity, our humanity, when indulged, is our downfall.",0,0

FN5n87Gj0LM,Absolute rubbish.  It's dark because of the main writer.  If you had watched him on British television before black mirror you would have seen his probing look into insights to eveyday subjects.

FN5n87Gj0LM,"I think that black mirror is dark because the mirror isn't reflecting light, it's absorbing it. But it does depend on the type of black they use.

FN5n87Gj0LM,"The independent episode approach to Black Mirror didn't allow for any serious attachment or care for characters in themselves for me,  so your analysis of the series through the lens of Aristotelian tragedy doesn't resonate.

So the absence of catharsis was hardly a problem because it made the premise that much clearer.",0,0

FN5n87Gj0LM,"In many ways, its actually substantively closer to greek tragedy, in the way the later plays reflect the place of human endeavour in the face of a capricious god. In that way, it completes the causality of a lot of Greek tragedy (see: oedipus, the orestaia, and most works by Euripides), with out the clearfully defined resolution of the moral chorus, a framing device both in the twilight Zone and in early tragedy.

FN5n87Gj0LM,"To me it seems that Black Mirror is all flash with no substance. The writers are very good at coming up with imaginative scenarios around technology and it's possibilities, but they all boil down to the same overused trope. It's lacking in the nuances and details that make a really exceptional show. I really think the draw of the show is less that it's genius, and more that it is avante garde. \\n\\nBasically, the draw of black mirror is the same as under age drinking.

FN5n87Gj0LM,"Black Mirror is not a tragedy, unless not getting what you want is tragic. It is about the darkest implications of technology, the limitations of using technology as a substitute for reality. Comparing it to Game of Thrones is just odd. Black Mirror is not about tragedy so much as it's about trying to overcome loss and the limitations, shortcomings and consequences. A better comparison would be that it's about the future after the downside has been revealed: Facebook, not when it was hey! I can stay in touch with all my friends, but Facebook with algorithms for advertising to antisemites, it's use by Russian intelligence to undermine American democracy. If I had to write a Black Mirror episode that was five minutes long: Someone finds the perfect mate using an advanced online dating app, they meet, everything is amazing, except one person likes Grand Theft Auto, the other person asks on the way to dinner, 'Can you wait while I run into the bank? then robs it, starts a shoot out and as police close in hops back into the car.",0,0

FN5n87Gj0LM,"Black Mirror seems to me like a good example of cyberpunk, with the emphases on advancing technology and the resulting dystopian elements, especially in regards to economic class. However, I think the more plausible sub-genre of science fiction is a sub-genre known as post-cyberpunk, in which the sheer number of issues stay the same; some problems are solved with technology while new ones arise. This, I believe, is what we've seen with past advances in technology. For example, the development of antibiotics was a profound achievement in medicine, but it is also because of those antibiotics that we now worry about antibiotic-resistant bacteria. I did recall that the various iterations of Ghost in the Shell are an example of post-cyberpunk, especially the Stand-Alone Complex series. I think the sub-genre of post-cyberpunk has a lot of potential, perhaps even involving stories analogous to other sub-genres. Imagine, for example, a space opera, except instead of being set in space, it's set in a vast sea in the distant future, where the design elements of the sea-borne vessels and the marine life can often overlap...",0,0

FN5n87Gj0LM,"Spoiler alert for the following: Season 3 Episode 1,3,&5, Season 1 Episode 3 of Black Mirror as well as Oedipus.  Hopefully you‚Äôve read it by now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI don‚Äôt think anyone is actually going to read this but if you would like an opposing viewpoint to this article, please continue. I‚Äôll try to keep it brief, this is a youtube comment after all.\\n\\nSo I feel like you‚Äôre slightly off on your point. When you talk about Catharsis around the 1:10 mark you say that Black Mirror only has Catharsis when the characters in the story experience relief which happens in season 3 episode one and season 3 episode 6. If you look back at Oedipus for example you actually don‚Äôt have that experience, when Oedipus experiences his anagnorisis he has blinded himself and is banished from Thebes. My point is, to evoke Catharsis you don‚Äôt need a moment of relief or a happy ending, you need peripeteia where the protagonist‚Äôs fortune changes from good to bad and an anagnorisis where the protagonist has a shift from ignorance to knowledge, which Black Mirror has, for example the ending of ‚ÄúShut up and Dance‚Äù when Kenny is caught by the police.\\n\\nAlso just to throw my hat into the ring about the meaning of Catharsis. If you take a look at Greek society when they embrace the idea of ideal forms. This part of Greek society did not believe in an afterlife so they believed the only way to achieve immortality was through being remembered which typically meant through wars. The idea of Catharsis was to purge emotions such as pity and fear from the audience so that they were not seen as weak and could become ideal men. \\n\\nAll of this being said I would assert that Black Mirror has a closer resemblance to the roman playwright Seneca as opposed to Aristotle. The first big difference between Seneca and Aristotle was that Seneca allowed violence to be displayed on stage. For example in his version of Oedipus when Jocasta realizes what has happened she rushes to the front of the stage, cuts open her uterus and bleeds out on stage as opposed to Aristotle having her hung off stage. As we have seen in several episodes throughout the series, they are not afraid of horrific displays of violence on screen, they even make reference to this in ‚ÄúMen Against Fire.‚Äù Seneca‚Äôs plays would also have moral harangue which is similar to season 3 episode 6 of Black Mirror where Bing gets his own show at the end of the episode where verbally assaults his audience about how they participate in the society they are all in. Also on an unrelated note, Seneca had a fascination with the super natural, much like Black Mirror's fascination with technological dystopias.",0,0

Sometimes it's that morbid curiosity we all have. Something I believe should be controlled.

UXdbCReBTR8,"Time is running out..... Jesus Christ will return soon for His bride (church) 1 Thess. 4:13-18 (by catching up in the clouds). WAKE UP & accept forgiveness of your sins through Jesus' agonizing death on the cross. He paid the price of our sins freely out of His deep LOVE for us. Man has turned from our Lord God in blatant disobedience calling evil good and good evil & we are under His judgment. He is a loving Father, but also a righteous Judge. REPENT before it's too late. You do not want to be left behind. Cry out to Jesus today & ask Him to be Lord over your life then turn from sin. If left behind you can still accept Jesus as your Savior, but you'll endure the wrath of God & Satan during the Great Tribulation which will be unfathomable. Be also forewarned to NOT take the mark of the beast (perhaps the RFID chip or bar code in righthand or forehead required to buy or sell), for those who do cannot be saved. The Lord God gave us free will so the choice is ours, but let those who have ears hear. May the Lord establish His Word Reference: (John 5:24-30;  Eph. 2:1-10,I Thes.4:9-5:11, Zech. 2:8-9, Rev.3:22, Rev. 7:9-17)  I recommend YouTube channel & website informedchristians for info on Biblical signs of Jesus' return, Christian living,  etc.",0,0

UXdbCReBTR8,"Want to know for sure that you are going to Heaven when you die? (and everyone dies)  \\n\\nJesus is the Son of the Living GOD.  The only true GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth and there can only be ONE God that actually created everything, not many... \\n\\nJesus Died, was Buried and Rose from the dead on the third day, proving He is GOD.\\n\\nJesus said in John 14:6; Jesus said to him, ‚ÄúI am The Way, The Truth, and The Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.‚Äù  NKJV\\n\\nActs 4:12 states; Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name [Jesus] under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.  NKJV\\n\\nJesus said in John 3:16-17; For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world (YOU) that He even gave His One and only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him as Savior shall not perish, but have eternal life.  For God did not send the Son into the world to judge and condemn the world, that is, to initiate the final judgment of the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.  AMP\\n\\nJesus said in John 3:3; I assure you and most solemnly say to you, unless a person is Born Again, reborn from above, spiritually transformed, renewed, sanctified, he cannot ever see and experience the kingdom of God.  AMP\\n\\nRomans 10:9-11 states; that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, ‚ÄúWhoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.  NKJV\\n\\nRomans 10:13 states; For ‚Äúwhoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.‚Äù  NKJV\\n\\n1 Corinthians 15:1-5 states; Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you‚Äîunless you believed in vain.  3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ Died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was Buried, and that He Rose Again the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.  NKJV\\n\\nAnd REPENT...\\n\\nActs 17:30 Therefore God overlooked and disregarded the former ages of ignorance; but now He commands all people everywhere to REPENT [that is, to change their old way of thinking, to regret their past sins, and to seek God‚Äôs purpose for their lives].  AMP\\n\\nJesus said in Mark 1:15 ‚ÄúThe [appointed period of] time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; REPENT [change your inner self‚Äîyour old way of thinking, regret past sins, live your life in a way that proves REPENTANCE; seek God‚Äôs purpose for your life] and believe [with a deep, abiding trust] in the good news [regarding salvation].‚Äù  AMP\\n\\n1 John 3:10 In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.  NKJV\\n\\nFrom what I have read we know how 8 of Jesus' disciples died and all 8 of those 8 chose death rather than to simply state that Jesus had not actually rose from the dead, that they were just lying, we made it all up.  Think about that!  Would you ever choose to be murdered to maintain a complete LIE?  No you would not.  You would say ‚Äúok, ok, it was a lie‚Äù.  They would not deny their Lord to keep this life because they knew they have eternal life in Jesus because they saw Him raised from the dead.\\n\\nPlease get in a quiet and alone place SOON and pray to Jesus that He show you somehow if these things above are true.  If you are sincere, He will answer you‚Ä¶\\n\\nAnd don‚Äôt ever forget just as there is a GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth there is also a devil, a Satan that hates God and everything God as ever made and that means he Hates YOU and wants to deceive and trick you into believing ANYTHING except Jesus and His salvation through the cross.  Though we should never fear for God is in complete control even when we have to walk through pain in this life for a season and the devil will soon be forever in his torment and punishment.\\n\\nSome great scriptures to look up and read below:\\n\\n1 Corinthians 6:9-11\\n1 Corinthians 15:1-4\\n1 John 3:7-15\\nMicah 6:8\\nActs 17:3\\nActs 18:5\\nJohn 4:25-26\\nMark 14:61-62\\nRevelation chapters 20-22\\nThe entire New Testament",0,0

A better comparison would be that it's about the future after the downside has been revealed: Facebook, not when it was hey! I can stay in touch with all my friends, but Facebook with algorithms for advertising to antisemites, it's use by Russian intelligence to undermine American democracy. If I had to write a Black Mirror episode that was five minutes long: Someone finds the perfect mate using an advanced online dating app, they meet, everything is amazing, except one person likes Grand Theft Auto, the other person asks on the way to dinner, 'Can you wait while I run into the bank? then robs it, starts a shoot out and as police close in hops back into the car.",0,0

FN5n87Gj0LM,"Black Mirror seems to me like a good example of cyberpunk, with the emphases on advancing technology and the resulting dystopian elements, especially in regards to economic class. However, I think the more plausible sub-genre of science fiction is a sub-genre known as post-cyberpunk, in which the sheer number of issues stay the same; some problems are solved with technology while new ones arise. This, I believe, is what we've seen with past advances in technology. For example, the development of antibiotics was a profound achievement in medicine, but it is also because of those antibiotics that we now worry about antibiotic-resistant bacteria. I did recall that the various iterations of Ghost in the Shell are an example of post-cyberpunk, especially the Stand-Alone Complex series. I think the sub-genre of post-cyberpunk has a lot of potential, perhaps even involving stories analogous to other sub-genres. Imagine, for example, a space opera, except instead of being set in space, it's set in a vast sea in the distant future, where the design elements of the sea-borne vessels and the marine life can often overlap...",0,0

FN5n87Gj0LM,"Spoiler alert for the following: Season 3 Episode 1,3,&5, Season 1 Episode 3 of Black Mirror as well as Oedipus.  Hopefully you‚Äôve read it by now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI don‚Äôt think anyone is actually going to read this but if you would like an opposing viewpoint to this article, please continue. I‚Äôll try to keep it brief, this is a youtube comment after all.\\n\\nSo I feel like you‚Äôre slightly off on your point. When you talk about Catharsis around the 1:10 mark you say that Black Mirror only has Catharsis when the characters in the story experience relief which happens in season 3 episode one and season 3 episode 6. If you look back at Oedipus for example you actually don‚Äôt have that experience, when Oedipus experiences his anagnorisis he has blinded himself and is banished from Thebes. My point is, to evoke Catharsis you don‚Äôt need a moment of relief or a happy ending, you need peripeteia where the protagonist‚Äôs fortune changes from good to bad and an anagnorisis where the protagonist has a shift from ignorance to knowledge, which Black Mirror has, for example the ending of ‚ÄúShut up and Dance‚Äù when Kenny is caught by the police.\\n\\nAlso just to throw my hat into the ring about the meaning of Catharsis. If you take a look at Greek society when they embrace the idea of ideal forms. This part of Greek society did not believe in an afterlife so they believed the only way to achieve immortality was through being remembered which typically meant through wars. The idea of Catharsis was to purge emotions such as pity and fear from the audience so that they were not seen as weak and could become ideal men. \\n\\nAll of this being said I would assert that Black Mirror has a closer resemblance to the roman playwright Seneca as opposed to Aristotle. The first big difference between Seneca and Aristotle was that Seneca allowed violence to be displayed on stage. For example in his version of Oedipus when Jocasta realizes what has happened she rushes to the front of the stage, cuts open her uterus and bleeds out on stage as opposed to Aristotle having her hung off stage. As we have seen in several episodes throughout the series, they are not afraid of horrific displays of violence on screen, they even make reference to this in ‚ÄúMen Against Fire.‚Äù Seneca‚Äôs plays would also have moral harangue which is similar to season 3 episode 6 of Black Mirror where Bing gets his own show at the end of the episode where verbally assaults his audience about how they participate in the society they are all in. Also on an unrelated note, Seneca had a fascination with the super natural, much like Black Mirror's fascination with technological dystopias.",0,0

Sometimes it's that morbid curiosity we all have. Something I believe should be controlled.

It's a philosophically stimulating show, and that makes it an enjoyable show. There are very few like it, the original Star Trek being slightly similar although a lot more optimistic.",0,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,"I do view it because of the morality of it all, though. It's a slice of life, and let's me see how the ethics of all the characters interact. I get to think of who was the most right or the least wrong. It's like Aesop's Fables, to a degree, only with a more general focus.",0,0

UXdbCReBTR8,"video was too long. Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich. But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. Plz sub",0,0

A better comparison would be that it's about the future after the downside has been revealed: Facebook, not when it was hey! I can stay in touch with all my friends, but Facebook with algorithms for advertising to antisemites, it's use by Russian intelligence to undermine American democracy. If I had to write a Black Mirror episode that was five minutes long: Someone finds the perfect mate using an advanced online dating app, they meet, everything is amazing, except one person likes Grand Theft Auto, the other person asks on the way to dinner, 'Can you wait while I run into the bank? then robs it, starts a shoot out and as police close in hops back into the car.",0,0

FN5n87Gj0LM,"Black Mirror seems to me like a good example of cyberpunk, with the emphases on advancing technology and the resulting dystopian elements, especially in regards to economic class. However, I think the more plausible sub-genre of science fiction is a sub-genre known as post-cyberpunk, in which the sheer number of issues stay the same; some problems are solved with technology while new ones arise. This, I believe, is what we've seen with past advances in technology. For example, the development of antibiotics was a profound achievement in medicine, but it is also because of those antibiotics that we now worry about antibiotic-resistant bacteria. I did recall that the various iterations of Ghost in the Shell are an example of post-cyberpunk, especially the Stand-Alone Complex series. I think the sub-genre of post-cyberpunk has a lot of potential, perhaps even involving stories analogous to other sub-genres. Imagine, for example, a space opera, except instead of being set in space, it's set in a vast sea in the distant future, where the design elements of the sea-borne vessels and the marine life can often overlap...",0,0

FN5n87Gj0LM,"Spoiler alert for the following: Season 3 Episode 1,3,&5, Season 1 Episode 3 of Black Mirror as well as Oedipus.  Hopefully you‚Äôve read it by now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI don‚Äôt think anyone is actually going to read this but if you would like an opposing viewpoint to this article, please continue. I‚Äôll try to keep it brief, this is a youtube comment after all.\\n\\nSo I feel like you‚Äôre slightly off on your point. When you talk about Catharsis around the 1:10 mark you say that Black Mirror only has Catharsis when the characters in the story experience relief which happens in season 3 episode one and season 3 episode 6. If you look back at Oedipus for example you actually don‚Äôt have that experience, when Oedipus experiences his anagnorisis he has blinded himself and is banished from Thebes. My point is, to evoke Catharsis you don‚Äôt need a moment of relief or a happy ending, you need peripeteia where the protagonist‚Äôs fortune changes from good to bad and an anagnorisis where the protagonist has a shift from ignorance to knowledge, which Black Mirror has, for example the ending of ‚ÄúShut up and Dance‚Äù when Kenny is caught by the police.\\n\\nAlso just to throw my hat into the ring about the meaning of Catharsis. If you take a look at Greek society when they embrace the idea of ideal forms. This part of Greek society did not believe in an afterlife so they believed the only way to achieve immortality was through being remembered which typically meant through wars. The idea of Catharsis was to purge emotions such as pity and fear from the audience so that they were not seen as weak and could become ideal men. \\n\\nAll of this being said I would assert that Black Mirror has a closer resemblance to the roman playwright Seneca as opposed to Aristotle. The first big difference between Seneca and Aristotle was that Seneca allowed violence to be displayed on stage. For example in his version of Oedipus when Jocasta realizes what has happened she rushes to the front of the stage, cuts open her uterus and bleeds out on stage as opposed to Aristotle having her hung off stage. As we have seen in several episodes throughout the series, they are not afraid of horrific displays of violence on screen, they even make reference to this in ‚ÄúMen Against Fire.‚Äù Seneca‚Äôs plays would also have moral harangue which is similar to season 3 episode 6 of Black Mirror where Bing gets his own show at the end of the episode where verbally assaults his audience about how they participate in the society they are all in. Also on an unrelated note, Seneca had a fascination with the super natural, much like Black Mirror's fascination with technological dystopias.",0,0

NEVER HEARING THE FATHER VOICE.Many People when Jesus comes are gonna say didn't we do miracles didn't we heal or cast out demons DIDNT WE ATTEND CHURCH but Jesus is gonna say depart from me I never knew you because you were told that God's Law was the Old covenant and that going to Church on Sunday is sufficient to go-to Heaven.REPENTANCE,OBEDIENCE AND LOVE ARE THE ONLY WAY TO HEAVEN.

btSvAjUrBhU,"Grace! I have been watching you since your first appearance on AGT. I think as of last week I had heard and seen everything 'Grace' out there. Then Austin and BANG, you blew my mind all over again. 4 new songs that are off the charts young lady. You seem to have an excellent crew on top of so much of what makes this whole thing work in this next phase I see you in.\\n\\nIn my opinion, you have knocked the new Album to a top 10 position on the Pop Charts. As you have said about AGT, ‚ÄòMiracles do Happen‚Äô. Don‚Äôt be too surprised, this is destined to greatness and if there were award shows in December 2017 coming up, you are winning some great honors. If you do that‚Ä¶if it happens that fast, it would be like a world record of Unbelievable Songs, Great Lyrics, Great Ideas, flowing, and Miss VanderWaal's two other huge traits.¬†\\n\\nAs a singer she has transformed herself into a dramatic belter with the croaky voice when she wants it. But her voice is smoothing out BIG TIME and her control has become so apparent, which I didn‚Äôt expect so soon. This Austin Show, the act with the keys, drums and guitar was simple astounding!\\n\\nHow can you possibly get this ‚Äòso polished so fast‚Äô. And to know you will continue to grow and bend and change and probably blow us away again in 6 months or so.¬†\\n\\nThe clich√© many comparisons have been made and I'm form the sixties and a musician all my life. She elicits memories to Bob Dylan, and the great poets of that era as well. Second, as a performer she has been aware of her abilities to elicit certain responses in her songs and performance from the words to the color of the lights to pretty much the whole show.\\n\\nThe way she commanded the ACL stage was her incredible ‚Äòtrying to please and make safe, the world‚Äô energy coming together with what I think is the idea that she was a flower opening up and to see that manifest so quickly must be applauded. She reminded me of Bruce Springsteen. Dancing moving, looking so professional. I know you could write a book about reflections of a 18 mos and how to get this kind off transformation to happen. Maybe keep that a secret for a while.\\n\\nThe ACL show could not have been more you and not more professional. You had an extremely talented band who were taking directions of a 13 yr old and paying you total love and support with their smiles and eyes watching you; paying you huge respect and love. Who does this? Grace does. Especially your Austin guitarist was so communicative with her glances at you that I thought to put her on the full tour coming up, if you get her.\\n\\nI have seen nothing like this in 30-40 years if ever. Michael Jackson comes to mind. Congratulations Grace on everything do you; you deserve it an more to come. And we‚Äôre all happy that Grace tries to just be Grace without putting on too much pressure. Please.\\n\\nDe-stress in mediation. Don‚Äôt treat the treehouse as a summer 1 week vacation spot. Go there!",0,0

FN5n87Gj0LM,"It's not really to do with the execution of tragedy and catharsis.  It's popular because it doesn't make the point obvious.  You're inclined to watch it from the start because you want to figure out what weird thing is happening.  The endings are often twists.  The structure lends itself to catharsis but many stories do.  It departs from the typical story arch though, you're rewarded with satisfaction in knowledge rather than satisfaction in resolution.  If you've any interest in marketing things to gen-Xers and Millenials you'll understand why that's important.",0,0

I feel that both, BMs first episode and the idea behind Idiocracy are brilliant, but I've always said I feel they hit to close to home. I've despised the people tuning in on the Prime Minister's misery in the first episode of BM, while realising that, by watching the show, I was one of them. The uneasy feeling of voyeurism while being helpless to do something to relief the PM's pain is unbearable. Idiocracy on the other simply didn't make me laugh. Not because it wasn't hilarious but because it was too close to our modern day reality. When a certain president was elected last year I couldn't stop thinking about how shockingly close we are to what was meant to be a socio-political satire.",0,0

It also seems a lot like torture-porn? \\n\\nLike, look how miserable we can make those people, and how they don't deserve it, and how they can't get out and it's depressing and disgusting. Watch how we can take all kinds of people and put them through all kinds of crap. Enjoy how they get emotionally broken! Be amazed at how _original_ the torture is, too! \\nObviously that will make me feel heavy emotions. It still feels like a sort of Hunger Games.

A better comparison would be that it's about the future after the downside has been revealed: Facebook, not when it was hey!

FN5n87Gj0LM,"Black Mirror seems to me like a good example of cyberpunk, with the emphases on advancing technology and the resulting dystopian elements, especially in regards to economic class. However, I think the more plausible sub-genre of science fiction is a sub-genre known as post-cyberpunk, in which the sheer number of issues stay the same; some problems are solved with technology while new ones arise. This, I believe, is what we've seen with past advances in technology. For example, the development of antibiotics was a profound achievement in medicine, but it is also because of those antibiotics that we now worry about antibiotic-resistant bacteria. I did recall that the various iterations of Ghost in the Shell are an example of post-cyberpunk, especially the Stand-Alone Complex series. I think the sub-genre of post-cyberpunk has a lot of potential, perhaps even involving stories analogous to other sub-genres. Imagine, for example, a space opera, except instead of being set in space, it's set in a vast sea in the distant future, where the design elements of the sea-borne vessels and the marine life can often overlap...",0,0
FN5n87Gj0LM,"I actually really regret watching black mirror, it just lingers as a dark spot i my mind. I think that if we want honesty, there is plenty to go around, but in entertainment this is just not for me at least. (Not meaning all honesty, but the total display of parade of tragedies) This does not make the show inherently bad, but I do think that for many people like myself, we just do not want or need to occupy our time with it. I don't find it challenging or developing in any way, it has just conjured grief and unease. \\n\\nI still loved your composition of the video, and I am a huge fan of your content.

FN5n87Gj0LM,"Spoiler alert for the following: Season 3 Episode 1,3,&5, Season 1 Episode 3 of Black Mirror as well as Oedipus.  Hopefully you‚Äôve read it by now.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI don‚Äôt think anyone is actually going to read this but if you would like an opposing viewpoint to this article, please continue. I‚Äôll try to keep it brief, this is a youtube comment after all.\\n\\nSo I feel like you‚Äôre slightly off on your point. When you talk about Catharsis around the 1:10 mark you say that Black Mirror only has Catharsis when the characters in the story experience relief which happens in season 3 episode one and season 3 episode 6. If you look back at Oedipus for example you actually don‚Äôt have that experience, when Oedipus experiences his anagnorisis he has blinded himself and is banished from Thebes. My point is, to evoke Catharsis you don‚Äôt need a moment of relief or a happy ending, you need peripeteia where the protagonist‚Äôs fortune changes from good to bad and an anagnorisis where the protagonist has a shift from ignorance to knowledge, which Black Mirror has, for example the ending of ‚ÄúShut up and Dance‚Äù when Kenny is caught by the police.\\n\\nAlso just to throw my hat into the ring about the meaning of Catharsis. If you take a look at Greek society when they embrace the idea of ideal forms. This part of Greek society did not believe in an afterlife so they believed the only way to achieve immortality was through being remembered which typically meant through wars. The idea of Catharsis was to purge emotions such as pity and fear from the audience so that they were not seen as weak and could become ideal men. \\n\\nAll of this being said I would assert that Black Mirror has a closer resemblance to the roman playwright Seneca as opposed to Aristotle. The first big difference between Seneca and Aristotle was that Seneca allowed violence to be displayed on stage. For example in his version of Oedipus when Jocasta realizes what has happened she rushes to the front of the stage, cuts open her uterus and bleeds out on stage as opposed to Aristotle having her hung off stage. As we have seen in several episodes throughout the series, they are not afraid of horrific displays of violence on screen, they even make reference to this in ‚ÄúMen Against Fire.‚Äù Seneca‚Äôs plays would also have moral harangue which is similar to season 3 episode 6 of Black Mirror where Bing gets his own show at the end of the episode where verbally assaults his audience about how they participate in the society they are all in. Also on an unrelated note, Seneca had a fascination with the super natural, much like Black Mirror's fascination with technological dystopias.",0,0

btSvAjUrBhU,"Grace! I have been watching you since your first appearance on AGT. I think as of last week I had heard and seen everything 'Grace' out there. Then Austin and BANG, you blew my mind all over again. 4 new songs that are off the charts young lady. You seem to have an excellent crew on top of so much of what makes this whole thing work in this next phase I see you in.\\n\\nIn my opinion, you have knocked the new Album to a top 10 position on the Pop Charts. As you have said about AGT, ‚ÄòMiracles do Happen‚Äô. Don‚Äôt be too surprised, this is destined to greatness and if there were award shows in December 2017 coming up, you are winning some great honors. If you do that‚Ä¶if it happens that fast, it would be like a world record of Unbelievable Songs, Great Lyrics, Great Ideas, flowing, and Miss VanderWaal's two other huge traits.¬†\\n\\nAs a singer she has transformed herself into a dramatic belter with the croaky voice when she wants it. But her voice is smoothing out BIG TIME and her control has become so apparent, which I didn‚Äôt expect so soon. This Austin Show, the act with the keys, drums and guitar was simple astounding!\\n\\nHow can you possibly get this ‚Äòso polished so fast‚Äô. And to know you will continue to grow and bend and change and probably blow us away again in 6 months or so.¬†\\n\\nThe clich√© many comparisons have been made and I'm form the sixties and a musician all my life. She elicits memories to Bob Dylan, and the great poets of that era as well. Second, as a performer she has been aware of her abilities to elicit certain responses in her songs and performance from the words to the color of the lights to pretty much the whole show.\\n\\nThe way she commanded the ACL stage was her incredible ‚Äòtrying to please and make safe, the world‚Äô energy coming together with what I think is the idea that she was a flower opening up and to see that manifest so quickly must be applauded. She reminded me of Bruce Springsteen. Dancing moving, looking so professional. I know you could write a book about reflections of a 18 mos and how to get this kind off transformation to happen. Maybe keep that a secret for a while.\\n\\nThe ACL show could not have been more you and not more professional. You had an extremely talented band who were taking directions of a 13 yr old and paying you total love and support with their smiles and eyes watching you; paying you huge respect and love. Who does this? Grace does. Especially your Austin guitarist was so communicative with her glances at you that I thought to put her on the full tour coming up, if you get her.\\n\\nI have seen nothing like this in 30-40 years if ever. Michael Jackson comes to mind. Congratulations Grace on everything do you; you deserve it an more to come. And we‚Äôre all happy that Grace tries to just be Grace without putting on too much pressure. Please.\\n\\nDe-stress in mediation. Don‚Äôt treat the treehouse as a summer 1 week vacation spot. Go there!",10,2

T2rqOvijMBk,"Dogs must have been sent to us by God to teach us about love, loyalty and empathy. I am so in love with my dogs and find their comfort and availability to my soul as a medicine for good living. \\nIt's also Gods practical joke on us. Why you say ?\\nBecause we raise them from tiny pups to seniors when they need us the most. \\nOur undying love has no bounds and just when you can't love them anymore than you are capable of, they die. Why do they have to die after such a short life with us. It's not fair at all. \\nIt used to make me angry at our creator and then I realized why it is the way it is. \\nDogs and cats( if your a feline lover) in my case dogs, have taught me to Love unconditionally, to Love without judgement, to care for others even if they are strangers. \\nWhen one of my dogs passes away , I take those wonderful memories and lessons learned and practice them in the real world with everyone I meet. \\nI have loved and lived with many dogs in my 60 yrs. and I am convinced that dogs are every bit as important as people and in MOST CASES they are preferable to people.  They forgive so quickly and without judgement or grudge and reward us with their love and their capacity to see us for what we are to them. \\nThey don't care if your ugly or handsome , rich or poor. \\nTheir home is wherever you are and that's seems to be enough for them. \\nHow wonderful would it be if we all were as non judgmental and loyal and loving as our pets are to us. \\nI dread the passing of my only dog left Linus. He is my best friend, my confidante and my audience for life. \\nWhen he is gone, I hope I go with him. I don't think I could ever go through this loss again. But: I say that every time my dog dies and all it takes for me is to see or find another dog that looks into my soul and needs me as much as I need them and I bring them home to their new home, our home, our place , the place where this dog will repeat the process all over again. \\nI don't think it's a mistake that dog spelled backwards is GOD!!!\\nThank you God\\nFor Dogs!!

Like how the hell do you get killed by zombies who just walk toward you limping and shit? Like if I personally met zombies that move like that in real life, I think I can take on 100 or maybe 1000 at once with enough space like on a baseball field with a small hammer. Getting killed by those zombies. It's like getting crushed by bus that's coming toward you at 5mph honking for 5 minutes with you standing there screaming non-stop for 5 minutes.

T2rqOvijMBk,"Dogs must have been sent to us by God to teach us about love, loyalty and empathy. I am so in love with my dogs and find their comfort and availability to my soul as a medicine for good living. \\nIt's also Gods practical joke on us. Why you say ?\\nBecause we raise them from tiny pups to seniors when they need us the most. \\nOur undying love has no bounds and just when you can't love them anymore than you are capable of, they die. Why do they have to die after such a short life with us. It's not fair at all. \\nIt used to make me angry at our creator and then I realized why it is the way it is. \\nDogs and cats( if your a feline lover) in my case dogs, have taught me to Love unconditionally, to Love without judgement, to care for others even if they are strangers. \\nWhen one of my dogs passes away , I take those wonderful memories and lessons learned and practice them in the real world with everyone I meet. \\nI have loved and lived with many dogs in my 60 yrs. and I am convinced that dogs are every bit as important as people and in MOST CASES they are preferable to people.  They forgive so quickly and without judgement or grudge and reward us with their love and their capacity to see us for what we are to them. \\nThey don't care if your ugly or handsome , rich or poor. \\nTheir home is wherever you are and that's seems to be enough for them. \\nHow wonderful would it be if we all were as non judgmental and loyal and loving as our pets are to us. \\nI dread the passing of my only dog left Linus. He is my best friend, my confidante and my audience for life. \\nWhen he is gone, I hope I go with him. I don't think I could ever go through this loss again. But: I say that every time my dog dies and all it takes for me is to see or find another dog that looks into my soul and needs me as much as I need them and I bring them home to their new home, our home, our place , the place where this dog will repeat the process all over again. \\nI don't think it's a mistake that dog spelled backwards is GOD!!!\\nThank you God\\nFor Dogs!!

GDrudkqrgIA,"Paul Ryan talks about being there for his constituents and yet he repeatedly tried to pass a healthcare bill that was so egregious and horrendous that only 17% of the American public were in favor of the bill.  Paul Ryan is desperate to pass tax cuts for the rich and both the healthcare bill he proposed and the tax cuts proposed were both designed to help the rich and powerful.\\n\\nPaul Ryan is disingenuous at best!  The reality is that Paul Ryan only cares about the rich and is flat out lying when he says the Republicans want to pass bills to benefit the people when only 17% of the people were in favor of his healthcare bill.  He didn't stop trying to pass  the bill and tell his fellow Republicans they have a bad bill since only 17% of America supports the bill, did he?  No, because he didn't care what the people of America wanted or what is good for the people of America, he only cared about his rich donors and how passing the healthcare bill would benefit them and the same holds true for the tax cut bill!\\n\\nThe Tax Cut plan is one created by the rich for the rich!\\n\\nThe reality is that the poorest people will see an income tax increase from 10% to 12% so that group will definitely pay more.  While some middle class Americans may fall into a lower tax bracket, they may not actually realize a reduction in overall taxes owed because this tax cut plan eliminates the deduction for state and local taxes.  Since you lose the ability to deduct those taxes your net tax burden could be higher which takes more money out of your pocket.\\n\\nThis is clearly a tax plan for the rich!  The richest Americans and companies will realize HUGE tax reductions.  This plan eliminates the estate tax which only benefits the wealthiest Americans, like Donald Trump!  This plan allows for pass through tax rate for LLCs.  Companies set up as LLCs will be taxed at the much lower individual tax rate versus the corporate tax rate.   Corporations will also realize a huge tax cut before deductions and tax loopholes.  \\n\\nThe overall reality is that the very poorest Americans will see a tax increase, some Americans in the middle class may realize a modest tax savings but many will see no tax savings due to the loss of the state and local tax deduction.  The wealthier Americans and corporations will realize a HUGE tax savings!\\n\\nDonald Trump wants the middle class to believe he is giving them a substantial tax cut by reducing the tax percentage for middle class Americans but in reality he is increasing the taxes owed for many middle class and poor Americans by eliminating the state and local tax deductions.  \\n\\nThis is a shell game concocted by Donald Trump and company to benefit the richest Americans and corporations!\\n\\nI watched an interview a couple of weeks ago with either Steve Mnuchin or Gary Cohn, sorry but I don't remember which one it was, in which he was asked how this tax plan will benefit Donald Trump and he sidestepped the question by saying the American people only want to know how this plan will benefit them.  I believe he would not answer the question directly because the answer would be terribly embarrassing for the President.  The people who put this tax plan together do not want you to realize how well this benefits them versus the average American! \\n\\nBefore you decide to praise Donald Trump and company for cutting taxes you need them to tell you how this plan benefits them, in dollars, versus the average American.\\n\\nDonald Trump's plan may give breadcrumbs to a limited number of people in the middle class to make them think he cares about them, while he and his rich donors and friends raid the bakery of the finest pastries!",0,0

To me this is a best of both words scenerio, because her biggest fans can feel closer to her and closer to eachother but she also gains tremendous insights to work from and keep her loyal fans happy. This also lets her control the dialog between her and her fans and cuts out the middle man. YES its a business choice but the bottom line is she is also serving her fans by doing so. no harm no foul.",0,2

hkA2a4_tNOs,"The Emojo Movie is illegal - then continues to state reasons and examples why ALL movies are by definition 'illegal'... and then, mention a reason why it's not illegal - (not clickbait, huh?)\\n\\nThen go on to make your final point, that it's unfair that movies aren't judged by the same criteria as other media when it comes to advertising. I mean, I've hung around despite all the hate to this channel because I enjoy the content, but this video really took the biscuit for me.\\n\\nFirstly, I would HATE IT if any/all movies took me out of the moment of a film to display a 'sponsored by' tag. And secondly, a huge majority of audiences are probably aware of the issues around sponsored advertising in movies. Any time a branded company comes up, it's kinda guaranteed it's a paid promotion, with no need for clarity - but as you mentioned yourself, if you didn't specify the lack of sponsorship around Diet Coke, then we would assume a similar thing, because we expect that everything is in place for a reason, and product placement is in place for advertising...\\n\\nCould the practice be cleaned up? Yeah, of course... but instead of making a video about information that's completely nullified at the end (and pretty obvious too, I mean of course it's no illegal, because all movies do exactly the same thing), then what you should have done is state at the beginning 'no, the movie is not illegal because of this, this and this' and then spend the rest of the video explaining why this isn't fair and what solutions could fix this seeming disparity.\\n\\nBut of course, doing that would make this video title pretty clickbaity - something that's frowned upon on this website, the same way that camping is frowned upon in gaming circles, despite them both being valid but equally 'unfair' ways of gaining an advantage over competitors...",0,0

Call of Duty Advanced Warfare and World of Warcraft maybe? MAYBE Call of Duty since they actually have an app on iOS and Android, but the only other thing they could've done is make a plot around fake apps, and by then a lot of people might've been fairly confused.\\nIt was easier to include apps that people already know, that people are already familiar with. It's supposed to represent our real world and what might be going on in our phones when things get screwy with them. Even if they were paid for every single one of those product integrations for the storyline, they weren't really as invasive as people made them out to be.\\nThe first thing you SEE on a smart phone when you unlock it, are of course your apps that you have on the main screen.. Makes sense for them to place it on their main screens too.  I would've actually been disappointed if they didn't use some of the apps in the movie for story just to portray to us how the smartphone runs them in their own sense..\\nI want you to picture the movie, if it didn't have the apps in them at all, or fake apps that no one's ever heard of before.

This can easily be done over 30 years through the use of a large solar sail that would use the thrust of the sun's rays to slowly push it to a higher orbit.  Then after 30 years, a small ion rocket can be docked to the station and used to shove it towards the moon, with minimal use of fuel, at minimal cost.  This is how the sail would work:   2 sails that rotate, opposite to each other to counter their torque.  On the side of the orbit where the craft is approaching the sun, the sails are rotated so that the sunlight does NOT hit the surface material of the sails.  On the side of the orbit where the craft is going away from the sun, the sails are rotated to get the maximum amount of sunlight hitting them.  You get only a few ounces of thrust on each orbit but this slowly adds up over time.",0,0

YicuZ0gYH_o,"Nice, I can post here what I recently posted to VSauce3's Why Mars video:\\n\\nWhether you want humans to make it to space for science or for a guarantee against extinction, an initial orb bound colonization push is not the way to go. Anything we want to do, whether its research, terraforming, or resource procurement, on this solar system's celestial orbs can be done better with a close range mobile space station that can provide both human maintenance support for autonomous robots and/or direct remote control. Even the latest mumblings about a US/Russia co-op fuel depot on the moon is short sighted imo, because it doesn't take into account a more accessible resource for said hydrogen, which are asteroids. We should instead look to a stable Lagrange point and start herding asteroids there. Our first permanent space habitats should be built inside the building blocks of the universe, asteroids themselves. This is because the three biggest problems to manned spaceflight (the lack of earth gravity, exposure to solar cosmic radiation, and debris/micrometeorite collisions) can all be solved within the confines of an asteroid. Counter-rotating-paired-centrifuges can replicate earth gravity and with them being built inside a c-type carbonaceous asteroid, it means they will be protected against solar/cosmic radiation and debris/micrometeorite collisions. Having herded many asteroids to said Lagrange point means you can have some for space habitats, others for zero-g installations like giant hallowed out aeroponic food farms, and others just for close range resource procurement. In colloquial speech, before we build our sky castles we have to build mud huts first.\\n-\\nAnd to add to all this, we would also be killing 2 birds with one stone as learning how to manipulate asteroid trajectories for the safety of earth is already a pressing matter we need to learn how to do.",1,0

Beside that why they should spend all the money for real mission and risk their lives when simply can took all the money and just make a fake.

YicuZ0gYH_o,"If people here understood the timeline for Global Warming then they would understand why there is  mad rush to colonize Mars as quickly as possible.\\nSorry folks but the 2100 timeline is a lie.\\nSo too is the 2050 timeline.\\nMars One is slated to send people on a one way trip to Mars in 2022. The reasoning for a one way trip is that there won't be anything to come back to.\\nNo child today will reach the current age of their parent. That is how dire the Global Warming situation is. \\nOh yeah. It is also unstoppable.\\nAll those plans to stop Global Warming?\\nJust a giant ploy to fool the people staying on Earth.\\nEven the Mars Missions are deeply flawed. The radiation from the Sun will severely damage an astronaut's brain if they cannot build a ship that filters out that radiation. One way is to line the ship with a layer of water. The ship would have an outer and inner shell with water in between. The water would stop the radiation from entering the cabin. But water is heavy and would require far more energy to get it off the Earth. So they have to build such a ship in space.\\nHence the space station.\\nBy 2022, the weather systems on Earth will be so unpredictable that building space travel and launching it will be impossible to do on Earth's surface.\\nAs for money priorities?\\nYes there are priorities. Spend money to preserve the human race on another planet or waste that money trying to stop Global Warming that is unstoppable due to civilization being built around the very substance that causes it, fossil fuels. The timeline for Global Warming is just way too short. We waited too long to act. We should have acted in 1990 and at the very latest 1996. We are 20 years too late now. Feedback loops once started are impossible to stop. One of the latest is the thawing of the permafrost. So we can spend money here only to fail or we can spend money on space travel that has a sliver of a chance to succeed. That is where the priorities stand.\\nElon Musk knows about the priorities.\\nBasically the only money that will be spent on Earth will be for ways to fool the public into believing that Global Warming is not real or that Earth dwelling people have lots of time left. Meanwhile buying governments time to send as many people to Mars as possible. The candidates must be strong and preferably young. Elon Musk is going along with any other healthy person. Trump's children have a chance to go too. \\nThe price for such a trip has fallen to a mere $200,000 per ticket. A price that most of us cannot afford. It's also one of the reasons the middle class has been wiped out by the government. Only the rich can afford to be tested to go. The rest of us will be lied to until it is even too late for us to leave. And that will be after 2024.\\nWhat many people don't know about Global warming is that it is really speeding up. It is accelerating exponentially.\\nThis is how bad it really is.\\nGlobal Temperatures under natural circumstances change by 1 degree over periods 500 to 2,000 years. You should not be able to see a change in climate within your entire lifetime. \\nBetween February 2015 and February 2016, the average Global Temperature changed by half a degree.\\nhttp://www.climatecentral.org/news/world-flirts-with-1.5C-threshold-20260\\nThat means that global temperatures are now changing by 1 degree every 2 years. That is how fast it has gotten. \\nBy 2022, the world will have warmed by an additional 2 to 3 degrees bringing a total change by at least 4 degrees. \\nRemember I did say it is speeding up so it is very probable that you can see even higher increases in the next few years. The permafrost just started thawing 2 years ago. We haven't felt it's full impact yet. By 2022 the average global temperature could rise by as much as 6 or even 8 degrees. But even at 4 degree of warming, most of the world's forest will be burning and we really need the oxygen they supply us with. At 10% of atmospheric oxygen levels, human death occurs. If we lose even half of the world's forests due to forest fires then...\\nWe are up Shit Creek without a paddle and the only boat leaving costs more money than most of us can afford.\\nHave a nice day.",0,0

hkA2a4_tNOs,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand The Emoji Movie. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Gene's  nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike the Emoji Movie truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Eggplant's  existential catchphrase What‚Äôs up Hi-5?  which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them.\\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have an Emoji Movie tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

But it doesn't have to, since it says all media. When it says like television and magazines, the word like means including, but not limited to. Television and magazines were just examples.

You're still on the TRENDING PAGE with this shit, you're a poster boy for this website. Product placement/integration in a film is another beast entirely, one doesn't have to say it's specifically product placement; this is a channel about FILM, right? You should know this, Mr. Harker (yes, I saw those and actually liked your acting). You are blatantly taking snippets from DIFFERENT sections that DO NOT APPLY to FILM to make your point. Seriously WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING??!! Clearly, you're shitting the bed and your hack team are laughing at you. I LOVE HOW YOUR TAKING THE RULES OF AN INTERNET VIDEO SPONSORSHIP AND APPLYING IT TO FILM! Do me a solid and apply your shit logic to television, you'll see that you're wrong. Do you even have a research team? Applying social media FTC rules to film, you're not even trying to hide it. Non-verbal sounds like woah, that sentence is an oxymoron, ya oxymoron. With your flimsy, not sound logic we can infer that you need to be blatant about your mention of Sno Caps and whether or not it's sponsored; you're doing well making sure the audience knows you're not sponsored by the Coca~Cola company. Thank you for making my point: YouTube videos aren't movies. Dabs... your core audience is children now? What happened to making sure the tits are real or not? Like the good 'ole days? Huh? Finally, a voice of reason. You're pointing out how bad a show is to your audience that are probably made up of the folks who watches the show. Money is exchanged for a product to appear in a film (again you should know this), this money goes into the budget, which should go into the production. You make an arguable point, the content on the internet (especially YouTube) rides a fine line because one doesn't know whether or not it's sponsored since you and others try to make a community thus blurring the lines between fact and fiction. Are you making films or television shows (FOR THE TV)? No? Then you aren't trying to craft a form of story which would have it's narrative interrupted by stating whether or not it's an advertisement. A system that's rigged against you? You're on the trending tab... you are YouTube's darling, if you ask nicely I bet they'll suck your cock. Oh, you're on government watchlists? This hack sellout gave the Pope a Steam key, PUT HIM ON THE TERROR WATCHLIST. Give me a fucking break.",0,0

uB_Kx6T3wq4,"Hey, so I've been a really big fan of yours for a long time (through multiple phone changes-and therefore YouTube changes) and you really started my passion for makeup. You literally taught me everything I know. But here lately, you're very different and not so much in a good way. From what I see, everything has gone to your head. I think this whole Morphe, ULTA, repackaging thing was the last straw for me. I personally don't care, I don't feel jipped, I care about the shadows, not the packaging and shade names. But I feel like alot of your other fans do and they are hurt by it. I feel like you now care more about Morphe and making money via that route rather than your subscribers and building yourself up on YouTube. There are huge opportunities here, larger than what you've already achieved and you're more concerned about putting money in Morphe's pocket hoping to make a cut than furthering YOU and the platform that has given you the opportunties that you have. Just my two cents.",0,0
uB_Kx6T3wq4,"Jaclyn, I‚Äôm not sure if you have seen it but Courtelizz1 did an amazing video on your morphe collab.

uB_Kx6T3wq4,she thinks her shit doesn‚Äôt stink just because she has so much money... Her subscribers are the ones who helped her get to where she is today which she never acknowledges that. She‚Äôs honestly the most inconsistent you tuber I follow. The only time she ever posts a video is if new a Morphe pallete is launching or if it‚Äôs a look on her pallete... there are so many other YouTubers  who work their asses off to get to where they are and post 2 to 3 videos a week every single week while Jaclyn is over there hanging out in her custom-made closet that all her subscribers paid for!,0,1

hkA2a4_tNOs,"Wait!  So does that mean that every time YouTube forces me to watch a commercial, it is illegal?  The YouTuber himself, or herself, doesn't tell me that they are sponsored by that particular product; and I'm certain it is safe to assume the YouTuber is not aware of every commercial that plays on each and every video (especially since those commercials change each time you watch the same video).  Moreover, YouTube videos are constantly interrupted by commercials at the most random times.  These commercials are usually unskipable and can last anywhere from 10 seconds to 10 minutes!\\n\\nIt's too bad YouTube doesn't have a subscription service that allows you to avoid commercials for a monthly fee.  If they do have one, they do a terrible job advertising it (which in itself sounds highly unethical, if not illegal).\\n\\nI pity YouTubers.  It genuinely looks like they are taken advantage of by Google and other major corporations.  When YouTubers like Markiplier and Jacksepticeye tell their audiences that they haven't had a single day off in years because they have to keep putting videos up, I am reminded of the lack of labor laws that existed before President Theodore Roosevelt took a stand against corporations.\\n\\nSince YouTube is an American company, perhaps it is time for the federal government to open an investigation on them.",0,0

And why does the detective say that they are both ''clean in the same scene with the cameras? Why does the colonel say I will not be called a murderer in my own home when it was mark's house? Why does Damien in the first episode say, try not to rob me *blind* again? Why do both the butler and the chef shrug their shoulders to act all innocent when the detective says I dont trust anyone? Is this connected to the scene with the cameras? And right before that, the butler asks the colonel if he and mark were the same age. What does that mean? And how could an entire body just disappear in the end of episode 1? Where did it go? Why was the detective keeping tabs on the colonel? Who is the groundskeeper?

This would also explain why the characters have been at a 2-year community college for 4 years and why all of the characters are so diverse in ethnicity and personality and background, each a part of himself.

A Mars Hyperloop at the equator will be at a the warmest spot on the planet, building a mag lev around its equator.. even a rubber band loop would immediately start to generate a radiation shield and provide transport between substations and colonies.. we're pretty good at building trains to bring us together.

hkA2a4_tNOs,"This video is really great, and totally factual. I have only one problem. The emoji movie did not break the law, and here's why. Guidances and Regulations are VERY different. Regulations are enforceable by law. Guidances are the FCC's INTERPRETATION of the regulations. Guidances are NOT legally enforceable. They are most useful in lawsuits- most juries will misinterpret FCC's guidances as part of their regulations. A good defence lawyer will  shut those thoughts down quickly (And you better believe the Emoji Movie has the money to hire GREAT lawyers). Technically, the emoji movie DID NOT break any regulations... even though they broke virtually ALL the guidances. If it's brought to court, the emoji movie will win that lawsuit, even though it doesn't seem fair and IT TOTALLY SUCKED. FCC has good lawyers backing them, and these lawyers know all this. That's why no one is pressing the issue.",0,0

A Mars Hyperloop at the equator will be at a the warmest spot on the planet, building a mag lev around its equator.. even a rubber band loop would immediately start to generate a radiation shield and provide transport between substations and colonies.. we're pretty good at building trains to bring us together.

Hazel shouldn't of brought the child in it period! the saddest part of this video is her rolling weed and on top of bragging about giving her 5 year old son permission to cuss out Hazel, that's never ok a child needs to stay in a child's place and you don't involve kids in grown people's mess, this video was soooooo long for someone who doesn't care and just like Hazel this woman is a bragger.  let me pray for all of them",0,1
