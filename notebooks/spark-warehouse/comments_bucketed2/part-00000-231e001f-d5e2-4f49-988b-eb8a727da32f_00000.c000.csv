Mr. Trump offered solutions while she offered global promises. I was highly OFFENDED that she lumped me into a basket of 'deplorables'. Her NOT understanding how that affected many Americans is the reason she lost.  Until she understands that she will continue to blame everyone but herself.  I didn't hear her accepting any blame here. Jane Pauley ends the interview by saying she did, but she didn't.  She lost because she had nothing to offer, no hope or promise of a change for those of us who struggle to pay the bills.  She promised all kinds of things and all kinds of money to everyone and everywhere in the world.  To everyone but 'us'.  Trump's not perfect by any stretch, but at least he offered a chance for change and to make Amercia great again.  And if you already thought it was great...you probably voted for Hillary.  For most of us, it has not been great for awhile.",2,0

She lives in a bubble of incessant dog-ate-my-homework excuses about her own incompetence and gross negligence regarding matters of grave importance, which happen to be real: national security, and the conduct of American embassies abroad. She clings to the nauseating presumption that she has sheer class entitlement to rise, by nepotism, up some kind of government corporate ladder. If anything is Putinesque, this is, not to mention the endless race-baiting cultural Marxist lingo the Democrats incessantly borrow from Russia and Mao. To top it off, she STILL considers half of America to be deplorable. \\n\\nIt is the Democrats who both historically and today cannot give up the race-baiting. They insist that race and other irrelevant categories of social science are the be all and end all of being. This merely exposes their stupidity. Not insensitivity, though it certainly is that. But stupidity. Absolutely disqualifying for high office.",0,0

DdA7tUIzA5Q,This song is wack. Her and Janet really put a nail in their career with the overly sexy image. Toni's 2nd album will always be her best work. Her sultry voice is best suited for dramatic ballads. She still has her voice so why is she not using it? If this is the first single I'm not interested in the album.,0,0

8ropWor8aAM,"Really!  Darci really brought her 2 puppets in one performance like I had predicted before.  \\nI can sing a dual song using my 2 different voices all by myself, but I don't want to use puppets.  From the amounts of views and comments in the videos about the AGT's Final videos, the top 2 popularity votes for winning the AGT in this year 2017 are among Angelica and Darci.  I have had talents since the very beginning of my life.  Angelica's or Celine's young-age singing is not surprised to me at all.  In terms of talents, I think Darci shows more talents in the performances than Angelica does.  \\nI have had talents (more than singing) since the very beginning of my life and I have had sad and unfortunate disasters I have been suffering from since the beginning of my life, but I have never signed up for any AGT's, the Voice's, etc....because in my childhood there had been no such opportunities for me and nowadays I have seen the younger children have had much larger probabilities to win in the competitions because most people's 1st preferences in terms of ages have been young children (, and 2nd preferences in terms of ages have been the older people if the scenarios have been not for winning in the finals but only for auditions.), some prefer focusing on the superficial factors, etc... ... and also because I do not want to disclose my age at the beginning.  If there is a fair competition (--At least it looks like fair although the fairness can't be confirmed at the beginning.--) that does not require an age disclose and in which no one or less persons prefer age and superficial factors, I might participate in such a competition.",1,0

DoQEpaQE5-g,The writing is pretty terrible to be honest. That is definitely the weakest part. This story makes no sense. Also very weird vibes between the two main characters. Not sure what is going on there.\nYour art style and animation also do not match. I am constantly expecting snappy and quick animation but it is very awkward and slow. You are wasting time on too many frames.\nI probably wouldn't back this project is this took you two years to make. You also have no mention of solid writers on your igg page. If this is the current writing situation there is no way I could sit through an entire film.,0,0

DoQEpaQE5-g,The writing is pretty terrible to be honest. That is definitely the weakest part. This story makes no sense. Also very weird vibes between the two main characters. Not sure what is going on there.\nYour art style and animation also do not match. I am constantly expecting snappy and quick animation but it is very awkward and slow. You are wasting time on too many frames.\nI probably wouldn't back this project is this took you two years to make. You also have no mention of solid writers on your igg page. If this is the current writing situation there is no way I could sit through an entire film.,0,0

Not sure what is going on there.\nYour art style and animation also do not match. I am constantly expecting snappy and quick animation but it is very awkward and slow. You are wasting time on too many frames.\nI probably wouldn't back this project is this took you two years to make. You also have no mention of solid writers on your igg page.

mUDQvKtkMwE,"September 23, 2017 there will be a sign of the coming of Jesus. There is suppose to an alignment in the stars that is called the Star of Bethlehem which has only appeared in the sky one time in the History of the Earth and that is when it was a sign that that Jesus the Messiah was gonna be born. It is an alignment of the Stars, sun, and moon showing a woman giving birth to a King of all the Nations which is Jesus. This will the first time the stars will align like that since the birth of Jesus. And in the Bible in Revelations it says that the alignment in stars will appear again in the last days so it is a sign Jesus is bout to come back. It doesn't say he is coming back that day cause the God says no man will know the day or hour he is coming back but it is the sign of the return of Jesus. It is an alignment of the Stars, sun, and moon showing a woman giving birth to a King of all the Nations which is Jesus. The woman is The church the body of Christ or the followers of Jesus. The Dragon is the Serpent or Satan. The Bible is telling us what is about to happen on Earth. This is the end of times. Read the Bible scriptures.\\n\\n(Revelations 12:1-17)\\nAnd there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars:\\n\\n2 And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.\\n\\n3 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.\\n\\n4 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.\\n\\n5 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne.\\n\\n6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and threescore days.\\n\\n7 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,\\n\\n8 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in heaven.\\n\\n9 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.\\n\\n10 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night.\\n\\n11 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the death.\\n\\n12 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth that he hath but a short time.\\n\\n13 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.\\n\\n14 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.\\n\\n15 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood.\\n\\n16 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his mouth.\\n\\n17 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.\\n\\nJesus is coming back to get his true loyal followers soon. The rest will be left behind.\\n\\nAccept Jesus as your Lord and Saviour.\\nRepent from all your sins.\\nGet baptized in the name of Jesus.\\nHave a deep relationship with Jesus. \\nFollow Jesus. \\nSpeak the word of God to the world.\\nLead others to Jesus\\nSave souls\\nDo the Lord's will until the end",0,0

I never watched the Big Bang Theory, and will never accept hollywood's joining of satanic/luciferian witchcraft influences, which also embrace perverted and immoral lifestyles. \\n\\nAnd please spare me the conspiracy theory notion. There is so much evidence to show just how evil and disgusting television and movies have become since even the 70's. This late night host Stephen Colbert, among others, is also a liberal progressive, which shows why he allows people like this on his show. Hundreds of thousands of people refuse to watch ANY of these late night hosts. Jay Leno may have been the last one that was even remotely good at all.",0,0

I_JtJHJ4384,"This was policy thrown into a budget bill by an unnamed legislator, which is ridiculous. The legislator should attach his or her name to it unless he or she is embarrassed by that, and if you're embarrassed by a bill, you shouldn't be promoting it. Also, policy stipulations should not be included in a budget bill - there's a completely different type of bill that addresses exactly that. I'm sure you complain about pork barrel additions to resolutions, and that's what this is.\\n\\nI think the other issue people have with it is that it only affects bike and pedestrian infrastructure, but it still allows for roads to be built by condemning property. You make it sound like cyclists want to put a trail right through the middle of a cornfield - in most cases, it's adding a path alongside a freeway or existing road. In addition, the mention of lycra/spandex is completely irrelevant and unnecessary. Many people never wear spandex while riding, and it seems like you're just trying to de-humanize cyclists by bringing that up. If I wore spandex while driving, does that make me less important than drivers wearing jeans and a t-shirt?",2,0

I thought we learned our lesson of our addiction. We can't allow BTS to find out that the reason as to why they get dissed is by an annoying fandom called A.R.MY. We shouldn't disappoint them, we look up to them. No literally, I'm pretty sure even Yoongi is taller than half the fandom. But seriously guys, wouldn't it make the boys sad to see that their fandom is disrespecting other artists?  Anyways, let's focus on the more important thing.

8ijNvyEbQ_g,"Frankies charm, hard work and dedication got him that 9. No the dance was not over scored because unlike Lindsey and Jordan, Frankie has no experience and is learning from the actual bottom. I hope Jordan Frankie and Lindsay make it to the top 3 but just like the judges said  people are coming in at different levels  and just because Frankie isn't at  Lindsay and Jordan's level  doesn't mean he didn't deserve that 9.  to get a nine from Lindsay and Jordan they have to break past what is expected of them and I think the judges know Lindsey and jordan are capable of more  that's why they're making them work harder for that 9. Frankie is working 200 times past what is required or expected of him just to get to the standards of Jordan and Lindsey. So god dammit frankie you deserve that 9. Lol",21,0
8ijNvyEbQ_g,"Made me smile from start to end!!!! You can argue about that 9 all you want, say who else deserved it, etc. but Frankie put his SOUL into that dance, he's so cute!

That had so much potential and it went to waste. I'm going to be really bummed if Arcade turns out to be an improved version of Missions.

SNGWh_-R1VE,To address a lot of peoples concerns:\nThis game does have micro transactions in the sense you spend money to get crates with a chance of giving you better start cards. Better star cards means lower cool down and other minor differences. You can still earn these cards by playing the game. It's no different than Battlefield's battle packs or Overwatch's loot crates. Also all the DLC's are free and you will not be required to buy anything more than just the base game. People need to quit complaining and appreciate the fact that the devs have done so much more this time around. They delivered on most things people asked for and yet people continue to find something else to cry about. How about appreciating the fact we get free DLC's and much more.,1,0

xch78xg1DVc,"*[Educated Speculation below!]*\\nUntil we get an official report, I'll assume it wasn't any single failure (ie flight controls, or pilot blacking out). \\n\\nMy guess is that the pilot came into the maneuver (split S, or some variation of a split S?) with too little altitude and too much airspeed. The effect of entering too low is obvious... too much airspeed is less intuitive, but just as critical. \\n\\nThe Eurofighter, due to its Delta wing, bleeds a lot of airspeed when its pulling hard, and the slower its going, the more speed it bleeds (more induced drag). Slower speed (in this context) means tighter turning radius. When planning maneuvers, they would've factored this into their calculations. The problem comes when the pilot goes into the maneuver just a bit too low and a bit too fast, and maybe with a bit too much power. Why? Well, remember how the induced drag increases as airspeed decreases? At very high speed, the induced drag is so low (even with full back stick!) that the aircraft loses little, if any speed... and the turning radius remains very, very large, making recovery impossible. \\n\\nSource: Obscene amounts of studying fighter aerodynamics.",1,0

Sarà una morte lenta e soffrirò molto. In fondo, quel pilota, è morto subito. In ogni caso, il talismano segreto che porto mi ha già graziato in diverse e tragiche circostanze. La riflessione pacata non è fatta per il web. I porca puttana esclamati, porca puttana Eva rendono vera e viva la profezia di Eco. Il web ci mette di fronte alla nostra pochezza. Quanto all'Eurofighter, ritengo che siano soldi buttati via. Quanto al polverone, faccio aumentare la visibilità del video. Che, ripeto, sarà scordato. Tempo una settimana? Due? Buona visione. Non merita più pena il pilota di un pilota da caccia di quanta ne meriti un camionista che sta consegnando il latte per i vostri figli. Solo che un camionista morto, non va in prima pagina. Riflessioni profonde. Mi scuso per Terracina che non è in Ciociaria ... in Pontinia-Basso Lazio, va bene? Aspetto che mi facciate le pulci pure su questo. Per quelli che non sanno andare oltre le tre righe senza una parolaccia, vi dico Fortunati voi. Potrete con buona speranza aspirare a diventare Presidenti USA Agli altri, capaci di argomentare senza insulti magari anche aspramente, dico Pazienza, nè tu nè io diventeremo mai capo di stato negli Usa, nemmeno se ci naturalizzassero. Saluti. Ps: ogni vita umana persa è un dolore. Solo, qualcuna ha un rilievo mediatico maggiore di altre, milioni di altre. Tutto qui.",0,0

C-V1uXeyGmg,The multiple starts and stops are likely when the laser wasn't pointed at the mirror. That is the wave pattern moved the mirror in such a way that it moved the mirror out of the path of the laser.,6,1

C-V1uXeyGmg,It's an home oscilloscope,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,Hmm changing the shape of the container should change the resonant patterns. Using a thinner membrane will yeild higher sensitivity to higher tones changing the patterns as well. Mylar would work probably. Elasticity of your drum head will further impact your resulting patterns. Nodal point for the reflection and laser angle will affect the patterns also.,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,the inertia of that mirror in that spot effects the way the balloon distorts. try putting another piece of mirror on the other side of the balloon.,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"I think the starts and stops are because the laser is flickering, this might be because of PWM (a method of reducing the brightness of a light by only sending power to it some of the time). I think this because if you go to 5:18 and pause it, you can see there are multiple points. A high shutter would have one short point, not lots of little ones. The laser is turning off and on faster than the camera shutter is opining and closing. That or the camera is taking multiple pics and combining them for some reason.\\nI don't think its roiling shutter, because that just means it is reading the first row of pixels then the second then the 3ed and so on, it should not make any gaps in the image?",0,0

C-V1uXeyGmg,So you created an oscilloscope?,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,Perhaps the tiny mirror's motion carried it out of the laser's beam briefly to create the effect of the multiple starting and ending places in a single frame,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,Maybe the multiple endings and starts is the refraction of the glass around the edges of the mirror?,0,0

We try to act all stern & head-of-household w/them, but deep down, we all know we're completely smitten & would jump thru a field of hoops for just one kitty kiss or outstretched puppy paw against our cheek. Who's really the pet, I wonder? I don't see them fawning over/cleaning up after us. I have always had a true & honest love & respect for our animal friends. They really oftentimes are more kindred to me than my own family/human companions. And they don't judge, so long as u care for them proper. I joke, but it's a win-win, really.

C-V1uXeyGmg,"When there are more frames per second we notice that the light is not a continuous path, it is a dots that move along a path.\\n\\nThis means that when the shutter speed (frames per second) is slow, the light moves along the path a certain distance x, and the camera records this as a continuous path.\\n\\nBetween frames, no data is picked up. This means that if the light is moving unusably fast, we should expect to see no image for a certain distance y.\\n\\nThis explains why there are jumps in the path. At these points the light was moving very fast. To fast for the camera to pick up (its shutter was closed during the movement). \\n\\nThis is supported by the fact that the paths that were missed are all in straight lines. When going around a corner at an unusually high speed, light may still be picked up since it has a width and passes through the same point more than once, increasing its chance pf been recorded. This does not occur for a straight line.",0,0

To avoid saturating the integrators, you camera may be switching in multiple integrator banks, and the gaps you're seeing would be the time taken to perform this switch.\\n\\nIf you wanted to understand it better, try and set up a repeatable system which allows you to measure the length of the missing pieces of the laser path, then back out the time for each gap from the laser's speed. Alternatively, see if you can't get your hands on a more well documented camera module/sensor. For example, I've worked with the Aptina MT9V034 fairly extensively.

C-V1uXeyGmg,"The problem might stem from the fact that most digital cameras have pan and scan sensors. Pan and scan read rows of pixels from left to right before moving to the next row and so on. That could be why the faster laser patterns are causing the breakage problem. Because by the time the pixel row below has scanned, the laser is in a different spot. \\n\\nYou you might be able to try to get around this by filming with a higher shutter speed though that would require testing. If you have an iPhone or Android phone with That capability then that could be a good starting point. If it’s still a problem then you could rent a high end camera with that capability like a Phantom camera. They usually have global shutters. \\n\\nOr you could try and rent a digital camera with a global shutter, which acts like film cameras by taking a snap of the whole sensor at a time.

bY8-TUD3_Zo,we all missed the most important fact Rick says there's infinite dimensions however he can only live in very few universes that are similar why is that it goes to a theory that says each decision you make creates another universe if you watch rixty minutes it's right there and we all missed it its why Rick in all dimensions has the portal gun it's why his family died in the first episode of season 3 it was his memory from an alternate Ricks universe where he chose not to accept it but because it's his memory it was there it was not false go watch rixty minutes again and put 2 and 2 together,1,0

APHgDFRpCi0,"¡Hola a todos y bienvenidos a mi pequeño mundo! Estoy harto... Realmente estoy hasta los mismísimos!! No sé vosotros pero yo estoy muy cansado de la música que se esta haciendo popular hoy en día (bueno... ya hace un tiempo). Lógicamente con la palabra popular ya quedan exentos el rock, el metal, punk, jazz, blues y todos los tipos que sean del estilo. Con música popular me refiero al jodido dubstep, el tecno, la música electrónica, el intento de rap, el intento de reaggue y toda esa música que representa más caras bonitas que a ella misma... Ah! Y por supuesto no me olvido del repetitivo y asqueroso reggaeton. \\n\\nRealmente me siento estafado en este juego que representa la vida, en la parte musical claro. Para mi hemos perdido de calle... (aunque no se contra quien jugamos). Solo sé una cosa... antes lo que se escuchaba era a Freddie Mercury, Bob Marley, Ray Charles... y ahora escuchamos a Kiko Rivera, al Justino Bieber, a varios compositores de reggaeton que nos lo va a conocer ni su madre en unos años, a raperos falsos... De verdad, me gustaría saber que pensarán las generaciones futuras de nuestra música (seguramente que eramos imbéciles...).\\n\\nPorque decidme vosotros... ¿Que ha pasado que ahora parece  mejor un conjunto de sonidos que hacen casi explotar nuestro cerebro y tener ataques epilépticos a un bonito, excelente, currado solo de guitarra? ¿Por que preferimos (la mayoría...) unas voces retocadas con el maldito Auto Tune a un verdadero cantante? ¿Por que hay gente que le gustan esas canciones donde a las mujeres se las trata como animales, como escoria? ¿¿¿¿Qué ha pasado????\\n\\nEn serio, parece que ahora solo triunfan los que encima de una base ponen un montón de efectos, los que tienen una cara bonita y los hacen famosos por esa razón o aquellos que hacen el estilo ya sea rap, reaggue... pero no se les ocurre nada mejor que poner letras estilo reggaeton. Coño! Si quieres hacer rap, reaggue o cualquier otro tipo de música no tienes que ponerle letra como si fuera reggaeton y decir cosas como mis gatitas mamasita... ¡Realmente no lo soporto!\\n\\nAsimismo muchas de las canciones de ahora si os fijáis usas siempre los mismos acordes una y otra vez, ¿No hay imaginación? Supongo que ya la gastan toda con las letras tan originales... \\n\\nTambién quiero decir que con este post no quiero decir que no hayan cantantes buenos, claro que si! Simplemente que ahora forman un grupo reducido en contra de todos los otros. Todo por el jodido dinero...\\nY vuelvo a decir lo mismo... no es que no haya buenos cantantes y buenas canciones, simplemente que no es lo que gusta ahora, no da moneey!!\\n\\nAle... ya me he quedado a gusta dando mi opinión...\\n\\nComo siempre espero que os haya gustado y que nos veamos en el siguiente post!!\\n\\nPero antes de irme... ¿Qué pensáis vosotros?\\n\\nChauuu!!\\nEdit:\\nFuente: http://www.pelibloguista.com/2016/02/la-musica-de-hoy-en-dia-es-pura-mierda.html?m=1",0,0

We try to act all stern & head-of-household w/them, but deep down, we all know we're completely smitten & would jump thru a field of hoops for just one kitty kiss or outstretched puppy paw against our cheek. Who's really the pet, I wonder? I don't see them fawning over/cleaning up after us. I have always had a true & honest love & respect for our animal friends. They really oftentimes are more kindred to me than my own family/human companions. And they don't judge, so long as u care for them proper. I joke, but it's a win-win, really.

C-V1uXeyGmg,Could you not have just opened windows media player for the same effect haha,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"I ran across this video today and it looks very similar to this but is using a completely different method. Its called the shape of music, He has more information on how it works in the description. Are these two methods similar in any way? https://youtu.be/8TxTilR7xu8",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"Really nice idea! What would be also very interesting to know, is if you can predict a composite wave form from two separate ones by addtion of the xy traces. Also what would be an effect of an offset related to that.\\n\\nIn a similar sense ... what would happen if one could take the surface of a disco ball onto a speaker and shine light onto it, or several lasers? What I wonder, would it be possible to see some complete image of the membrane?",0,0

C-V1uXeyGmg,"6:09 >i don't think it's because the laser pulses, otherwise i would have noticed it watching it live\\n\\nNo, you really wouldn't have.  \\n\\nDiodes can be PWM pulsed very quickly, faster than the human eye can hope to see.  LEDs for example are typically pulsed at thousands of pulses per second, the human eye thinks it's just dimming but in reality it's turning full-on & full-off thousands of times per second.",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"The single frame with many lose ends, could it be because the laser leaves the mirror?",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"My first thought would be rolling shutter, but it doesn't have the right artifacting. It could be the physical properties of the mirror fragment itself (such as it being too small, the glass taking an internal reflection, etc.). A high speed camera would really be the only thing I could think of to answer that question.",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"While this a beautiful demo, I can't help but feel that the mirror shard's asymmetry affected the vibrating membrane and gave an unpure reading of the tones you used. Also, why place the mirror somewhere other than the center of the membrane? From the Chladni experiment we know certain sections of the membrane vibrate differently than others for a given time, why not place mirrors at nodes & antinodes and repeat the experiment and compare the laser paths? \\n\\nSemi-related, I know you're interested in visualizing sound, I think liquid cymatics could be a rad project for you (especially using mercury on a speaker with lasers)",0,0

C-V1uXeyGmg,"I'm pretty sure (correct me if i'm wrong) that the segmentation on the freeze frame is due to the way a laser works. it pulses a light on a tube of some crystal, the electrons absorb the energy then emit it again slowly at all the same frequency and direction. then it pulses again. so maybe there's your answer. I'm not sure though",0,0

C-V1uXeyGmg,I made some java-script programs a few years ago to draw Lissajous figures and cycloids which look similar to some of those. Sorry that but you need a khan academy user to view them. https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/mouse-operated-spline-oscilloscope/5921753556320256,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,This was so cool. Instantly my mind jumped to string theory and what strings of vibrating energy look like.,0,0

C-V1uXeyGmg,Use oscilloscope music. I want to see if it will still create the same effect.,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,Those are Lissajous (after the mathematician who first described them)patterns. I thought they were purely theoretical being the quotient of waves. But they do appear in multidimensional membranes as seen here.,0,0

C-V1uXeyGmg,"I think the reason why you get more than one starting point on the laser path is that the mirror turns away from the laser beam a number of times during the time the shutter is open, since the diaphragm would be vibrating at a higher frequency than the shutter of the camera, right?",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"Back in the day, a friend of mine took an old black and white tv set and used it as a basic cathode ray tube wiring the left channel of a stereo across the vertical control and the right channel across the horizontal (or something line that).

C-V1uXeyGmg,"This reminds me of Lissajous Patterns. It is cool how you are generating them with a single signal source. Using an oscilloscope, one must use two signals to control the x and y position of the beam. However, in your setup, the x and y position is controlled by the orientation of your mirror!

C-V1uXeyGmg,"I'd love to see how multiple lasers (perhaps different colours to make analysis easier) interact with each other and if one balloon membrane would have sympathetic vibrations from another speaker.

C-V1uXeyGmg,"At ~ 5:28 when there is a short shutter speed and the contour is broken up, some parts are longer. This suggests that the speed of the laser image is changing along its path, it would be interesting to think of a way of showing this intentionally and looking if there is any further pattern to the behaviour. Perhaps intentionally strobing the laser to produce a finely dotted line to see spacing between them? Any way of changing to colour would be good, the only way I can think of is again strobing the laser but using a 'white' laser with three diodes that fire sequentially.\\n\\nAlso, I wonder how some of these patterns hold up against solving the displacement of the surface of the balloon using bessel functions etc.\\n\\nAnyway great video as always",0,0

C-V1uXeyGmg,Some of the patterns that look distorted or to have many starts and ends are caused by the rolling shutter effect. You can google it if you want to know more details about it and why it makes fast movement look distorted,0,0

bY8-TUD3_Zo,"Matpat I'm disappointed, Rick's tongue isn't an electrode, there are no h+ gated neurons in the neocortex, therefore the acidic compounds wouldn't be able to cause impulses, the presence of sodium is completely irrelevant, the extracellular space is already saturated with sodium, the tongue wouldn't be able to stimulate neurons in the neocortex, which are largely ligand gated with glutamate and GABA for inhibitory neurons.\\n\\nIn fact, the presence of more extracellular sodium would prevent the conduction of action potentials, the electrostatic gradient would be fucked, and potassium would be unable to leave the neuron(like charges repel one another, potassium and sodium are positively charged, the excess of sodium would erase the electrostatic gradient necessary to for ionic conductances).\\n\\n Therefore, even if Rick's tongue managed to drive an action potential in the recently killed roaches neocortex, that would be it; he would get one action potential to fire and the cell would be unable to continue into the falling phase of the AP, leaving it depolarized; as you're no doubt aware, there is no known neuron that can cause a post synaptic action potential with just one spike, the highest they go up to is a post synaptic depolarization of 10 millivolts; which is still about 15 away from threshold potential in a typical neocortical neuron.\\n\\nThe only way a cell would be able to get back to polarized and hyperpolarized would be via passive leak conductances and the sodium potassium pump, which enters a dysfunctional state when there hypernatremia is taking place.\\n\\nSo no, pickle Rick would never get the roach to move like they can move in laboratories with electrodes directly feeding current into the cells.\\n\\nAnd of course there's the issue of how few cells in the neocortex the tongue would even be able to effect, I doubt it would even have effects on layer 3-6.\\n\\nAll in all, sloppy work.",0,0

We try to act all stern & head-of-household w/them, but deep down, we all know we're completely smitten & would jump thru a field of hoops for just one kitty kiss or outstretched puppy paw against our cheek. Who's really the pet, I wonder? I don't see them fawning over/cleaning up after us. I have always had a true & honest love & respect for our animal friends. They really oftentimes are more kindred to me than my own family/human companions. And they don't judge, so long as u care for them proper. I joke, but it's a win-win, really.

C-V1uXeyGmg,i wonder if the mirror was moving out from under the laser when it had multiple ends and starts?,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,Great video thanks :),0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,2:35 this funny pattern here\nIt's a dick.,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,The reason for the many ends is the rolling shutter,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,Why the broken lines?  Easy... It's just the laser missing the mirror when it oscillates too far.,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,4:57 set camera to manual? 5:12 better set camera to manual?,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,the extra start and end points are likely cause by the rolling shutter effect,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,would the light just take the frequencies and display the songs notes on the wall and the switching is just the rapid notes being displayed?,0,0

C-V1uXeyGmg,"That's cool, some of those figures are typical lissajous patterns ... didn't expect them to show up so clearly!",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"Actually, it is the way our inner ear works. We hear geometric patterns.",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,The multiple ends are because of the rolling shutter effect,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"Really nice idea! What would be also very interesting to know, is if you can predict a composite wave form from two separate ones by addtion of the xy traces. Also what would be an effect of an offset related to that.\\n\\nIn a similar sense ... what would happen if one could take the surface of a disco ball onto a speaker and shine light onto it, or several lasers? What I wonder, would it be possible to see some complete image of the membrane?",0,0

C-V1uXeyGmg,OMG MY FRIEND AND I JUST TRIED IT AND IT'S AMAZING WTH WHO THOUGHT OF THIS I JUST WANT TO HUG THAT PERSON,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,This is called a lissajouls figure,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,That effect of having multiple lines in a frame could be that your cameras light sensor segments read each pixel in a line by line format. So as the laser was moving around it might if moved in and out of where the line that was being read at the time was. This is why we get the slanting effect when the camera is moving steadily sideways. The lines at the top or bottom are read first and then each successive line of light sensor segments is read slightly after the first,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,It would be interesting to put two pieces of glass each with their own laser at different locations on the balloon and see how different the projected shapes are simultaneously.,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,I so have to try this.,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,Can we get a full video of just the lazer so we can watch all of it?,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,Nice. Now record that bitch in slowmotion.,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"Maybe because the laser is not hitting the mirror? I mean, it's too small so the vibrations of the baloon membrane could be extreme enough that the laser misses the mirror's aperture",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,I wonder if using a square container would change the shape since the balloon would be stretched differently.,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,Did you use Spaces or Tabs in your code?,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,I feel like in staring into the 4th dimension,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,This needs some square waves.,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,Used to make these for parties in the 90's. 1st surface mirror glued to a speaker and then shot through a spinning quartz crystal.,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"If you hook up the left and right channels of a stereo output to an oscilliscope and, holding one note steady, scan the other note through an octave, say, the harmonics visualization is great. Use the lissajous mode on the oscilliscope which centers each input on 0,0 of an x/y axis. The headphone output of a cheap keyboard is a common available source. The flute or ?French horn might give the best sine wave for the cleanest visualization.",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"Vectorscope, it looks just like it, search up oscilloscope music it looks cool",0,0

C-V1uXeyGmg,it's like a 3d render with laser,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,I wonder what this would look like if you used a piece of a DVD instead of the mirror. I guess it would be interesting to combine it with the interference pattern produced by the DVD.,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,I can't help but feel David Gilmour ought to use this. \n(Seeing how he's still all about them lasers ;),0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,I think is because of the rolling shutter,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,It would be interesting if the results are better if filmed with 60fps,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,Could you not have just opened windows media player for the same effect haha,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"I ran across this video today and it looks very similar to this but is using a completely different method. Its called the shape of music, He has more information on how it works in the description. Are these two methods similar in any way? https://youtu.be/8TxTilR7xu8",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"6:09 >i don't think it's because the laser pulses, otherwise i would have noticed it watching it live\\n\\nNo, you really wouldn't have.  \\n\\nDiodes can be PWM pulsed very quickly, faster than the human eye can hope to see.  LEDs for example are typically pulsed at thousands of pulses per second, the human eye thinks it's just dimming but in reality it's turning full-on & full-off thousands of times per second.",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"The single frame with many lose ends, could it be because the laser leaves the mirror?",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"My first thought would be rolling shutter, but it doesn't have the right artifacting. It could be the physical properties of the mirror fragment itself (such as it being too small, the glass taking an internal reflection, etc.). A high speed camera would really be the only thing I could think of to answer that question.",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"While this a beautiful demo, I can't help but feel that the mirror shard's asymmetry affected the vibrating membrane and gave an unpure reading of the tones you used. Also, why place the mirror somewhere other than the center of the membrane? From the Chladni experiment we know certain sections of the membrane vibrate differently than others for a given time, why not place mirrors at nodes & antinodes and repeat the experiment and compare the laser paths? \\n\\nSemi-related, I know you're interested in visualizing sound, I think liquid cymatics could be a rad project for you (especially using mercury on a speaker with lasers)",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,Instead of you talking to the camera do voiceover. We came here for the laser not for you.,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,What if you put a Shepard tone,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,It will be awesome if you do the same but with Jerobeam Fenderson’s Oscilloscope Music!\nMaybe the patterns produced with that music can be visible with your laser-mirror system.,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"I'm pretty sure (correct me if i'm wrong) that the segmentation on the freeze frame is due to the way a laser works. it pulses a light on a tube of some crystal, the electrons absorb the energy then emit it again slowly at all the same frequency and direction. then it pulses again. so maybe there's your answer. I'm not sure though",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,This was really good. Gj,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,I made some java-script programs a few years ago to draw Lissajous figures and cycloids which look similar to some of those. Sorry that but you need a khan academy user to view them. https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/mouse-operated-spline-oscilloscope/5921753556320256,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,This was so cool. Instantly my mind jumped to string theory and what strings of vibrating energy look like.,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"Discount oscilloscope music?\\n\\nAlso, does the position of the mirror affect the shape? My hypothesis would say yes, however I don't have the resources to experiment at this moment.",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,Use oscilloscope music. I want to see if it will still create the same effect.,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,Those are Lissajous (after the mathematician who first described them)patterns. I thought they were purely theoretical being the quotient of waves. But they do appear in multidimensional membranes as seen here.,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,Put the laser and speaker in a vacuum and slowly decrease the amount of air and observe how the patterns change,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"The extra loose ends might just be the laser moving momentarily back up the path it came, but then I guess you would see it in person?",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"I'd recommend imagining them as 3D shapes, it really changes the experience.",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,You should glue 2 bits of mirror on and use 2 separate lasers to get 2 different cross sections of the same wavelengths,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,There's probably a mathematical way to play a certain frequency to make any shape you want,1,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"It would be interesting to teach an AI which sounds create which shapes, and then use it to generate a desired shape by calculating what type of waveform needs to be produced.",1,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"Try a combination of 741 Hz, 528 Hz, and 432 Hz. I wonder what kind of complex pattern that might make...",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"I think the reason why you get more than one starting point on the laser path is that the mirror turns away from the laser beam a number of times during the time the shutter is open, since the diaphragm would be vibrating at a higher frequency than the shutter of the camera, right?",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"Back in the day, a friend of mine took an old black and white tv set and used it as a basic cathode ray tube wiring the left channel of a stereo across the vertical control and the right channel across the horizontal (or something line that).  The effect was very very similar to what you have here.",0,0

C-V1uXeyGmg,You just made the language of the future,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,I'm a laser geek the reason for this pulse effect is some lasers are either pulsed or continuous pulsed causes it's to flicker,0,0

C-V1uXeyGmg,"the speaker used in this video is a UE Roll, from experience i know its a very good portable speaker :)",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,the multiple breaks is due to rolling shutter\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nP1elMR5qjc,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"This reminds me of Lissajous Patterns. It is cool how you are generating them with a single signal source. Using an oscilloscope, one must use two signals to control the x and y position of the beam. However, in your setup, the x and y position is controlled by the orientation of your mirror! Wonderful video  :3",0,0

C-V1uXeyGmg,"Does this work with music too, or just solid frequencies?",0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,shouldn't you have put the mirror in the exact middle of the balloon for most exact results?,0,0
C-V1uXeyGmg,"At ~ 5:28 when there is a short shutter speed and the contour is broken up, some parts are longer. This suggests that the speed of the laser image is changing along its path, it would be interesting to think of a way of showing this intentionally and looking if there is any further pattern to the behaviour. Perhaps intentionally strobing the laser to produce a finely dotted line to see spacing between them? Any way of changing to colour would be good, the only way I can think of is again strobing the laser but using a 'white' laser with three diodes that fire sequentially.\\n\\nAlso, I wonder how some of these patterns hold up against solving the displacement of the surface of the balloon using bessel functions etc.\\n\\nAnyway great video as always",0,0

q2KehxKQ3Zk,this would be a perfect time for a swap to renewables. transitioning while you already have a working infrastructure is hard economically but since so much of the infrastructure has been wiped out the transition cost would be minimized. this would also have the added effect of making them far more self sufficient especially as an island nation depending on imports. this could be a huge opportunity for both the Island territory and for renewable power corporations like Elon Musks' solar city. Instead of seeing this as a tragedy and wailing about it we should be rallying to help not just to repair the storm damage but repairing the islands economic stability.,0,0
q2KehxKQ3Zk,"You know what might create some jobs? Making PR the 51st state, having a massive rebuilding project including modernizing the power plants mentioned here, which likely means other infrastructure is behind the mainland too, and getting everyone on equal footing.

bY8-TUD3_Zo,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenevs Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. \\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it.

bY8-TUD3_Zo,"To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewers head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick & Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existential catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂\\nAnd yes, by the way, i DO have a Rick & Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎(COPY AND PASTED BY ME! I do not own this amazing speech of this highly intellectual viewer of the Season Rick And Morty",0,0

tp9aQXDFHbY,"So, so true. Blessed Be my furry friends. Some day we all shall meet again. I love each & every one of yr cartoon critters. U perfectly capture their essential spirit, awa their p.o.v. I particularly enjoy the it's their world, really, & we're just along for the ride, w/their permission, that is realization that comes thru when it's all said & done. We try to act all stern & head-of-household w/them, but deep down, we all know we're completely smitten & would jump thru a field of hoops for just one kitty kiss or outstretched puppy paw against our cheek. Who's really the pet, I wonder? I don't see them fawning over/cleaning up after us. I have always had a true & honest love & respect for our animal friends. They really oftentimes are more kindred to me than my own family/human companions. And they don't judge, so long as u care for them proper. I joke, but it's a win-win, really. Simon's Cat forever reminds me of this.",0,0

That's about $5.984.00 per person each year given to Puerto Rico. Fees and other taxes paid to the United States comes to about $571.00 per person annually. Where does the other $5,413.00 per person per year go? \\n\\nPuerto Rico also has what is called a Commonwealth tax. This is like state taxes in the rest of the United States. No figures are available that I could find on what they collect. But with getting $5413.00 per person in federal aid and being able to collect their own taxes where has all the money gone? \\n\\nWell most goes to its own government which employs about 25% of the population. They also own the electrical power systems. Though they do not charge government agency's for electricity. Things like Giant floodlighted stadiums, the largest water park in the Caribbean, and an ice skating rink all owned by the Puerto Rico government and paying nothing for their electricity. Could you imaging what it cost to run an ice rink in the Caribbean? Basically it is their government that is sucking them dry with payroll, expenses, and  government pensions.\\n\\nThe island has more than $72 billion of debt — nearly 100 percent of its total annual economic output — and an estimated $30 billion shortfall in its state pension fund. This is before the storms. People this did not happen over night. Their local government has done this to them for the last 75 years. When things go bad everyone like to point the finger at someone else but they need to take responsibility for this one.",0,0

And it isnt, I've said before, the main problem is really getting the power grind on in the whole island and since the estimated time to get the power on was said to be 6 months or more and the running out of fuel/diesel, people lost their minds. Imagine your country or state or county having no power for 6 months...no business open, you cant go to work (therefore you arent getting paid), no grocery stores open (no food available, only the humanitarian trucks that drop a few things off every couple of weeks will be your only source for food), no services running, etc.\\nYes there has been worse and more destruction in other countries that have lower standards of living that Puerto Rico, but its the fact that you cant leave 100% of the island with so many people at 0% for so long because that kills everything for a massive long term affects. Its one thing is parts Texas and parts florida getting hit by a hurricane and being at 50%- or even  as low as 15% for just 2 week to a month, as opposed to 100% of Puerto Rico a 0% for a minimum estimated time of 6 months.\\n\\nJust thinking about it as you as and individual. Imagine were you leave functioning at 0%, you wont be getting paid, you lost somethings maybe even your home, and then they tell you to wait minimum 6 months.... You would much rather be a Texan or a Floridian wouldnt you.\\n\\nBut There is a underlying tone in Trump when he spoke this... he made it sound like its not only that bad, but that the cry for help and US assistance is unjustified so why am I here and why are we giving them so much.",0,0

K7pQsR8WFSo,Many DLP color projectors use spinning color wheels to produce color images. By the same method you may be able to produce amazing schlieren images.

Perhaps a turntable motor would do well as they are designed with a heavy platter and bearing system to ensure stability and consistent speed.,0,0

K7pQsR8WFSo,Little warning regarding the use of your camera gear:\nI see a beautiful GH5 with an even more beautiful 100-400 Panasonic/Leica lens mounted on a tripod USING THE CAMERA TRIPOD MOUNT. It's a matter of time that the heavy 100-400 lens breaks the camera's lens mount. In general if the lens offers a separate tripod mount you should use that.

Then have someone hold their hand in front of the telescope and you will see a sharp silhouette of the hand and you can plainly see the heat coming from hand. Even someone's breath is plainly visible. This may also work with other telescopes but it I've only tried it with an old Edmund Scientific 6.  Another trick to make your imitation star is to use a shiny sphere like a Christmas tree decoration or a shiny ball bearing and shine a light at it  from an angle. The light will appear as a pinpoint on the sphere. A laser would also work on the sphere. Great video, thanks.",0,0

K7pQsR8WFSo,"Is it possble to make a stand-alone Schlieren camera using lenses instead of a parapolic mirror?

K7pQsR8WFSo,"Would it be possible to use a prism (or two) in place of the razor / color filters? That way instead of the small differences in temperature or pressure resulting in a mostly binary effect (darker/lighter, green/purple) you could hopefully see the magnitude of the pressure difference as a greater shift through the color spectrum.\\nThe helium balloon was a good example since the density put the light well within the green side, but there was nothing to really show just how far into the green filter it was.\\nIf a prism didn't work, something similar could probably be accomplished with multiple color filters very close together.",0,0

MGuUiaZWyWo,"It's weird how some edgy people think of an upside down cross as an anti-Christian symbol when it's actually a Christian one. It's predominantly used by Catholics, and it represents Saint Peter. When Saint Peter was about to be martyred by crucifixion, he requested he be crucified upside down because he felt he was unworthy to die in the same manner as Jesus, so the upside down cross is used to honor Saint Peter who is believed by Catholics to be the first Pope.",0,0

The humor is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Rick's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily fromNarodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realize that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Rick and Morty truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Rick's existencial catchphrase Wubba Lubba Dub Dub, which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Dan Harmon's genius unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Rick and Morty tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.",1,0

YqqJFqj5xQQ,"I get what he meant: that the tragedy isnt that bad. And it isnt, I've said before, the main problem is really getting the power grind on in the whole island and since the estimated time to get the power on was said to be 6 months or more and the running out of fuel/diesel, people lost their minds. Imagine your country or state or county having no power for 6 months...no business open, you cant go to work (therefore you arent getting paid), no grocery stores open (no food available, only the humanitarian trucks that drop a few things off every couple of weeks will be your only source for food), no services running, etc.\\nYes there has been worse and more destruction in other countries that have lower standards of living that Puerto Rico, but its the fact that you cant leave 100% of the island with so many people at 0% for so long because that kills everything for a massive long term affects. Its one thing is parts Texas and parts florida getting hit by a hurricane and being at 50%- or even  as low as 15% for just 2 week to a month, as opposed to 100% of Puerto Rico a 0% for a minimum estimated time of 6 months.\\n\\nJust thinking about it as you as and individual. Imagine were you leave functioning at 0%, you wont be getting paid, you lost somethings maybe even your home, and then they tell you to wait minimum 6 months.... You would much rather be a Texan or a Floridian wouldnt you.\\n\\nBut There is a underlying tone in Trump when he spoke this... he made it sound like its not only that bad, but that the cry for help and US assistance is unjustified so why am I here and why are we giving them so much.",0,0

5IG15ff4Zkk,"While I recognize, and at one time defended for other Americans the right to do as they please while wearing a military uniform, I personally can not see making a personalized political statement at the singular time that we as Americans all come together. To me, this is in essence, hijacking that moment. I would find it too polarizing to put my own agenda over the common welfare as well as suggest it more important than the public, personal, political, or moral agendas of the 300+ million Americans I share this country with. I'm also amazed that a seemingly skewed sense of proportion has been utilized in the enactment of this protest. In other words, this element as the primary issue ignores the giant elephants in the room if we are really looking to safeguard a people. \\n\\nThose early adopters that first took to sitting and now kneeling that are a party to this may now have to watch as Folks with AIDS take a knee for the injustice of so much money going into heart research. The AIDS contingent will be sharing floor space with the Asians who are fed up having universities subtract points from their test scores while adding points to others. The Asians will have to share floorspace with the PETA folks who teamed up with Sierra Club and Greenpeace to fight for animals rights. Soon enough there are now dozens of genders that may each have a cause célèbre of their own. When will the first Aussie-American decide to stand on their head for the anthem to protest the injustice taking place to the aboriginal people down under?\\n\\nEventually, plenty of folks, will purport many reasons to kneel down, squat, turn around and and even hold their breath! Some of the few left just standing are likely to remember that we once, united by our freedom hard won, stood TOGETHER quietly side by side to consider just what our country meant to us as individuals, those we lost in her defense or joined in the singing of the Anthem...But, alas, some now feel all need to recognize THEIR plight above all others! THEIR dissatisfaction above all others! THEIR angst, against all others! I couldn't do it. To me it's akin to cutting in line, demanding special accommodation despite not being the only person with special needs, spiking a punch bowl at an AA meeting, blocking traffic as an ambulance or fire engine tries to get through. In other words, it is done at others expense.\\n\\nI would find the view too egocentric to throw shade on the totality of the hopes and dreams, recollections, and prayers of the American people next to me, their collective respect for one another and their unified voice in recognition of what they feel about their little slice of America. In the end, I would be ashamed to presume and extol by virtue of the singularity of my issue and the visuals of my protest that my cause was more important than the the cause of America herself. I'd hate that people would conclude that I either had no sense of proportion or a sense of self so aggrandized, as to promote my feelings in a manner that pulls attention away from the music and reverence that is the literally the celebration of the formation and subsequent survival of our fledgling nation in its infancy and it's growth to the most significant force for freedom in the world. I never lose sight of the metaphor of the flea's fighting over a dog. Significance matters, and to portray a public matter greater or more important than the national public collective and the importance of the journey to get here is illusory\\n\\nI have to wonder if the same people that became enraged with the idea that the Black Lives Matter was the only respectful way to promote a lives matter cause and that All lives matter was selfish or misguided, follow the same line of thinking that respecting the National Anthem in the time tested manner is the only respectful way to honor our country, our soldiers, and our citizens as the symbol of our Republic is heralded jointly on a public forum, and any other display is selfish or misguided.\\n\\nIn the end, 1,264,000 men and women died to defend all that there is today and all that went before it while in a uniform of the United States Armed Forces. Dragging any cause across those hallowed graves during the collective celebration they paid for in blood is beyond crass, demonstrates the absence of class, is enacted without grace and while completely legal is in my opinion a disgrace. To defend its Constitutionality is American to the core. To defend it operationally as a technique to draw attention to a singular purpose is elegant graffiti in my opinion...On its own, it may not look outlandish but when a wider view shows it's located on the tombs of soldiers in Arlington the abhorrence of the audacity is more clear.\\n\\nAt any rate...to agree with one side or another is not as important as to abide by the social code of the day. This is what rallys the MSM and drives public emotions. That being said, calling on the precedence set by Black Lives Matter in demanding that theirs be the only message on the Lives Matter subject as it was first to the public eye and to present a different narrative than theirs should not, and can not be tolerated, I submit that the narrative of a mass majority of the free people of OUR American population needs to be heeded as well and as a respectful acknowledgement, the behavior during the National Anthem is well known with the expectations clear so as a people, lets not disrespect that as well.",0,0
5IG15ff4Zkk,"I am a UNM graduate. I am proud of my institution. I am proud of these five young men for peacefully and respectfully calling attention to quintessential American values celebrated by the anthem, but that many don't feel apply equally to them. I am proud of the young men who stood respectfully for the anthem. And I am proud of this coach representing his team and addressing this issue directly and in the spirit of conversation and understanding.",5,0
5IG15ff4Zkk,"As a sophomore here at UNM, I respect these guys no matter what, they're exercising their right to do this protest in a peaceful manner. I have no issue whatsoever with this, I stand up and put my hand over my heart, it really didn't bother me seeing those guys kneeling down at half time.",1,0
5IG15ff4Zkk,"What happened to the other video of this? I went to click on it and it says it has been deleted. \\n\\nAnyway, politics have gotten in the way of this matter. Our president is stiring the pot on this matter. Collin started this whole topic, by taking a knee for injustice with police brutality against African Americans in the US. But, our game show host, I mean President Trump turned it into something it was not. Trump is trying to get Americans to NOT stand for what they believe in. To keep the Americans following rules that don't exist. Trump is trying to make something out of nothing. It says in our first amendment that we don't have to stand for our National Anthem and we don't have to stand in front of our flag. Trump says if any NFL player takes a knee they should be taken off the field and fired. President Trump is NOT listening to the reasoning behind why Collin took the knee. \\n\\nThese kids are being criticized for making a choice in something they believe in. They keeled for the simple fact of injustice of police brutality against African Americans, just like Collin did. Okay, everyone has the right to express their beliefs. Our Lobo players said they in no way were not trying to disrespect our country and what it stands for in any shape or form. \\n\\nDoes anyone want to talk about how Air Forces WHITE cadets at the academy scrawled outside black students' doors at the U.S. Air Force Academy's preparatory school! Those AF players carried that image of the Lobo players taking a knee, they took it into a racial matter. Not the African Americans, Mexicans, Asians, or Chinese....but these white kids do this stupid a$$ sh!t and use it as an excuse to be asstards. \\n\\nAir Force players and cadets are the reason why our New Mexico Lobo players took the knee, for the injustice towards African Americans. The hate that AF cadets displayed towards the African Americans is..... appalling. But, no one wants to talk about that. \\n\\n#LOBONATION #DEM505BOYZ",1,0

I wear only a simple moisturizer and use a fun color mascara like navy, teal, purple very lightly. And that’s it. I rarely add a touch of mauve lipstick on special occasions. And now I’m retired and have time to experiment but just don’t like it on me. Natural suits me. You are very skilled and create beautiful effects.",0,0

YqqJFqj5xQQ,"I get what he meant: that the tragedy isnt that bad. And it isnt, I've said before, the main problem is really getting the power grind on in the whole island and since the estimated time to get the power on was said to be 6 months or more and the running out of fuel/diesel, people lost their minds. Imagine your country or state or county having no power for 6 months...no business open, you cant go to work (therefore you arent getting paid), no grocery stores open (no food available, only the humanitarian trucks that drop a few things off every couple of weeks will be your only source for food), no services running, etc.\\nYes there has been worse and more destruction in other countries that have lower standards of living that Puerto Rico, but its the fact that you cant leave 100% of the island with so many people at 0% for so long because that kills everything for a massive long term affects. Its one thing is parts Texas and parts florida getting hit by a hurricane and being at 50%- or even  as low as 15% for just 2 week to a month, as opposed to 100% of Puerto Rico a 0% for a minimum estimated time of 6 months.\\n\\nJust thinking about it as you as and individual. Imagine were you leave functioning at 0%, you wont be getting paid, you lost somethings maybe even your home, and then they tell you to wait minimum 6 months.... You would much rather be a Texan or a Floridian wouldnt you.\\n\\nBut There is a underlying tone in Trump when he spoke this... he made it sound like its not only that bad, but that the cry for help and US assistance is unjustified so why am I here and why are we giving them so much.",0,0

5IG15ff4Zkk,"I am a UNM graduate. I am proud of my institution. I am proud of these five young men for peacefully and respectfully calling attention to quintessential American values celebrated by the anthem, but that many don't feel apply equally to them. I am proud of the young men who stood respectfully for the anthem. And I am proud of this coach representing his team and addressing this issue directly and in the spirit of conversation and understanding.",5,0
5IG15ff4Zkk,"While I recognize, and at one time defended for other Americans the right to do as they please while wearing a military uniform, I personally can not see making a personalized political statement at the singular time that we as Americans all come together. To me, this is in essence, hijacking that moment. I would find it too polarizing to put my own agenda over the common welfare as well as suggest it more important than the public, personal, political, or moral agendas of the 300+ million Americans I share this country with. I'm also amazed that a seemingly skewed sense of proportion has been utilized in the enactment of this protest. In other words, this element as the primary issue ignores the giant elephants in the room if we are really looking to safeguard a people. \\n\\nThose early adopters that first took to sitting and now kneeling that are a party to this may now have to watch as Folks with AIDS take a knee for the injustice of so much money going into heart research. The AIDS contingent will be sharing floor space with the Asians who are fed up having universities subtract points from their test scores while adding points to others. The Asians will have to share floorspace with the PETA folks who teamed up with Sierra Club and Greenpeace to fight for animals rights. Soon enough there are now dozens of genders that may each have a cause célèbre of their own. When will the first Aussie-American decide to stand on their head for the anthem to protest the injustice taking place to the aboriginal people down under?\\n\\nEventually, plenty of folks, will purport many reasons to kneel down, squat, turn around and and even hold their breath! Some of the few left just standing are likely to remember that we once, united by our freedom hard won, stood TOGETHER quietly side by side to consider just what our country meant to us as individuals, those we lost in her defense or joined in the singing of the Anthem...But, alas, some now feel all need to recognize THEIR plight above all others! THEIR dissatisfaction above all others! THEIR angst, against all others! I couldn't do it. To me it's akin to cutting in line, demanding special accommodation despite not being the only person with special needs, spiking a punch bowl at an AA meeting, blocking traffic as an ambulance or fire engine tries to get through. In other words, it is done at others expense.\\n\\nI would find the view too egocentric to throw shade on the totality of the hopes and dreams, recollections, and prayers of the American people next to me, their collective respect for one another and their unified voice in recognition of what they feel about their little slice of America. In the end, I would be ashamed to presume and extol by virtue of the singularity of my issue and the visuals of my protest that my cause was more important than the the cause of America herself. I'd hate that people would conclude that I either had no sense of proportion or a sense of self so aggrandized, as to promote my feelings in a manner that pulls attention away from the music and reverence that is the literally the celebration of the formation and subsequent survival of our fledgling nation in its infancy and it's growth to the most significant force for freedom in the world. I never lose sight of the metaphor of the flea's fighting over a dog. Significance matters, and to portray a public matter greater or more important than the national public collective and the importance of the journey to get here is illusory\\n\\nI have to wonder if the same people that became enraged with the idea that the Black Lives Matter was the only respectful way to promote a lives matter cause and that All lives matter was selfish or misguided, follow the same line of thinking that respecting the National Anthem in the time tested manner is the only respectful way to honor our country, our soldiers, and our citizens as the symbol of our Republic is heralded jointly on a public forum, and any other display is selfish or misguided.\\n\\nIn the end, 1,264,000 men and women died to defend all that there is today and all that went before it while in a uniform of the United States Armed Forces. Dragging any cause across those hallowed graves during the collective celebration they paid for in blood is beyond crass, demonstrates the absence of class, is enacted without grace and while completely legal is in my opinion a disgrace. To defend its Constitutionality is American to the core. To defend it operationally as a technique to draw attention to a singular purpose is elegant graffiti in my opinion...On its own, it may not look outlandish but when a wider view shows it's located on the tombs of soldiers in Arlington the abhorrence of the audacity is more clear.\\n\\nAt any rate...to agree with one side or another is not as important as to abide by the social code of the day. This is what rallys the MSM and drives public emotions. That being said, calling on the precedence set by Black Lives Matter in demanding that theirs be the only message on the Lives Matter subject as it was first to the public eye and to present a different narrative than theirs should not, and can not be tolerated, I submit that the narrative of a mass majority of the free people of OUR American population needs to be heeded as well and as a respectful acknowledgement, the behavior during the National Anthem is well known with the expectations clear so as a people, lets not disrespect that as well.",0,0
5IG15ff4Zkk,"As a sophomore here at UNM, I respect these guys no matter what, they're exercising their right to do this protest in a peaceful manner. I have no issue whatsoever with this, I stand up and put my hand over my heart, it really didn't bother me seeing those guys kneeling down at half time.",1,0
5IG15ff4Zkk,"What happened to the other video of this? I went to click on it and it says it has been deleted. \\n\\nAnyway, politics have gotten in the way of this matter. Our president is stiring the pot on this matter. Collin started this whole topic, by taking a knee for injustice with police brutality against African Americans in the US. But, our game show host, I mean President Trump turned it into something it was not. Trump is trying to get Americans to NOT stand for what they believe in. To keep the Americans following rules that don't exist. Trump is trying to make something out of nothing. It says in our first amendment that we don't have to stand for our National Anthem and we don't have to stand in front of our flag. Trump says if any NFL player takes a knee they should be taken off the field and fired. President Trump is NOT listening to the reasoning behind why Collin took the knee. \\n\\nThese kids are being criticized for making a choice in something they believe in. They keeled for the simple fact of injustice of police brutality against African Americans, just like Collin did. Okay, everyone has the right to express their beliefs. Our Lobo players said they in no way were not trying to disrespect our country and what it stands for in any shape or form. \\n\\nDoes anyone want to talk about how Air Forces WHITE cadets at the academy scrawled outside black students' doors at the U.S. Air Force Academy's preparatory school! Those AF players carried that image of the Lobo players taking a knee, they took it into a racial matter. Not the African Americans, Mexicans, Asians, or Chinese....but these white kids do this stupid a$$ sh!t and use it as an excuse to be asstards. \\n\\nAir Force players and cadets are the reason why our New Mexico Lobo players took the knee, for the injustice towards African Americans. The hate that AF cadets displayed towards the African Americans is..... appalling. But, no one wants to talk about that. \\n\\n#LOBONATION #DEM505BOYZ",1,0

YqqJFqj5xQQ,"I get what he meant: that the tragedy isnt that bad. And it isnt, I've said before, the main problem is really getting the power grind on in the whole island and since the estimated time to get the power on was said to be 6 months or more and the running out of fuel/diesel, people lost their minds. Imagine your country or state or county having no power for 6 months...no business open, you cant go to work (therefore you arent getting paid), no grocery stores open (no food available, only the humanitarian trucks that drop a few things off every couple of weeks will be your only source for food), no services running, etc.\\nYes there has been worse and more destruction in other countries that have lower standards of living that Puerto Rico, but its the fact that you cant leave 100% of the island with so many people at 0% for so long because that kills everything for a massive long term affects. Its one thing is parts Texas and parts florida getting hit by a hurricane and being at 50%- or even  as low as 15% for just 2 week to a month, as opposed to 100% of Puerto Rico a 0% for a minimum estimated time of 6 months.\\n\\nJust thinking about it as you as and individual. Imagine were you leave functioning at 0%, you wont be getting paid, you lost somethings maybe even your home, and then they tell you to wait minimum 6 months.... You would much rather be a Texan or a Floridian wouldnt you.\\n\\nBut There is a underlying tone in Trump when he spoke this... he made it sound like its not only that bad, but that the cry for help and US assistance is unjustified so why am I here and why are we giving them so much.",0,0

I feel happiness when a set of intentional actions towards producing beauty outcomes in harmony and I bet millions of people feel the same nowadays... never mind the one who loves, expect, and helps to bring about chaos and disorder. They might have perverted your feeling about the truth. The psychological structure of happiness has just been posted on Youtube on 3 of October 2017. We are not here anymore and your books at school might show only the bad sides of human beings in other to replace us with robots, machines and A.I but we still can be connected if your heart warms up watching this video.

2qiBTkVRp1U,"(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\\n\\nJesus said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\\n\\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\\nbut Jesus hid himself, \\nand went out of the temple,\\n\\ngoing through the midst of them, \\nand so passed by.\\n\\n(John 8:58-59).\\n\\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\\n\\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\\n\\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(I AM):\\n\\n(Gk. ego emimi);\\n\\n*(John 6:35)<---And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst).\\n*(John 10:7)<---Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep).\\n*(John 10:14)<---I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine).\\n*(John 15:1)<---I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman).\\n*(John 18:5)<---They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\\n\\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\\n\\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\\n\\nThen answered Jesus \\nand said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \\n\\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\\nfor what things soever he doeth, \\n\\nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\\n\\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\\n\\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \\nand sheweth him all things \\nthat himself doeth:\\n\\nand he will shew him \\ngreater works than these, \\nthat ye may marvel.\\n\\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\\n\\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \\nand quickeneth them; \\neven so the Son quickeneth \\nwhom he will.\\n\\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\\n(John 5:19-21).",0,0

Z9svINZiBdU,The french do their makeup very natural. Most don't wear makeup aside from lipstick and the men don't like moisturizer because they think it feels weird on the skin. I think I prefer the French makeup look to be honest because I'm so use to seeing girls being over dramatic with their makeup. I think their skin is really even because their very pale in complexion. Similarly to dark skin blacks that have even skin because their skin is dark. Unfortunately my skin is more on the light brown side so blemishes show up and redness as well as discoloration from the sun.,0,0

Firstly, every fucking day I see your stupid ass shows, which I used to love watching the daily show and everything on comedy central every day, but now all you people do is bash other people, the other political party, trump, the south, the confederacy, portraying them as backwards and ancient. It's nothing to be proud of. It's nothing to gloat about. It shows you have no taste. You should be using your talent. You have such an amazing platform. What, are you all going to remove Monty Python and Fawlty towers from Netflix? The psycho liberals should go protest the Netflix building. It's all about what is meme=ing right now. It's statues this week. Then what? books? The Netflix shows? I live in California now. You have no fucking clue what the south is like. You're not from there. We are actually biologically different from the African American, and that makes no one racist. I never have understood what racism actually is. I simply did what was best, and hung out with who I should hang out with and studied when I needed to study. And it never included hiring, hanging out with african americans or other cultures. All the leftists do is try to force everyone to be a big happy gross family. It is painful to try to act like someone I'm not!!! I am nice and cordial to everyone no matter what. Segregation is important because it allows cultures to develop and progress further along without having to lie to yourself... I hate hanging out with African Americans and any other race usually. Their culture is so different. And then people call me a racist... why? African Americans have no issue creating all black events... Why? The fact that the leftists of California force multiculturalism on everyone and name-call if you don't believe what they believe... and at the same time harbor illegal immigrants, which is essentially legal (sorry I mean illegal) slavery... is hypocrisy. You have nothing better to do than to make fun of the south, shit on them and try to make them all out to be rednecks and backwards? This material is so low brow. Plz use talent.

But the south started revolting so lincoln began moving troops into Fort Sumpter which the south saw as an act of war sparking the Civil War. The Confederacy werent people fighting to keep their slaves they were fighting for fair laws on taxation. Lincoln only added only added the banning of having slaves (only in the south, the yankees could keep their slaves untill he later added another law banning all ownership of african americans) to accomodate the slaves that were following the union armies beging to follow them since they had no where else to go",0,0

I am he who sent her, using my deceitful speech, to\\ndeceive you, until you both ate of the fruit of the tree and abandoned the command of YAHUAH. \\n3 But when Adam heard these words from him, he said to him, Can you make me a garden as YAHUAH made for\\nme? Or can you clothe me in the same bright nature in which YAHUAH had clothed me? \\n4 Where is the divine nature you promised to give me? Where is that slick speech of yours that you had with\\nus at first, when we were in the garden? \\n5 Then Satan said to Adam, Do you think that when I have promised one something that I would actually\\ndeliver it to him or fulfil my word? Of course not. For I myself have never even thought of obtaining what I\\npromised. \\n6 Therefore I fell, and I made you fall by that for which I myself fell; and with you also, whosoever accepts my counsel, falls thereby. \\n\\n7 But now, O Adam, because you fell you are under my rule, and I am king over you; because you have\\nobeyed me and have transgressed against your ALUAH. Neither will there be any deliverance from my hands\\nuntil the day promised you by your ALUAH. \\n8 Again he said, Because we do not know the day agreed on with you by your ALUAH, nor the hour in which\\nyou shall be delivered, for that reason we will multiply war and murder on you and your descendants after\\nyou. \\n9 This is our will and our good pleasure, that we may not leave one of the sons of men to inherit our orders in\\nheaven. \\n10 For as to our home, O Adam, it is in burning fire; and we will not stop our evil doing, not,  one day nor\\none hour. And I, O Adam, shall put you on fire when you come into the cave to live there. \\n11 When Adam heard these words he cried and mourned, and said to Eve, Hear what he said; that he won't\\nfulfil any of what he told you in the garden. Did he really then become king over us? \\n12 But we will ask YAHUAH, who created us, to deliver us out of his hands. \\n\\nBook of Adam of Eve\\nChapter XLV Why Satan didn't fulfil his promises. \\n\\n\\n1 Then Adam rose and prayed to YAHUAH, saying, See, this fire has separated us from the cave in which You\\nhave commanded us to live; but now, behold, we cannot go into it. \\n2 Then YAHUAH heard Adam, and sent him His Word, that said: −− \\n3 O Adam, see this fire! How different the flame and heat thereof are from the garden of delights and the\\ngood things in it! \\n4 When you were under My control, all creatures yielded to you; but after you have transgressed My\\ncommandment, they all rise over you. \\n5 YAHUAH said again to him, See, O Adam, how Satan has decieved you! He has deprived you of an exalted state, and has not kept his word to you; but has, after all, become your enemy. He is\\nthe one who made this fire in which he meant to burn you and Eve. \\n6 Why, O Adam, has he not kept his agreement with you, not even one day; but has deprived you of the esteem\\nthat was on you −− when you yielded to his command? \\n7 Do you think, Adam, that he loved you when he made this agreement with you? Or that he loved you and\\nwished to raise you on high? \\n8 But no, Adam, he did not do all that out of love to you; but he wished to make you come out of light into\\ndarkness; and from an exalted state to degradation; from esteem to abasement; from joy to sorrow; and from\\nrest to fasting and fainting. \\n9 YAHUAH also said to Adam, See this fire kindled by Satan around your cave; see this wonder that surrounds\\nyou; and know that it will encompass about both you and your descendants, when you obey his command;\\nthat he will plague you with fire; and that you will go down into Ghenna after you are dead. \\n10 Then you will see the burning of his fire, that will be burning around you and likewise your descendants.\\nYou will not be delivered from it until My coming; just like you cannot go into your cave right now because\\nof the great fire around it; not until My Word comes and makes a way for you on the day My covenant is\\nfulfilled. \\n11 There is no way for you at present to come from this life to rest, not until My Word comes, who is My\\nWord(YAHUAH MASHYACH). Then He will make a way for you, and you shall have rest. Then YAHUAH called with His Word to the fire\\nthat burned around the cave, that it split itself in half, until Adam had gone through it. Then the fire parted\\nitself by YAHUAH'S order, and a way was made for Adam*. \\n12 And YAHUAH withdrew His Word from Adam.",0,0

The North had a lot of industry while the South had a lot of farming, for example, so it created cultures that valued different things and felt different things were important and this caused a lot of disagreements.

Is there even any slavery in existence now? To my knowledge there isn't. You can't ignore what has happened in the past and nobody should dwell and or be offended by these things. Such a sensitive bunch of crying babies ppl are now even though nobody alive really has been a slave owner or slave themselves.

J5b_-TZwQ0I,"Ok if you want to get some TRUE history then feel free to read this. I don't want to start any conflict, I just want to give you some knowledge and understanding about the confederacy the south and the union the north. And if anyone who has ever read a true history book, unlike this guy (not trying to be rude but it just seems like he hasn't), should know these true facts. Ok so during the civil war times the confederacy, which was the south, was democratic where the union, which was the north, was republican. Ok good you got that great. As we should all know the main conflict of the civil war was on slavery. So, taking that information I gave you earlier that you should know by now that the democrats, the confederacy, (YES) was for salvery and the republicans, the union, was against salvery. Did I just blow your mind with the truth, well if it helped you learn something I hope it did. So understand this, when the men went to fight for the confederacy it could either mean that they were actually for salvery or they were fighting for their home state that just so happened to be in the South even though they might not agree with salvery but they did want to betray their state by not fighting for the south. And the same somewhat goes for the north, except they were against slavery not for it, but pretty much every body on the union was against salvery that fought. Now thankfully the Union won so therefore salvery is illegal. Alright, something else when he talks about the confederate monuments and statues and them needing to be taken down, guess who wanted them up in the first place? If you said the Democratic Party you are right but he probably thought it was the Republican Party. When he talks about the confederate arm, saying something like I can't believe it they were the enemy they killed American soldiers, it made it sound as if they weren't even Americans, but they are they are the south, the confederacy, the democrats side that made up the U.S.. Also when he talks about the KKK, um well yeah about that, the people who started that were democrats as well which again he probably thought he was talking about the republicans. Ok, So I'm guessing this guy, John Oliver, is a democratic, now if he is going to be for this particular party he should understand all the stuff he stupidly said, and he is English (not trying to be racist, I'm English too) so he doesn't know to much about U.S.A. History (but that shouldn't stop him from learning about it), which if he is going to speak about U.S.A. History he should definitely do some better researchers and especially on the party he is for before he makes himself look like a bigger fool along with his party. Now look, now of days Americans really don't know to much about their country's history and this is a problem. This leads to all these different riots going on, people doing wrong things, and other things that are completely stupid. If people would take time to learn from our history, instead of saying we don't need it, we the Americans could probably live better and the U.S. would really just be better, so I do encourage you to study your U.S. History. Hopefully you might have learned somethings from this and that it makes you want to learn more about and get even more details in better depth and wording about what I said. Sorry for any misspellings or odd wording and I could have made my point and everything else I said more clear but it's kinda hard to get your point across from text, but I hope you did learn something and thank you for reading to the end.",0,0

I grew up in the Atlanta area as did many generations of my family where we honor the confederate generals, battles, and worship Gone With the Wind.  This starts from the day you are born.  We are not a racist family and never ever have I felt that I was becoming racist as a result of honoring these people.  We take pride in these things and identify with them.  So, how do we identify?  Loyalty, honor, commitment.  This is the part where typed words don't really do justice.  Unless you and your family were raised here, I don't think you can fully understand.  Never ever have I thought of slavery in a positive light while honoring these things.  We take pride in being Southern identifying with the good NOT the bad.  And this feels like an attack on Southern heritage which is just very saddening to me.",0,1

2qiBTkVRp1U,"(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\\n\\nJesus said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\\n\\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\\nbut Jesus hid himself, \\nand went out of the temple,\\n\\ngoing through the midst of them, \\nand so passed by.\\n\\n(John 8:58-59).\\n\\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\\n\\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\\n\\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(I AM):\\n\\n(Gk. ego emimi);\\n\\n*(John 6:35)<---And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst).\\n*(John 10:7)<---Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep).\\n*(John 10:14)<---I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine).\\n*(John 15:1)<---I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman).\\n*(John 18:5)<---They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\\n\\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\\n\\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\\n\\nThen answered Jesus \\nand said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \\n\\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\\nfor what things soever he doeth, \\n\\nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\\n\\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\\n\\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \\nand sheweth him all things \\nthat himself doeth:\\n\\nand he will shew him \\ngreater works than these, \\nthat ye may marvel.\\n\\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\\n\\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \\nand quickeneth them; \\neven so the Son quickeneth \\nwhom he will.\\n\\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\\n(John 5:19-21).",0,0

I'd like to point out though, that as a child, I went to this show with my family. I loved watching the horses, the food was good, and it was very fun. I hadn't learned much about the civil war at that point, so I asked my mother about the uniforms. She told me everything about how the south rebelled in order to own slaves, and she explained all of the terrible things that happened.\\n\\nLooking back on it, I realize how an outsider might see glorification of the confederacy, but it's not true at all. Yes it displays confederate and union soldiers, and it pits them against each other in friendly competition. Could people petition or protest in order to change this aspect of it? By all means, go ahead. Recently, however, there have been whispers of people wanting the place shut down all together. I think that these people should come to the very city in which the [original] show resides. Pigeon Forge is full of poverty. There are countless families who have trouble keeping lights turned on or keep water running. It's gotten even worse after the recent forest fires. A lot of families were displaced.

It's no wonder the punishment for being a deserter was so severe. It had to be. None of these men were passionate about this cause, and only a small amount of critical thought would lead you to telling the army to fuck right off.

J5b_-TZwQ0I,This genuinely pisses me off let's talk about why the civil war was actually fought right off the bat i have the word civil in quotes because it wasn't a civil war a civil war is a war fought between the same country the Confederate states of America (CSA) and the united states of America (USA) were not the same country that's just crystal fucking clear the  southern states succeed for what ever reason that does not mater here.\nFast forward and there was a lot of tension between the country's  the CSA got a message the USA were going to fire upon a base under CSA control so CSA decided to instead take a beating like a bitch fire upon a USA base after learning the message was not true sent from the north the CSA rose the white flag and formally said hay we fucked up. \nAbraham Lincoln who was in office at the time and he wanted the war because he was a power hungry twat pumpkin.\nNow this is were the war actually started Abraham Lincoln did not accept the apology because he is i as stated before in the previous sentence he was a power hungry twat pumpkin so he launched an attack on a CSA base and the war progressed from there.\nSo the war was not about slavery and not about states rights it was because Abraham Fucktwat the power hungry top hat warring shit stain on a wall wanted more power and more slaves  I think this is a good time to mention only less than 3% of the south owned slaves that number was *MUCH* HIGHER UP NORTH! Abraham Fucktwat would have gladly put every last black man in shackles because he wanted power more then anything.\nRobert E Lee on the other hand inherited slaves from his father do you know what he did with them?\nGuess the fuck what he let them go he set them free so now instead of honoring him for the good that he did people spit on his name in disgust because there to stupid to some fucking research or go to the boviour house in Mississippi so did you learn something today I hope so.,0,0

He was claiming to be, God Himself.\\n\\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\\n\\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(I AM):\\n\\n(Gk. ego emimi);\\n\\n*(John 6:35)<---And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst).\\n*(John 10:7)<---Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep).\\n*(John 10:14)<---I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine).\\n*(John 15:1)<---I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman).\\n*(John 18:5)<---They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\\n\\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\\n\\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\\n\\nThen answered Jesus \\nand said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \\n\\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\\nfor what things soever he doeth, \\n\\nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\\n\\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\\n\\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \\nand sheweth him all things \\nthat himself doeth:\\n\\nand he will shew him \\ngreater works than these, \\nthat ye may marvel.\\n\\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\\n\\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \\nand quickeneth them; \\neven so the Son quickeneth \\nwhom he will.\\n\\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\\n(John 5:19-21).",0,0

j6cv-6WuDK0,"Thank you Seth!  We need EVERYONE with a public forum and a following to join Eninem on this topic and draw a line in the sand and we need our members of Congress to make a decision about whether their loyalty is to Donald Trump. the Republican party or the CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES!\\n\\nSenator Grassley says he doesn't see how it is productive to talk about the problems with the President and says, cool it.  Oh yes, Senator Grassley, let's just bury our collective heads in the sand and pretend that Donald Trump isn't trying to dismantle our democracy as long as you can get the tax cuts for your rich donors and rich friends!  Right now, Donald Trump is the MOST DANGEROUS person in the world and could very easily start World War III and /or begin a civil war in this country with his continued divisiveness.  \\n\\nYou can't just get on with business as if everything is normal and routine because it isn't!  Donald Trump and Paul Manafort have both publicly stated they want to drain the swamp by dismantling the government as we have known it for more than 200 years but you say, cool it.  \\n\\nWhat is happening in our government today is unprecedented and historic and will become a permanent part of history.  Senator Grassley, I ask you, which side of history do you want your name to be associated?  Do you want your name to be associated with the group of members of Congress who recognized the dangers Donald Trump and company presents to both the democracy of the United States and to the world at large and had the courage to act to save the United States of America or do you want to be remembered as a Senator who said cool it, pretended it is business as usual, as a faction of anti-democracy, anti-democratic people used social media, conventional media and assistance from Russia to destroy our government from the inside out as long as you and your fellow members of Congress can gain personally?\\n\\nDonald Trump is dangerous!  Any President who would label the media as fake news  so as to undermine the core values of our first amendment to the Constitution is very dangerous indeed!  There is a huge difference between disagreeing with the media and labeling the media as fake news.  The fake news label is designed to discredit the free press so that the only message the American people hear and eventually come to believe is the message of Donald Trump and company or should I say the message that Russia wants to convince the American people is correct.  Senator Grassley, these are dangerous times and the democracy and the country, we the American people love, is on the verge of collapse if you and your fellow members of Congress continue to pretend it is business as usual and DO NOTHING!\\n\\nSome of the first things Donald Trump did as President was to push the fake news narrative, attempt to discredit our intelligence agencies in the eyes of the American people so the people would lose faith in those agencies and choose to disregard the findings of the intelligence agencies, bring the far right faction of Breitbart into the inner circle of the White House, discredit our court system and attack judges who followed the Constitution and who ruled against the anti-constitutional policies of Donald Trump, tried to quietly dismantle the Congressional Ethics Committee on day one of his presidency, dismantled the State department, and fired anyone with integrity who was perceived as a challenge to his political agenda, whatever that is.  Those moves were very calculated and designed to take control of our government much like Hitler took control of Germany or Putin took control of Russia.  \\n\\nThose who fail to learn from history are destined to repeat history! \\n\\nSenator Grassley, the oath of office you and every member of Congress took is to the Constitution of the United States and not to the President or to the Republican party!\\n\\nSenator Grassley, the time has come to STOP focusing on business as usual and FOCUS on fixing the extremely serious problem of a President who is trying to dismantle our Constitution and destroy the country we love!  \\n\\nSenator Grassley, which side of history will your name be associated?",0,0

I remember I asked once which state's rights were they fighting over other than slavery then?. I don't think I got an answer. I mean at first in like 5th grade for me in Texas, I remember history class being pretty open all things considered. The teacher always claimed she was old but would never say how old. She actually told us that she was taught about Native Americans differently than us. To me, it seems we just change history to the benefit of the white man's agenda. I know I sound crazy saying that but it's true. We used to be taught that all Native Americans were savages and we were somehow the good guys.

Confederate Guerrillas attacked trains regularly in order to rob the passengers of valuables.  Civilian death became so common on the Chattanooga railroad the entire 53 Ohio infantry was sent away from the war effort to escort the trains. 21 confederate sympathizers attempted to burn down a peaceful community in Vermont (St. Albans) and then escape to Canada.  They collaborated with Booth to assassinate an American president and were responsible for numerous massacres like Centralia, Fort Pillow, Baxter Springs, Gainesville, Poison Spring, Shelton Laurel, and Saltville.  The post civil war was when all subterfuge disappeared and former confederates became bonafide terrorists--responsible for tens of thousands of deaths.(an estimated 4,000 lynchings and many thousands more murders during the violent years of reconstruction).  They were just as pathetic, cowardly and vile as isis.",0,0

J5b_-TZwQ0I,"Aaaaaand you make the same mistake.  The same mistake as everybody else.\\n\\nThe Confederacy and most of the politicians therein were undoubtedly concerned with slavery and had it enshrined in its proposed laws.\\n\\nThe Civil War was in no way about slavery.  It was sort of tangentially related to slavery, but in that regard it's not dissimilar from any other political event in the first century of the nation.  The Civil War was directly about settling a bet.  The Confederate states contended that they had the right to leave the United States whenever they felt like it if their population so elected.  The Federal Government disagreed.  That disagreement quickly became impolite.  Abolition was certainly an undercurrent - no doubt about that - but it legitimately, one hundred percent was not the principal issue being settled.  That's why Lincoln tried to use the Emancipation Proclamation as a threat.  He tried to get all of the Confederate states to stop all this secession business or else he would actually do the thing they were all so afraid of him doing.  If they had immediately surrendered, slavery would not have ended (not then, anyway - there were economic drivers that would probably have rendered slavery a fundamentally unsustainable method of staffing within fifty years or so).\\n\\nThis misunderstanding is just infuriating, as is the notion that all Confederate soldiers were somehow traitors.  That's like suggesting all those people in Catalonia are traitors to Spain.  No they weren't - they were doing what they honestly believed they had a right to do and there kind of wasn't anything to specifically tell them they were wrong.  That is, after all, why we threw that whole war thing - because there wasn't a clear answer anywhere in history or law.  Turns out they were incorrect in that conclusion.  Even from the Union's position, however, all of those people were still United States citizens.  If they weren't, the Federal government wouldn't have had a whole lot of cause to, you know, go military the Confederacy - not any more than it would have had a reason to military Japan, anyway.  Those are all citizens.  With very few exceptions that was even formalized.  So for chrissakes stop it already.  You're trying to talk to people who identify with this history.  Telling them that being proud of their ancestors requires hating the country they live in is not going to help your case.  I get that it's fun to seize what you think is the moral high ground, but any cognitive psychologist will tell you that this is easily the worst of all possible ways to defuse the disagreement.\\n\\nDown on the Confederacy?  Sure.  That government was a hive of assholes and clowns with odious moral opinions and the practical talent for government you'd find in a putrid mandrill carcass.  But don't try to characterize the Civil War itself as just being about slavery.  That's just not what it was.\\n\\nSimilarly, you're kind of mischaracterizing the question of states' rights.  The Southern states' position was actually pretty consistent.  Basically, they didn't like other states making laws affecting the life or property of their citizens.  As gross as it is to think about, that kind of includes slaves.  That's what the fugitive slave law was about.  Imagine that Oregon passed a law that said that any dog that crossed its border was immediately emancipated from its owner and the owner was not allowed to come get it back.  That's basically how this looked to them.  You can certainly disagree with their interpretation - it's a lot easier to do that these days, since the notion of a strong Federal government has been pretty much cemented into the American consciousness to a much greater extent than it had been in the first hundred years of the nation's history - but it wasn't inconsistent.  They weren't only in favor of the right states' rights in a policy sense.  That's not to say that they wouldn't maybe try some of their own bullshit with anybody they could convince themselves might be a slave who happened to visit them, but none of the ways you talk about in the video are inconsistent with the position they held to.\\n\\nAs for statues...I tend to agree.  There should probably be a few, just like there should be a few monuments here in Texas for the...just terrible people who were involved in Texas independence, but there shouldn't be even a quarter as many as there are now.  They're gross and uninviting and a stupid idea, because you WANT people to come to your cities, so making some stuff that a substantial subset of that population will read as a big metal middle finger is just the pinnacle of dumb.  Most of them should be replaced with the more apropos examples that you give in the episode and then some.  A couple, though, on memorial paths - I have a hard time finding fault with that.  And for crying out loud...military bases?  Really?  One of the groups you tend to name those things after are good fighting guys, and there were good fighting guys in the Confederacy.  Let's not pull a muscle overreaching.",0,0

If you erase them you erase HISTORICAL PROOFS and that's not good, because one day in the future someone could teach you whatever he wants, but if you have proofs you can see, that changes. Also statues last more than papers! I don't say keep them where they are, no, they are painful for black people, I just say put them in a museum and show your children how bad the south was. Would you be fine if 1000 years from now, people will say that white supremacist didn't exist because they don't have proofs (even because the statues last more than any other proof)?

It doesn't look good when a clan member defends this statue...\\nI still think people should remember the good and the bad.

And I remember when I was in third grade, I learned here in Texas that the Civil War was all about slavery. Literally two years later, when taking US history for the umpteenth time (we repeat shit a lot here) it had changed to being about states' rights. \\n\\nThis change happened under the Sec of Edu, a man with zero education background, who was just a freaking dentist, who ran under the auspices of saving Texas children from the liberal and Democrat indoctrination of our children through our education system. He literally wanted to change the history of our country to indoctrinate kids towards conservative and Republican ideologies instead. This is literally what he ran on, and because of that, he won. And subsequently destroyed so much of Texas's already piss poor education system, particularly in the areas of history and science.",0,0

J5b_-TZwQ0I,"No, the American Civil War was not mainly about slavery, only also about it. It was the casus belli. Like the invasion of Polonia for WW2, or the dead of the Franz Ferdinand for the WW1.

I will grant you that the South was decisively pro slaves. But the North was by no means anti slave. Abraham Lincoln wanted the country to stay together, he wasn't fighting to free slaves. And the Emancipation Proclamation only freed slaves in the south. Slaves in Maryland were not freed by it. Why did that not come up.

He was claiming to be, God Himself.\\n\\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\\n\\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(I AM):\\n\\n(Gk. ego emimi);\\n\\n*(John 6:35)<---And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst).\\n*(John 10:7)<---Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep).\\n*(John 10:14)<---I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine).\\n*(John 15:1)<---I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman).\\n*(John 18:5)<---They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\\n\\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\\n\\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\\n\\nThen answered Jesus \\nand said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \\n\\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\\nfor what things soever he doeth, \\n\\nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\\n\\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\\n\\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \\nand sheweth him all things \\nthat himself doeth:\\n\\nand he will shew him \\ngreater works than these, \\nthat ye may marvel.\\n\\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\\n\\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \\nand quickeneth them; \\neven so the Son quickeneth \\nwhom he will.\\n\\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\\n(John 5:19-21).",0,0

j6cv-6WuDK0,"You know, part of the pride of comparing left wing stars like Colbert, Meyers, Bee, Oliver, Noah was that unlike their right wing counterparts, they usually keep 99% of their insults and focus on Donald Trump and leave his supporters alone. Very unlike Right wing stars who are low enough to not be satisfied with attacking Leftist politicians, but attacking Leftist voters. Unfortunately, Seth Meyers is simply not trustworthy like Jon Stewart to hold the mantle of a resistor of Donald Trump if he's going to go down this rabbit hole, regardless of how stupid or flippant you think his supporters are, do you have any idea how many African Americans STILL think OJ simpson was innocent? It's not an excuse, but as leftists, we are not in the same realm of poison as people like Milo, Tomi Lahren, Info Wars, etc. who constantly spread hatred against Clinton Voters, that's what made Meyers and Colbert better than those guys because they refuse to attack Trump voters. Unfortunately, if this is the path Meyers is gonna go down, then I probably won't be watching stuff like this anymore.",0,0

The next day they dont wake me up at all. \nThe third day they were apparently building toward i get my blood \npressure taken after being up all night its about 150/120 the bottom \nnumber was at least 120 i would rather low ball it than mislead you she \nsays let me take it with another arm band and she uses another one \nimmediately after and the bottom number drops to for sure 104 meaning a \n16 difference what kind of program are they running \nhere i dont know how much of the \ntechnology their coming out with or plan to but in ark i thought they \ncould put video in my head i believe i was wrong i think they can put \nyour active thinking into overdrive and activate parts of the brain that\n trigger thoughts but recently they really did develop a way to put \nvideo in possibly a refined way of the first development but imagine \ntheyre putting all this in and there are people reading it out and you \ncant do anything about it they got mad i got running shoes the one thing\n they helped me with like 30 or 40 dollar sauconys at dicks tent and my \nmom started trying to pull me toward another reality and i said im not \nplaying this game anymore and decided to wait around to get over seas to\n confront this head on and they brought the fight to me with the video \nafter i found out about the mind reader through comms in ark and i was \ngetting uncharacteristic thoughts being read out as my own and then \nafter colorado it hits again this isnt a blue shell this is a \ndeclaration of war on me by terrorists and now i have ptsd possibly even\n if they finally quit actively doing all this but they were telling \npeople oh you broke him with your words and connections of dots you made\n when in reality it was them and now im scared because i have no \nreassurance they are not doing it anymore because you would think there \nwere more lying or incorrect experts saying it wasnt done both times but\n you wouldnt watch someone react to ptsd and say theyre overreacting so \nthey must have overreacted to whatever it was they say caused it because\n that would make you an idiot my first three committals i had high blood\n pressure over 90% of the time and in minn i had high blood pressure \nonce and i knew the night before because my blood pressure really was\n high from being drugged by a piece of gum and a nurse even commented on\n me walking that night and said i wonder what youre blood pressure is \nlike now or something so by me walking only she supposedly could tell \nthe one time i had high blood pressure and sure enough i barely slept \nthat night and woke up to be told i had high blood pressure after hours i\n got it taken again and it was fine because i felt it return to normal.\n You would think experts checked the equipment my first three committals\n and either they lied or theyre incompotent at their jobs ask them which\n im curious,0,0

It's quite fascinating and enlightening, and opens an enormous sliding glass door view into history that was never taught to us before now about the economics of slavery, the politics of the north and the south during the time of the Civil War, and should be required reading for every child in America going forward if we really care about educating our kids about our country's real history.  It's thorough, authentic, referenced,... it's everything a work comprised of fact-finding, statistics, and oral histories, is supposed to be.

As *soon* as the US became independent from the UK, it immediately began oppressing its own citizens (Whiskey Rebellion).\\n\\nThe Civil War was fought for a terrible reason (slavery), but also for a good reason (overthrowing a repressive government-- which is the most American thing you can possibly do).\\n\\nHaving said all that, I'm glad the south lost because of why they rebelled, but I also think they were close to half right.

Finally (this has nothing to do with statues, which clearly have outlived any usefulness), military commanders throughout history (Rommel, Hannibal) have been afforded respect by their counterpart peers so let us respect peer review, as such, before we judge individuals too harshly.

J5b_-TZwQ0I,"I have lived in the Deep South for nearly 12 years now, and I believe I have it figured out. So, everyone knows the phrase the poor man fights the rich man's war. The rich were able to escape fighting in the war. They introduced the draft into America in 1862, forcing all men between the ages of 18 and 35 liable for a three-year term of service in the PACS. It also extended the terms of enlistment for all one-year soldiers to three years. Men employed in certain occupations considered to be most valuable for the home front (such as railroad and river workers, civil officials, telegraph operators, miners, druggists and teachers) were exempt from the draft.[14] The act was amended twice in 1862. On September 27, the maximum age of conscription was extended to 45.[15] On October 11, the Confederate Congress passed the so-called Twenty Negro Law,[16] which exempted anyone who owned 20 or more slaves... In February 1864, the age limits were extended to between 17 and 50. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_Army#Control_and_conscription \\nAlthough this created rifts between the lower and upper classes, the penalties for desertion were almost always execution, sometimes including a soldier's entire family. In order to inspire and command loyalty, the Confederate Congress had to use propaganda tactics much like today. They made it about economics, religion, state-independence, state-pride, white-man-pride, etc. There were no doubt many Confederate soldiers who truly believed they were fighting to save their states, especially after they saw the economic devastation that hit the Deep South after the war. I mean, think about it, most Trump voters fell for the con, plain and simple. The Confederate soldiers didn't have internet and access to reality outside of their own small world, but at least most of Trumpsters do. But in rural, deep red states like Mississippi, as late as 2015, studies show that only 40% of rural residents had access to internet service. http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/2015/10/12/broadband-expansion-mississippi-connect-america-fcc-att-windstream-frontier-communications/73808912/ \\nIn a town with only four stop lights, you have a community that has largely remained closed from outside influences until the past few decades. We are all products of our raising and our environments. In most of the communities, true desegregation has only begun in the past few decades as well. So, generation after generation, closed communities such as these have not yet fully discovered what the internet can provide for themselves. Even the youngest generations cling to their families' rhetoric, because they know they will be shunned if they break away from the collective consensus held by each racial group. There are some freethinkers and pioneers, but it will likely take another generation or two until these areas step into the modern age. These are areas where grandparents mostly rode horses and buggies for transportation. Many of these people cling to a fiction of their history. They have no idea what the truth is, what reality is. The poor-to-rich ratio in areas like this is extremely disproportionate. The poor have been controlled by the rich for so long that when a rich man tells them they have been forgotten by the government and he's going to fix all their problems, they believe him. Trump has utilized their plight and ignorance to fund and fuel his campaign and administration. He is a sick man. Does he know he's tearing apart families? mind-controlling his followers? robbing his donors? Of course he does, but his victims don't. I know it is difficult, trust me. I have had to largely distance myself from my father and my uncle because they refuse to even acknowledge that they might be wrong. I've done nothing to change his opinion, but I know attacks and challenges won't work for those under a spell. We have to be creative and compassionate in our discussions with these blind followers. We must give them the tools to show themselves, but we can only do that if we understand that they are victims of mind rape. It is an epidemic that most don't even know is an epidemic. But of course we must also remember that there are the mind-controlled and the MIND-CONTROLLERS aka Trolls. These must be exposed, so that others will not fall prey. Peace and love to All.",0,0

That was just what happend back then because if someone was against the system, it was very likely you end up dead or in KZ. So we have to accept what happend.

I don't know much about history and can't provide any context or explanation, but I feel like this video should have at least tried to address these points.

J5b_-TZwQ0I,"I grew up in Texas and New Mexico. My teachings were that the Civil War itself was started because of the recession of the Confederate states...who seceded because Lincoln was elected and intended to do away with slavery. So saying the Civil War wasn't about slavery is like saying a drunk driver didn't have an accident because they were drunk, they had an accident because they didn't hit the brakes in time. The emphasis that most of my history classes put on the Civil War? It was a horrific and devastating time for everyone involved and there were a lot of instances where families were split, with some fighting in opposing armies. Some people had very conflicting issues like whether they agreed with the abolishing of slavery and would fight to support that, or if they were going to remain loyal to their families. There were some who only knew the people they had grown up with in the southern states and to take up arms against them was inconceivable. \\n\\nBut the war itself was all about slavery.

It is impossible not to live a life that could lead a descendant of yours to one day say, 'a guy smashed grandpappy's head in with a garden hoe? That's amazing! Great job that guy!' It is inevitable that if you go far enough down the timeline you will reach a point where something that today you consider completely normal and natural will be looked upon as unforgivably evil. Human society is dynamic, it changes over time. And as it changes it's values change. Now that's not to say that morality is relative. But just as human technology and scientific understanding tends to advance and improve over time, so too does human philosophy and moral/ethical understanding tend to advance and improve over time. Anderson Cooper's ancestor could no more conceive of the idea of a 64-bit computer than he could of the notion that owning a black slave was wrong. Does a person really deserve to die for ignorance?

What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union.

Lincoln had only limited support for his war in the North or among the upper classes in England and France. Lincoln proposed to issue the Emancipation Proclamation as a means of increased that support by advancing a cause more worthy than the suppression of a rival  government. He did so after the indecisive victory at Antietam. even though he himself was dubious about its legality and it did increase support overseas among the ordinary people.

It is possible that we might know a little bit more about our history than he does.  98% of Confederate soldiers didn't own slaves.  Perhaps they fought for the same reason that I'd like to knock John Oliver's block off or the reason the Irish fought the British; they didn't want some outsider invading their home and throwing their weight around, and that was happening in 1861.\\n\\nA little context might actually help.  Yes, slavery was the driving force that led to the Civil War, but it was hardly the proximate cause of its outbreak.  Its force began brewing from the time our founders refused to deal with it in our Constitution, despite consensus that slavery was an evil that contradicted our founding tenets.  Slavery was legal in all 13 colonies and remained so in all the states after the Revolution.  In fairness, it was also legal in Spain, Holland, France, England, and modern day Italy, as well as wide swaths of every other continent as it had been for about 5,000 years.  However, it was trade policy and tariffs that protected our manufacturing sector--we imported heavily from Europe--at the expense of cotton exports.  This was a regional economic struggle from the early 1800s.  \\n\\nThe abolition of slavery was not proposed in Congress until after the war, and slavery was legal in 4 Union states until 1865.  Emancipation was not announced until 2 years after the war started and it was a very divisive issue on the Union side at the time.  As I mentioned before, hardly any Confederate soldiers were slaveholders.  Certainly there was more abolitionist sentiment in the North than in the South, but it is not as if the Civil War in 1861 was some army of abolitionists against an army of slaveholders.\\n\\nAs Southerners, the Civil War is a big deal to us because it happened on our soil and almost all of our people fought in it.  Farms were destroyed and houses burned in my rural town.  As kids, our grandfathers told us stories that their grandfathers told them about fighting in the war.\\n\\nThe Civil War was a necessary of American history.  It eradicated a great evil and It made us the unified nation we are today.  Even though I identify with the boys in gray and I love hearing stories about Lee and Jackson, I thank God that the South lost.  But despite what these brave grandstanders like John Oliver say, the Civil War was not Abolitionist Northerners vs Slave-holding Southerners; the Confederacy was not some lone symbol of slavery in the vast history of civilization; Robert E. Lee is not remotely analogous to Hitler; and I don't have to be pro-slavery to be proud of my Southern heritage.  \\n\\nAnd if John Oliver doesn't like it, he can kiss my Rebel Ass!",0,1
J5b_-TZwQ0I,"Confederate soldiers were Americans to. It sounds to me you need a history lesson. The war was started because Democrats did not like who was elected as president. The slavery issue was not addressed until after the battle of Antietam. Lincoln said he would of left the South with their way of life but slavery was not moving to New states. So the war was not started with slavery. You can't change history you can only learn from it, and if history offends you then you have mental issues. The liberals don't like who was elected president and they are trying to erase history. Sound familiar? If you have ever been to the South you will know the people are a bit different.

J5b_-TZwQ0I,"Can I just remind everyone that the civil war was not solely fought over slavery? Decades before the war actually happened were there tensions between the North and the South that had nothing to do with slavery. For example, the different economic interests the North and South had. the North was developing off of industrialization while the South stuck with agriculture. With the benefits that the North got from industrialization were they able to develop superior technology, like transportation. Most of the railroads were either in the North, or headed west; not south. It was also during Andrew Jackson's term did he and South Carolina experience many complications that had to do with taxation. The south was getting the short end of the stick in more than just areas of slavery. To solve this, they created their own confederation, and peacefully seceded from the union, similarly to how Thomas Jefferson's Declaration of Independence entailed a peaceful removal from the British Crown. It was Northern Aggression that triggered the civil war. Confederates weren't necessarily traitors. They felt that their desires were being neglected and DID something about it. And they DEFENDED themselves from Northern Aggression, similarly to how America defended ourselves in the Revolutionary War. I'm not trying to advocate for slavery, however I am trying to enlighten people that the confederate flag  and statues symbolize MORE than just slavery. It is ironic that a nation built off rebellion is so quick to shut down the beliefs of others (regardless if they were morally bankrupt) America, before the rev. war, was big on smuggling too, and even after the constitution did they fail to address slavery. So if you want to point fingers, really, point them at the Federalists who had the chance to DIPLOMATICALLY nip slavery in the bud. All in all, the confederacy stood for southern pride, not just slavery. It is arguable that if slavery wasn't an issue, there still would have been a civil war. The men glorified in those statues are glorified bc they put their life on the line to protect the nation they sought to build that was best fit for them. Yes, they lost, yes, they advocated for slavery. But it is in our best interest to realize that we glorify people in history for their good deeds. For example, despite George Washington or Thomas Jefferson being slave owners, we recognize them as Founding Fathers; despite Robert E. Lee fighting for a nation that advocated slavery, we FAIL to recognize that he was one of the most superior Generals in American History. \\n\\nSpeaking or irony isn't SO FUNNY how we recognize George Washington to be a hero and a FANTASTIC general, even though in the French and Indian war did he literally set up the British for failure, and in the revolutionary war did he have a losing streak of 7 that he broke in the Battle of Trenton where a bunch of Americans surprise attacked a bunch of drunk Germans of Christmas Morning. \\n\\nAhhh, I love history.",0,0

Yes. Was it heir primary incentive? Absolutely not. Go read history books based on facts instead of biased today media.\\nThey were bad people at that time, ugly people, on both sides, and most soliders and officers just fought for their land and their way of life, not for ideological reasons. \\nPeople calling southerners traitors are idiots.

The problem with taking down statues, is that we can't pick and choose what we like about our past.

J5b_-TZwQ0I,"I agree with you about the confederacy, but your argument about states' rights vs slavery as what the civil war is mainly about is slightly misleading. The issue of southern states wanting more power than the federal government was a decades long development of tension leading up to the 1860 election. Lincoln was NOT outwardly against slavery at that point. The south simply saw him as a man that would limit their power, and his election was the last straw. Lincoln only attempted to end slavery in order to gain support for the union from runaway slaves and to cripple the south's workforce by encouraging slaves to run away. He was never strongly against slavery on any moral grounds. To clarify, the issue of states' rights CAUSED the Civil War, but slavery's demise and the ensuing rights of former slaves were its most significant EFFECT.",0,1
J5b_-TZwQ0I,"Yeah, slavery is awful. Defending the right to own another human being. Abominable. And now think about what you defend today. You defend private property, don't you? Even with no perspective of actually having some, you defend the right.

Those inanimate objects don't have rights.

I can attest to some of the stranger dangers of working with animals, the methane thing is definitely true, we have giant pits under the farrowing room and nursery that build up all the manure, urine, and other nastiness over the course of a month (the film that develops on top keeps the fumes contained) but when we drain the pit, the room is a hazard zone for a couple of hours due to all the methane and toxic fumes. And that's just our little pig farm, on massive commercial ones, quite a few people have died walking into a room where the pit is draining because of all the gases.

WQjO1mMCPg4,This is legit wrong on every single occasion. There was honestly not one single thing accurate about it. I worked at maccas for 4 years and there are memes made by random neck beards that are more accurate than all of these. They did mention the ice cream machine being broken meme very briefly but even then the machine never break it just goes on a cleaning cycle every now and then just like the frozen Coke machines so we can't use it for a while and the average maccas customer isn't smart enough to comprehend that so we just say it's broken. Sauce wise we use sauce guns that portion it for us so the only way to stuff that up is to double shot accidentally. I could continue but I think I've done too much already.,0,0

Did Martha start chewing so he immediately thrust his fingers in there to try and pry open her mouth? Oh God! Was this a male pig? Am I ever going to be able to watch Babe again? That’ll do pig, that’ll do. Eeeeewwwwwwwwwwww!!! Did he yell Suuuuuuuueeeeeyyyy! I’m assuming the only way they knew the pig ate it was to kill the pig and open it up, so, did they end up making bacon and sausage ....Urckk, urh (Grabs mouth) Why did you include this story? Couldn’t you have just said a farmer was killed by his pet pig and leave it at that? I would’ve believed you! Do I really want to finish this video? Do you have more disgusting facts in here? You do, don’t cha? What if there were two pigs and both had some ....parts and one escaped, only to be captured down the road by another farmer who took that pig to slaughter. Is there a chance somebody is eating penis bacon tomorrow for breakfast? God knows I don’t eat pork, so, shout out to Samuel L. Jackson in Pulp Fiction for breaking it down to me that pig is a nasty beast that roots in his own shyt, that’s when I stopped eating it. Oh Snap!

cWIEF2Yc58w,"Christmas and the Winter solstice; \\nThe winter solstice is not about the rebirth of a god. Although the sun has been worshiped as God and many of these beliefs and traditions have been passed along to Christianity. The winter solstice is about our human history thousands of years before Jesus.\\nOur ancestors built solar temples and observatories all over the world to measure this day. These observatories were built of rock and stone and while they are accurate they are affected by the effects of precession. In many cases if not most, the Sun strikes the mark on three days. The Sun-worshipers called it three days of death because the sun stops moving along the horizon to the south. The rebirth is when the sun begins to move back to the north.\\n\\n One of the older known solar observatory is found in Africa and has been dated to around 8500 BCE. Stonehenge is another example which has been studied extensively. While we don’t know what these ancient people believed, we know they were observing and celebrating the winter solstice. The discovery of the winter solstice is how man learned to measure a solar year and the observation of this day is beneficial in determining the proper time of year to plant crops among other things.\\nThis discovery is in a sense the discovery of time. [The Dawn of Time.]\\nOur modern world revolves around this discovery.\\n\\nFrom that first year forward, the winter solstice has been a day of celebration which marks a solar year.\\n\\nWe celebrate The Dawn of Time”.\\n\\nHave a very happy Winter Solstice.\\nAnd may good fortune and happiness be yours.\\n\\n************************************************************************************************************************",0,0

cWIEF2Yc58w,"Christmas and the Winter solstice; \\nThe winter solstice is not about the rebirth of a god. Although the sun has been worshiped as God and many of these beliefs and traditions have been passed along to Christianity. The winter solstice is about our human history thousands of years before Jesus.\\nOur ancestors built solar temples and observatories all over the world to measure this day. These observatories were built of rock and stone and while they are accurate they are affected by the effects of precession. In many cases if not most, the Sun strikes the mark on three days. The Sun-worshipers called it three days of death because the sun stops moving along the horizon to the south. The rebirth is when the sun begins to move back to the north.\\n\\n One of the older known solar observatory is found in Africa and has been dated to around 8500 BCE. Stonehenge is another example which has been studied extensively. While we don’t know what these ancient people believed, we know they were observing and celebrating the winter solstice. The discovery of the winter solstice is how man learned to measure a solar year and the observation of this day is beneficial in determining the proper time of year to plant crops among other things.\\nThis discovery is in a sense the discovery of time. [The Dawn of Time.]\\nOur modern world revolves around this discovery.\\n\\nFrom that first year forward, the winter solstice has been a day of celebration which marks a solar year.\\n\\nWe celebrate The Dawn of Time”.\\n\\nHave a very happy Winter Solstice.\\nAnd may good fortune and happiness be yours.\\n\\n************************************************************************************************************************",0,0

I give the benefit of the doubt. Still though, it's chemistry. It's at a subconscious level. Same thing about me and how I get off same for them and what gets them off. Whatever gets us off. Will get us off. From the straightest of the straights to well, blegh pedophiles. It's not an excuse for them, ofcourse it is not. Just a fact.  So when the term asking for it is used this way in language, it is not to be confused with testimonials of rapists. But technically they are wired so wrong, in their heads their victims were. Which is based upon the simplistic desires amplified and out of control for them.

cWIEF2Yc58w,"Christmas and the Winter solstice; \\nThe winter solstice is not about the rebirth of a god. Although the sun has been worshiped as God and many of these beliefs and traditions have been passed along to Christianity. The winter solstice is about our human history thousands of years before Jesus.\\nOur ancestors built solar temples and observatories all over the world to measure this day. These observatories were built of rock and stone and while they are accurate they are affected by the effects of precession. In many cases if not most, the Sun strikes the mark on three days. The Sun-worshipers called it three days of death because the sun stops moving along the horizon to the south. The rebirth is when the sun begins to move back to the north.\\n\\n One of the older known solar observatory is found in Africa and has been dated to around 8500 BCE. Stonehenge is another example which has been studied extensively. While we don’t know what these ancient people believed, we know they were observing and celebrating the winter solstice. The discovery of the winter solstice is how man learned to measure a solar year and the observation of this day is beneficial in determining the proper time of year to plant crops among other things.\\nThis discovery is in a sense the discovery of time. [The Dawn of Time.]\\nOur modern world revolves around this discovery.\\n\\nFrom that first year forward, the winter solstice has been a day of celebration which marks a solar year.\\n\\nWe celebrate The Dawn of Time”.\\n\\nHave a very happy Winter Solstice.\\nAnd may good fortune and happiness be yours.\\n\\n************************************************************************************************************************",0,0

You will pay for the service wether its through a private cooperation or the federal government. HOWERVER, its truely free if you do your taxes yourself... I could write an essey about why we decided to use third party coorperations to cut out the fact that the federal government tried to arbitrate your right to sue them in the past for overtaxing Americans and really hurting the average Joe in the 40's and 50's. But I'll let you do more than watch youtube to make your own opinion. Also, I'm not endorsing H&R block or turbo tax.

cWIEF2Yc58w,"Christmas and the Winter solstice; \\nThe winter solstice is not about the rebirth of a god. Although the sun has been worshiped as God and many of these beliefs and traditions have been passed along to Christianity. The winter solstice is about our human history thousands of years before Jesus.\\nOur ancestors built solar temples and observatories all over the world to measure this day. These observatories were built of rock and stone and while they are accurate they are affected by the effects of precession. In many cases if not most, the Sun strikes the mark on three days. The Sun-worshipers called it three days of death because the sun stops moving along the horizon to the south. The rebirth is when the sun begins to move back to the north.\\n\\n One of the older known solar observatory is found in Africa and has been dated to around 8500 BCE. Stonehenge is another example which has been studied extensively. While we don’t know what these ancient people believed, we know they were observing and celebrating the winter solstice. The discovery of the winter solstice is how man learned to measure a solar year and the observation of this day is beneficial in determining the proper time of year to plant crops among other things.\\nThis discovery is in a sense the discovery of time. [The Dawn of Time.]\\nOur modern world revolves around this discovery.\\n\\nFrom that first year forward, the winter solstice has been a day of celebration which marks a solar year.\\n\\nWe celebrate The Dawn of Time”.\\n\\nHave a very happy Winter Solstice.\\nAnd may good fortune and happiness be yours.\\n\\n************************************************************************************************************************",0,0

Most people won't be using more than your standard 1040, schedule A,C,D which are itemizations, business income, stocks. Also note that if you're low income chances are you qualify for earned income tax credit and the threshold for qualifying increases with more dependents.

vGVK4ibMI-Y,Alot of commie bastards in the comment section. God damn why can't we just live the ways that America was found upon instead of this socialist bullshit thats literally going to destroy our country. You can't be a capitalist nation with all of these regulations or else it is not capitalism and will never work properly. If a rich person is paying a flat rate of 10% that is significantly higher than a low income person that pays 10% anything higher than that is not right because the people that earn their money shouldn't have to fork half of it to the government for it to be wasted on nothing.,0,0

Them reporting your bank accounts and deposits is part of crazy drug enforcement laws, where depositing over $5000 or even under that can be an IRS crime where they can seize the money, cuz it must be drugs.  Where in the constitution does it give the federal government authority to collect such private information?  No where.  Rather the supreme court on a number of occasions has said a right to privacy is one of those 10th amendment god given rights, that the government should not be spying on you.  Granted the fed ignores this with mass collection of illegal data collected and stored and lies about doing it (creating perjury to congress even.)  It is an unconstitutional power, just like direct taxes SHOULD be by the framers.  But they also did not want a standing army, or policing the world, or entangling treaties with Europe.",0,0

That's right you don't and we NEED Megabots to look good since Ameirca is the only one who could make this whole sport work.

Z-ouLX8Q9UM,I don't think this was a scripted fight but since this is the first combat between these machines there are going to be limitations. Safety concerns are going to rule out some stuff as well as the reactions to unknown elements. Each design needs improvements and a lot was likely learned from this. There is also the limits of the pilots as they have no combat experience before this. It is also important to consider that they probably do not want to utterly destroy expensive robots in the first go.  I would expect more in the future as these are controlled remotely.,0,0

Japan should have had the advantage but it seems they were more focused on making their robot look cool! What the hell was the drone for lol??? The US team won because they focused on innovation!! The chainsaw was awesome very effective!!! The US team even used the battle field to their advantage knocking cars over to block the other robot!!

Z-ouLX8Q9UM,"I get why people are so annoyed with this. I think it's cool, but this entire thing feels like it's scripted due to the poor cinematography involved and how it was pre-recorded rather than a live feed recording. My hope is this helps spark better designs and more of this in the future at some point. One thing to note is that since this is the FIRST duel of its kind, there probably weren't too many set rules aside from 'no lethal weapons' such as explosive rockets and the like. The EPrime-bot was prepared for melee far more than the Kuratas, having its chainsaw compared to the unfortunately lacking power of the Kuratas fist in this instance. While it wasn't exactly a 'fair' match per sey in some peoples' eyes it provides a basis for better ones in the future, so keep that in mind.",0,0
Z-ouLX8Q9UM,This is pretty much how I saw the first humanized mech robot fights going.   Pretty plain jane but it has to start somewhere.   Give it a few years. And lethal weapons maybe or humanless robots in kinda the battle bots style will be the thing.,0,0

XPqko6Q0lpE,"In the UK, the entirety of the BBC knew about Jimmy Saville being a pedo, but did nothing about it and let it continue because they didn't want to rock the boat. In Churches, pedophile priests were moved from diocese to diocese everytime the locals became aware of their perversions, and the best one to move them was Ratzinger, later Pope John Paul II. Everyone knew it was happening and even joked about it, but no-one did anything. In London, the British Parliament under Maggie Thatcher were practically spilling over with pedophiles and perverts, and the entire Parliament knew about it, but it was bad for your career to stand up so no-one did.\\n\\nI'm sorry to say, but when you have positions of power, people with incredibly evil predatory ambitions will seek those positions out to get access to what the normal public cant. That will always happen. But it's too sick and wrong that people who are normal, WILL NOT SPEAK UP WHEN THEY KNOW ABOUT IT. Like fuck me who cares if you have to take a regular 9-5 office job after, you stopped some poor kid (including young adults) from being taken advantage of! Speak up and speak out.

cWIEF2Yc58w,"Christmas and the Winter solstice; \\nThe winter solstice is not about the rebirth of a god. Although the sun has been worshiped as God and many of these beliefs and traditions have been passed along to Christianity. The winter solstice is about our human history thousands of years before Jesus.\\nOur ancestors built solar temples and observatories all over the world to measure this day. These observatories were built of rock and stone and while they are accurate they are affected by the effects of precession. In many cases if not most, the Sun strikes the mark on three days. The Sun-worshipers called it three days of death because the sun stops moving along the horizon to the south. The rebirth is when the sun begins to move back to the north.\\n\\n One of the older known solar observatory is found in Africa and has been dated to around 8500 BCE. Stonehenge is another example which has been studied extensively. While we don’t know what these ancient people believed, we know they were observing and celebrating the winter solstice. The discovery of the winter solstice is how man learned to measure a solar year and the observation of this day is beneficial in determining the proper time of year to plant crops among other things.\\nThis discovery is in a sense the discovery of time. [The Dawn of Time.]\\nOur modern world revolves around this discovery.\\n\\nFrom that first year forward, the winter solstice has been a day of celebration which marks a solar year.\\n\\nWe celebrate The Dawn of Time”.\\n\\nHave a very happy Winter Solstice.\\nAnd may good fortune and happiness be yours.\\n\\n************************************************************************************************************************",0,0

The US is not allowed to audit the Federal reserve for any means or reason.  \\n\\nI'm truth, the modern tax system is theft upon the US individual.  There is no reason for there being tax codes being more than 74k pages.

Because of the the varying deductions people can have that the IRS knows nothing about (charity giving as an example) they can't figure out exactly what you owe.  \\n\\nI know the end of that part of the segment kind of suggested that we could correct it, but that is apparently why audits happen, because people take deductions they can't prove.  The filing is to make you prove your deductions.\\n\\nJust wanted to add some additional information from what I learned talking to someone about it.

vGVK4ibMI-Y,"The only things Adam consistently ruins are reason, sound research practices, and masculinity.\\n\\nHere are a few reasons he's wrong (as usual) this time:\\n\\n1. Government preparation of returns would require payers of income—employers, financial institutions, even governments writing benefits checks—to incur costs by significantly moving up reporting deadlines for the IRS to get the information in enough time so that tax refunds are not delayed. Advocates of return-free filing conveniently ignore these third-party costs. A study or two has suggested that third-party costs would range from $500 million to $5 billion annually and would fall disproportionally on small businesses and therefore indirectly benefit the bigger corporations with which small businesses must compete.\\n\\n2. The IRS is a lumbering behemoth. Its computer systems have long been plagued with problems and cost overruns, as pointed out by the Government Accountability Office and others. A 2003 Treasury report found that under the current complex tax code, providing taxpayers with pre-filled returns would add to the workload of the IRS. Clearly, additional investment in staff, equipment and facilities would be required... which would require, you guessed it, higher taxes to pay for.\\n\\n3. Checking your government-prepared tax return for accuracy would take about the same work and time as preparing your own from scratch. Unless you're going to just trust them to be 100% accurate and honest, what's the point?\\n\\n4. He looks like just like the Adoring Fan from Oblivion.\\n\\n5.

Z-ouLX8Q9UM,"disappointed by japan's lack of development in the kuratas in terms of weapons, design and tactics. For the US i think the mk 3 didn't make use of its incredible torso speed and leaning ability for maneuvering and hitting, and other weapons that were tested before. I think the space used was too small to build up speed and momentum, and for the kuratas to back away for more hits at the mk 3 with the half ton fist. Overall considering how big a role safety plays in the match (concern for opponents safety and such) i think it went well, but could be better in the future with more experience on safety measures so pilots and audience safety would not be an issue for more destructive action to take place.",0,0

XPqko6Q0lpE,"In the UK, the entirety of the BBC knew about Jimmy Saville being a pedo, but did nothing about it and let it continue because they didn't want to rock the boat. In Churches, pedophile priests were moved from diocese to diocese everytime the locals became aware of their perversions, and the best one to move them was Ratzinger, later Pope John Paul II. Everyone knew it was happening and even joked about it, but no-one did anything. In London, the British Parliament under Maggie Thatcher were practically spilling over with pedophiles and perverts, and the entire Parliament knew about it, but it was bad for your career to stand up so no-one did.\\n\\nI'm sorry to say, but when you have positions of power, people with incredibly evil predatory ambitions will seek those positions out to get access to what the normal public cant. That will always happen. But it's too sick and wrong that people who are normal, WILL NOT SPEAK UP WHEN THEY KNOW ABOUT IT. Like fuck me who cares if you have to take a regular 9-5 office job after, you stopped some poor kid (including young adults) from being taken advantage of! Speak up and speak out.

The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Rick’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance.

crY-q80MfJU,"could you explain that?\\nDoes lightning strike from the sky down, or the ground up?\\n\\nThe answer is both. Cloud-to-ground lightning comes from the sky down, but the part you see comes from the ground up. A typical cloud-to-ground flash lowers a path of negative electricity (that we cannot see) towards the ground in a series of spurts. Objects on the ground generally have a positive charge. Since opposites attract, an upward streamer is sent out from the object about to be struck. When these two paths meet, a return stroke zips back up to the sky. It is the return stroke that produces the visible flash, but it all happens so fast - in about one-millionth of a second - so the human eye doesn't see the actual formation of the stroke.",0,0

It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand and are capable of being MY coconut lover.

F66vX1WCRbs,"I get the feeling that this song is entirely different from previous songs of Rachel’s. It’s not uplifting, but it’s not a stupid song, either. I’m not saying it puts you down, but for some reason, it’s just a song that could never fit into a music song category, in terms of what it’s about. It’s a song indescribable, like when you know what a word means but don’t know how to explain it. It can’t even actually be interpreted except by the person who wrote it. It’s not like Fight Song, which is saying “I will rise.” It’s not like Perfect for You, which is saying, “I am my own person. I will not change for anybody. I am perfect to myself.” It’s not like songs like Gorgeous or Look What You Made Me Do or really any other song. It is a song that isn’t about what it’s about. (It’s about love, but it isn’t.) This is the most imperfect song. Making imperfect songs that are indescribable is an art only mastered by artists like Rachel. It cannot be described, judged, understood, or anything. It can only be misunderstood. It is a song like no other. It is a song that only comes once. Thanks, Rachel, for the song. You truly are a master at your art. And it’s because imperfect songs are the best ones.",0,0

vGVK4ibMI-Y,"The only things Adam consistently ruins are reason, sound research practices, and masculinity.\\n\\nHere are a few reasons he's wrong (as usual) this time:\\n\\n1. Government preparation of returns would require payers of income—employers, financial institutions, even governments writing benefits checks—to incur costs by significantly moving up reporting deadlines for the IRS to get the information in enough time so that tax refunds are not delayed. Advocates of return-free filing conveniently ignore these third-party costs. A study or two has suggested that third-party costs would range from $500 million to $5 billion annually and would fall disproportionally on small businesses and therefore indirectly benefit the bigger corporations with which small businesses must compete.\\n\\n2. The IRS is a lumbering behemoth. Its computer systems have long been plagued with problems and cost overruns, as pointed out by the Government Accountability Office and others. A 2003 Treasury report found that under the current complex tax code, providing taxpayers with pre-filled returns would add to the workload of the IRS. Clearly, additional investment in staff, equipment and facilities would be required... which would require, you guessed it, higher taxes to pay for.\\n\\n3. Checking your government-prepared tax return for accuracy would take about the same work and time as preparing your own from scratch. Unless you're going to just trust them to be 100% accurate and honest, what's the point?\\n\\n4. He looks like just like the Adoring Fan from Oblivion.\\n\\n5.

vGVK4ibMI-Y,"There is no underlaying law that dictates a person has to pay taxes.  Yet you are forced to pay taxes to the IRS so they may be able to pay national debt to the Federal reserve.  The Federal reserve is a privately owned bank that works like a corporation, but has the legal ability to print us money, but in turn, charges the US to do so.  In turn, this raises the debt owed.  The US is not allowed to audit the Federal reserve for any means or reason.  \\n\\nI'm truth, the modern tax system is theft upon the US individual.  There is no reason for there being tax codes being more than 74k pages.  You are forced to pay a tax amount against your will even though there's no true law stating that not filling your taxes is against the law.\\n\\nThe Federal reserve is part of this issue.  \\n\\nTaxation upon our populace caused a war once before.\\n\\nA president caught the mainstay of Banks and one.\\n\\nIt will happen again.",0,1

Z-ouLX8Q9UM,"The battle was lame and awesome at the same time. Yeah, it lacked action and commentators were overreacting, but that's what you should expect from the first ever bot fight.\\nI'm pretty sure, if it wasn't for pilot's safety, the battle could have been much more entertaining to watch, because robots would probably have real guns and shit like that. I guess they should make robots that don't need pilots in them, being fully remotely controlled.\\n\\nI really hope that it was a nice start and people will continue to build giant ass robots, making them better, stronger, faster.

Z-ouLX8Q9UM,"Congratulations, years of buildup and a huge budget to make something with less impact and excitement than the japanese fighting toy robot competitions.\\n\\nNotice there's no live audience or audience footage looking up at any sort of jumbotron like any other event like this would have.  Because imagine all the hype up and wait, buying tickets to an event and you finally get there to watch two sub-grandma wheelchair speed moving giant pieces of shit slowly rubbing against each other.

Since they realized how lame it actually was in action and how little worthwhile footage they had and had to shoehorn in epic music and angles to try to disguise the boring action. \\n\\nIs this lame because we can't have anyone possibly getting hurt and sueing anymore? Is this lame because they hoped the OMFG ROBOTS ANIME IS REAL delusion and hype would hold out and sustain it?\\n\\nNo matter why it's lame or what made it lame. It's fucking lame.",1,0

This as a global sport would be amazing!!!\n\nThat Japanese robot was awesome!!! 18mph is pretty darn fast compared to the American bots. The American bots were huge.
