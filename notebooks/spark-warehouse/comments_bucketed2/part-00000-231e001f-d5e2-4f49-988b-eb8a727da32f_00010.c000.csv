EuvVOA8uvsc,"Sweet video. Looking forward to the album because these boys do not write bad music. The stylistic genre that this might be categorized into, might not be your thing, but as it's been said many times here, We're Enter Shikari and we've been abusing music's worthless genre boundaries since 2003. This is true on their lyrical content as well as their musical diversity. Not every song is going to be a winner with everyone. The same can be said for any fan of any band or any form of media for that matter. Does that make it a bad, not at all; it just means that you don't care for it, but someone else may. \\n\\nBottom line, this sounds something like that would have come out around the time of, We Can Breathe in Space and Tribalism with the production level of The Mindsweep. I mean Live Outside now that I think about it, really reminds me of a happier sounding version of Thumper.",1,0

I've seen videos from big names come down here to taste our food, like Anthony Bourdain and Gordan Ramsay. They showcased our food and sang them praises, but you... you just GET IT!\\n\\nI only wish I had followed you on your other social media, I didn't realise you came down here!

_5ZrSKpbdSg,"O.K., there are a lot of wonderfully intelligent people who have posted about the beauty of this video. Ever since I watched this inspiring video on NASA TV this morning, I've been haunted by this ONE MINUTE AND TEN SECOND soundtrack. The wordless chorus leaves me speechless and tears well up each time I play it. \\n\\nIt's as though I am a parishioner in an ongoing church service each time I hear it. \\n\\nThis music become more and more haunting and becomes more ingrained in me each and every time I hear it. Has it affected anyone else in this way? \\n\\nCan someone please, please tell me what the title of this music is, who composed it, and where I might find more information or a copy? \\n\\nThank you for taking the time to respond...and God Bless everyone involved with the Cassini program, particularly those who were with her until she breathed her last breath. \\n\\nAnd what it it to cease breathing, but to free the breath from its restless tides, that may rise and expand and seek God unencumbered?",1,0
_5ZrSKpbdSg,"With the advances in tech since Cassini was built (late 80s tech really) I think an ideal follow up would be a pair of orbiters,  with similar capabilities to casssini (which presumably can be done for half or better the price as digital tech is halving in price and doubling in performance just about year on year) 2 orbiters,  one for Neptune and one for Uranus,  to complete the detailed study of the solar system. \\n\\nI'm not sure if they could be sent on the same rocket... Since the alignment that made voyager possible was a rarity, but I'm sure if it is (I. E travel together to Uranus,  then the Neptune bound probe leaves the Uranus probe before it makes it orbital insertion burn,  and use Uranus for a slingshot out to Neptune.... Which may require years and a few trips round the sun to raise its orbit to encounter Neptune.... \\n\\nIt's worth doing. Triton is a moon well worth looking at... And the source of Neptune's wind speeds is a question we would all like to see answered.. Not to mention the nature of Uranus and it's bizarre tilt.. \\n\\nThough I am of course pleased with Europa Clipper.... It's just such a shame exploration in space is always limited to one or two major missions..... When if any of us we're in charge,  we would have built several 'cassinis' (and possibly enjoyed some economy in scale) and sent them all over! \\n\\nSame goes for the curiosity Rover.   A marvel,  but why must it always be a unique and bespoke machine,  as if to maximize it's expense? Why could there not be a base Rover design,  make a number of them for landing in a number of places? \\n\\nFor example,  why is there not a base line space probe bus,  which can have bespoke instruments attached,  as target and mission requires? Much in the way Voyager/ Pioneer was done.... Their spacecraft busses were largely the same.... And look what they achieved. \\n\\nWould their not be savings in building another csssini but with 22St century equipment? \\n\\nI have never understood why beach mission requires a brand new and untested design EVERY time.",1,0

I hate Windows, but I need the Creative Suite to do my job so I can't switch to Linux even though I would prefer to have a linux style command line natively. \\n\\nFor the last 10 years I've been using macs almost exclusively for professional web and app development and design due to their Unix/BSD based command line, support for all of the programs and tools I need, and high quality hardware in an affordable for professionals price point. The new Macbook Pro that gets rid of the function keys and escape key that also isn't reliable is a no go. The Mac Pro hasn't been updated in 4 years, and the 5k iMac that doesn't have the hardware specs to even support a 5k screen is utter stupidity. The iPhone X is a joke, and even though i really need to upgrade my iPhone 6s+ that is now over 2 years old, there's no way I'm paying $1,000 for a sub par Galaxy S8 with the two dumbest ideas they've probably ever decided to implement: the top cut away for the screen, and no headphone jack.",0,0

_5ZrSKpbdSg,"With the advances in tech since Cassini was built (late 80s tech really) I think an ideal follow up would be a pair of orbiters,  with similar capabilities to casssini (which presumably can be done for half or better the price as digital tech is halving in price and doubling in performance just about year on year) 2 orbiters,  one for Neptune and one for Uranus,  to complete the detailed study of the solar system. \\n\\nI'm not sure if they could be sent on the same rocket... Since the alignment that made voyager possible was a rarity, but I'm sure if it is (I. E travel together to Uranus,  then the Neptune bound probe leaves the Uranus probe before it makes it orbital insertion burn,  and use Uranus for a slingshot out to Neptune.... Which may require years and a few trips round the sun to raise its orbit to encounter Neptune.... \\n\\nIt's worth doing. Triton is a moon well worth looking at... And the source of Neptune's wind speeds is a question we would all like to see answered.. Not to mention the nature of Uranus and it's bizarre tilt.. \\n\\nThough I am of course pleased with Europa Clipper.... It's just such a shame exploration in space is always limited to one or two major missions..... When if any of us we're in charge,  we would have built several 'cassinis' (and possibly enjoyed some economy in scale) and sent them all over! \\n\\nSame goes for the curiosity Rover.   A marvel,  but why must it always be a unique and bespoke machine,  as if to maximize it's expense? Why could there not be a base Rover design,  make a number of them for landing in a number of places? \\n\\nFor example,  why is there not a base line space probe bus,  which can have bespoke instruments attached,  as target and mission requires? Much in the way Voyager/ Pioneer was done.... Their spacecraft busses were largely the same.... And look what they achieved. \\n\\nWould their not be savings in building another csssini but with 22St century equipment? \\n\\nI have never understood why beach mission requires a brand new and untested design EVERY time.",1,0

EuvVOA8uvsc,"I'm probably slow for only noticing this now but at around 1:36 I noticed a bit of flickering almost like TV static on the right side of the versions of all 4 of them in the lab coats (our right, their left), implying that there might not actually be like any real people up there and almost as if those are just holograms projected down to the real people sitting in the chair.

EuvVOA8uvsc,"WHOA HAHA XD DUDE BRO IT'S ENTER SHIKARI MUSIC BOUNDRIES ARE POINTLESS LOL\\n\\nyeah but music is supposed to inspire something interesting, evoke some sort of emotion\\n\\nthis just seems bland, tired. it's like there's no soul. Live Outside was at least something interesting while being different but this is just a big build up to nothing. What am I nervous of? it's like a declawed cat. There's no punch. I won't sit here and say EVERY ALBUM IS WORSE THAN THE LAST ;((( because I think every album has something interesting. There were people saying the same thing right before Mindsweep, which was a pretty good album by my standards.\\n\\nLike, you know music isn't made only to be different and to ABUSE WORTHLESS GENRE BOUNDRIES LOL right?\\n\\nIt's funny because the more radical and clear their message gets the more and more produced and mechanical their music sounds. It feels like any sort of generic product I'd buy off a shelf: Great Value Punk.",0,0

It's no longer about the genre or heaviness, it's all about that shikari essence, and both Live Outside and Rabble Rouser have plenty of it.

EuvVOA8uvsc,"Maybe the video is a metaphorical representation of their music? Every single Enter Shikari song is different from the others, so it's like they are duplicating themselves, as a band, every time they release a new song: they look the same, but they are never the same, as the previous clone (so their style in every song)  gets eliminated. Maybe just stupid but this is my first interpretation. There might be something deeper, and I'll try to figure it out.",2,2

I will note that we did SSD upgrades on them all but they all also only have 4GB of ram and it works great with no issues. Also, I use mine for daily development.

It's not too bad, just amateurish. What he's saying is scripted, and if he learned to mark his copy before making it, it'd sound better. He needs to learn to vary his delivery so he avoids things like dropping down on the last word of every sentence the way he tends to do.

Eef-1HLKgoQ,"I guess not many people in the comment section liked this movie. :/ I adored it. Not because of women empowerment or whatever you wanna call it. I'm a female, but I'm for human empowerment. Gender doesn't matter when confidence is the topic. I loved the movie because I felt it's exactly how a great superhero movie should look like. To me, it felt balanced, with intrigue, drama, comedy, action, and relatability. The women who are complaining about WW not being relatable simply because she's a goddess are missing the point. We can ALL relate to her compassion, kindness, strong will, the desire to help others in need, her curious nature, her inquisitiveness, her desire for knowledge, etc. All superheros were created to, not only be a beacon of hope, but also to have characteristics and desires that we, as humans, can strive for. Except for Batman, cuz he's quite a downer. Don't be like Batman, aside from the billionaire part. :P \\n\\nAlso, good god, that WW main theme! <333 That one is definitely going in the top 5 list of my fave superhero themes.

Yeah a good movie, but I would not put it above Batman vs Superman, they are more likely levelled.

Eef-1HLKgoQ,"Upvote for the reminder that Germans weren't the ultimate evil in WWI. But about the next sentences, they get kinda explained in the movie. Didn't Diana lose all her hope in mankind and was mourning about the death of her favourite human (maybe because she felt guilty of it)? So when the next world war broke out, she was probably still convinced, that humans are garbage that needs to be cleansed, while she used her time to look for love again/ mourne more, or maybe she was looking for the real reason for the war again, like an Ares behind all of it. So she missed the next wars. Until someone convinced her, that she has to act again, to defeat not a huge enemy army full of poor people, but an actual monster in not a horrible war, but one single battle. She was always wobbling between the possibilities that humans are either cruel war-loving creatures, or poor controlled victims, which maybe makes her decision not to save them or not to fight them somehow explainable.",0,0

You bared your soul to us all -- as only great, talented, true artists do, and real, genuine, in-tune humans can -- and so we do care. A lot. About you, and your passing. RIP, bro. Your voice and singing words have always connected with and moved many of us all, and will always do so by living on & continuing to touch many more of us in the future.

Nobody else has anything like it but I hated my name growing up because I just want to fit in and just be a Jenny or a Peggy or something but now I guess I had my own license plate but no one can ever seem to pronounce it right and that gets annoying\\npretty quickly.

_5ZrSKpbdSg,"With the advances in tech since Cassini was built (late 80s tech really) I think an ideal follow up would be a pair of orbiters,  with similar capabilities to casssini (which presumably can be done for half or better the price as digital tech is halving in price and doubling in performance just about year on year) 2 orbiters,  one for Neptune and one for Uranus,  to complete the detailed study of the solar system. \\n\\nI'm not sure if they could be sent on the same rocket... Since the alignment that made voyager possible was a rarity, but I'm sure if it is (I. E travel together to Uranus,  then the Neptune bound probe leaves the Uranus probe before it makes it orbital insertion burn,  and use Uranus for a slingshot out to Neptune.... Which may require years and a few trips round the sun to raise its orbit to encounter Neptune.... \\n\\nIt's worth doing. Triton is a moon well worth looking at... And the source of Neptune's wind speeds is a question we would all like to see answered.. Not to mention the nature of Uranus and it's bizarre tilt.. \\n\\nThough I am of course pleased with Europa Clipper.... It's just such a shame exploration in space is always limited to one or two major missions..... When if any of us we're in charge,  we would have built several 'cassinis' (and possibly enjoyed some economy in scale) and sent them all over! \\n\\nSame goes for the curiosity Rover.   A marvel,  but why must it always be a unique and bespoke machine,  as if to maximize it's expense? Why could there not be a base Rover design,  make a number of them for landing in a number of places? \\n\\nFor example,  why is there not a base line space probe bus,  which can have bespoke instruments attached,  as target and mission requires? Much in the way Voyager/ Pioneer was done.... Their spacecraft busses were largely the same.... And look what they achieved. \\n\\nWould their not be savings in building another csssini but with 22St century equipment? \\n\\nI have never understood why beach mission requires a brand new and untested design EVERY time.",1,0

0ptNpGfMRCg,"video was too long. Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich. But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching a video and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to finish the video. She said, you know what, I've been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer. So we opened that drawer, and lo and behold, there's my phone and this video still had four minutes of play time on it.",0,0

BwYPddy_5bk,"For me, suburbia is the way to go. A few minutes drive to the exciting city, a few minutes walk to a nice forest. You get to have neighbours that are neither hill-billies nor a wall away from you. You get to make good money working in the city, and have the land cheep enough to have a large garden.

BwYPddy_5bk,"Well, I am an Archaeology major and in my semi-professional opinion(not really I'm a student), it really depends on where in the world you are. For Europe I would look to London, one of the first proper cities in the world and what drove people there I would argue (from my limited knowledge) was the sectioning off of the agricultural land and by maximizing production those feudal lords were literally kicking people off so the lords could maximise production. There is actually a stark difference between the field layouts before and after this happened.This drove people on a massive scale towards the urban landscape. For the middle east, possibly congregation near water sources, like the Nile. Sorry, I just studied agriculture not state formation in the middle east. For Asia... I'm going to just stick with China and point towards the either the Xia dynasty or the Shang Dynasty for first cities, possibly Anyang? It was the capital of the late Shang. But China is so old that you could argue that the Liangzhu Culture had a city. And one strong argument suggested was the over-exploitation of the environment by agriculture led to the deterioration of the ecosystem and so this forced people into complex socio-economic strategies. I'm not too sure for the Americas, I have yet to study these regions, sorry. \\nTL:DR People were either forced or they saw the benefits of being near a river and just kinda stayed there.

A small hunter-gatherer band, on the other hand, is much higher variance — sure, there are good years where you bring down the megafauna easily and have plenty of time left over for monkey-politics and scoodilypooping, but when the megafauna go extinct because humans are just too damn good at hunting them, or when one hunting expedition goes badly wrong and all the tribe's males suffer crippling injuries and can't hunt any more, that tribe suddenly doesn't have any more descendants.\\n(Herding also scores pretty well on this keep variance down metric, since a flock of animals is a store of food that — unlike grain — doesn't rot and can walk.  But it doesn't scale up as well as agriculture, unless you are the Mongols.)",0,0

BwYPddy_5bk,"I'm quite convinced actually that cities formed because there's just something about so many people being in one place that is more interesting than any other system. Like, I have tons of opinions, and I believe very little, but here is something I believe: life is about people. I mean this very broadly, as in you will never really escape the central theme of life that is the people that live within it, around you. Your happiness is never completely independent of the existence and status of others. Existence is partly the awareness of other existence's and dealing with that in any way you do; and even if it isn't, that's what we do anyways because it's hardwired in our genes. Either way, the most interesting thing to most people will always be people, most of the time. So, cities form the second it's even remotely possible. Because people are willing to take that risk and pay that price for the so many uncovered faces living inside them.",0,0

BwYPddy_5bk,"I don't know, John. I do agree that cities are great, but it seems a little unfair that so much of our lifestyle comes at the expense of the other life forms on this planet. Does our comfort as a species really justify the damage we've done to the planet?\\n\\nI don't mean to be gloomy or negative. I also love books and the internet and vaccines, and I genuinely don't know what's right in this situation. But I think the question of what human progress costs is something we as a species must think very critically about going forward. Not saying you're not thinking critically, just wanted to put these points out there.\\n\\nAlso, congrats to Hank on the book! I'm super excited :D",0,0
BwYPddy_5bk,"There is a really good phrase the late Hans Rosling used to use in his clases to break the stereotype of idealized pre-agricultural or even pre-modern societies: Ancient humans didn't live in harmony with nature, they died in harmony with nature.

BwYPddy_5bk,"Well, I am an Archaeology major and in my semi-professional opinion(not really I'm a student), it really depends on where in the world you are. For Europe I would look to London, one of the first proper cities in the world and what drove people there I would argue (from my limited knowledge) was the sectioning off of the agricultural land and by maximizing production those feudal lords were literally kicking people off so the lords could maximise production. There is actually a stark difference between the field layouts before and after this happened.This drove people on a massive scale towards the urban landscape. For the middle east, possibly congregation near water sources, like the Nile. Sorry, I just studied agriculture not state formation in the middle east. For Asia... I'm going to just stick with China and point towards the either the Xia dynasty or the Shang Dynasty for first cities, possibly Anyang? It was the capital of the late Shang. But China is so old that you could argue that the Liangzhu Culture had a city. And one strong argument suggested was the over-exploitation of the environment by agriculture led to the deterioration of the ecosystem and so this forced people into complex socio-economic strategies. I'm not too sure for the Americas, I have yet to study these regions, sorry. \\nTL:DR People were either forced or they saw the benefits of being near a river and just kinda stayed there.

BwYPddy_5bk,"I thought the obvious answer was that agriculture is more predictable than hunting and gathering.  If you have a largish community supported by a bunch of farmers all growing different crops on different parcels of nearby land, most of the things that can go wrong there are not going to cause an existential-level famine.  A small hunter-gatherer band, on the other hand, is much higher variance — sure, there are good years where you bring down the megafauna easily and have plenty of time left over for monkey-politics and scoodilypooping, but when the megafauna go extinct because humans are just too damn good at hunting them, or when one hunting expedition goes badly wrong and all the tribe's males suffer crippling injuries and can't hunt any more, that tribe suddenly doesn't have any more descendants.\\n(Herding also scores pretty well on this keep variance down metric, since a flock of animals is a store of food that — unlike grain — doesn't rot and can walk.  But it doesn't scale up as well as agriculture, unless you are the Mongols.)",0,0

Like, I have tons of opinions, and I believe very little, but here is something I believe: life is about people. I mean this very broadly, as in you will never really escape the central theme of life that is the people that live within it, around you. Your happiness is never completely independent of the existence and status of others. Existence is partly the awareness of other existence's and dealing with that in any way you do; and even if it isn't, that's what we do anyways because it's hardwired in our genes. Either way, the most interesting thing to most people will always be people, most of the time. So, cities form the second it's even remotely possible. Because people are willing to take that risk and pay that price for the so many uncovered faces living inside them.",0,0

I also love books and the internet and vaccines, and I genuinely don't know what's right in this situation.

Tm8LGxTLtQk,"Those videos of Chester from the early 2000's hit me super hard.Those were my childhood years. That was the time period that I discovered Linkin Park. I went through many shit situations growing up. From being bullied at school to even being abused in my own home. Following up to my teen years, I dealt with self hatred/harm and thoughts of suicide. However, Linkin Park has always been a gateway for me to let go of my angst and aggression with albums like Hybrid Theory and Meteora, up to relaxation with albums like Minutes To Midnight and A Thousand Suns. Their studio diaries, documentaries, and moment compilations never failed to entertain me. They were my shit growing up. Mike and Chester's messages speak to me on so many personal levels, and sometimes I feel horrible for being so caught up on relating their messages to my own problems, without being aware that one of my heroes wasn't doing too well himself either. I even remember wanting to be just like Linkin Park when I started getting into being in bands at the age of 11 and always trying to mimic their style(I was only a kid and had very little knowledge about music). I really looked up to these guys and till this day I still do. Maybe not to mimic their sound like I attempted then, but now that I'm 20 years old, these guys are still the main reason I'm doing what I love till this day. They definitely have some influence in what I write. Knowing that Chester is gone is still heart wrenching to me. Nobody deserves to go away like that. It's very unfortunate how our demons find ways to break us.\\n\\nMuch love to Chester, his family, as well as Mike, Brad, Joe, Dave and Rob. I love you all and keep up the great work. I'm sure Chester would be proud of you all for staying strong.",0,0

Tm8LGxTLtQk,Dam my heart right now is just broken and I know many others feel the same way but god every time I listen to this song it just gives me chills and makes me cry to see another legend pass away into the consuming darkness of depression. Chester was the most inspirational musician I have ever listened to and to see him sadly take his own life hurts me and I know again I'm not the only one but god I remember when me and my bros did a talent show for him when hybrid theory came out it was great. And the worst part I never gtg to any of his concerts and that just hurts me the most because I was planning on going but after I heard the news I just broke down. Chester where ever you are and if you some how see this I hope you rest easy friend and we all thank you for your talented beautiful voice. May you rock in paradise bro 🤘.

BwYPddy_5bk,"Yuval Noah Harari discusses this question a fair bit in his book Sapiens. He points out the same disadvantages of agriculture vs. hunter-gatherer. Hunter gathering does have one major disadvantage, though; you need a lot more land per person. He comes to conclusion that agricultural societies can support so many more people (and organize their behavior much more effectively) that hunter-gathering got crowded out.\\n\\nAnd think of it today. How much land would a small band of, say, thirty people need if they were going to avoid cultivation entirely and just live off of the excess production of the ecosystem? And how bad would their WiFi be?",0,0

BwYPddy_5bk,"This is what I think:\\n\\nIn evolution, even when there is any type of change, nature is likely to sustain that change for a short amount of time as long as the organism is still viable. This means that even if a change decreases your chances of survival (and subsequent propagation), the change will still happen. Only since others have more chance of survival, they will have a competitive advantage and will sooner or later outcompete the changed organism, meaning the change fades. The opposite will of course happen when the change gives a competitive advantage.\\n\\nHowever, there are also changes that at first decrease chances of survival and propagation (e.g. agriculture without proper knowledge and selection of species that will enhance human life), that will later on give larger chances of survival (e.g. agriculture after obtaining proper knowledge and selection of species, and subsequent specialization of other people such as doctors and house builders). These changes mean that the adaption of the change might be more troublesome than one that gives a clear and instantaneous advantage, but due to the fact that it is likely to persist for some time, there is a chance  that enough time will pass to enter the next phase where it is advantageous.\\n\\nFor agriculture this means that there were likely many civilizations that failed (as we know there were) before a permanent one took hold. Getting to that permanent hold, is just a matter of statistics.",0,0

BwYPddy_5bk,at school I've learned that in the middle ages after the urban-agriculture went back to agriculture and most cities disappeared in Europe most farmers didn't own the land they worked on.

BwYPddy_5bk,"Although I love going camping, (cooking and dishwashing is actually /fun/ outside!) I always find myself missing the city. Not so much the bathrooms, or the inside, or even the wifi - just the the way it looks and feels to be there, with so many other people. I spent probably the longest time I've ever spent camping away from the lights, glass, and concrete of a city this summer - it was just over a week - and founding myself sighing in relief and contentment when we finally approached the scattered white, red, green and blue lights of the city, glowing against dark concrete and a dark sky. For once, I actually found it beautiful.",0,0
BwYPddy_5bk,"It's not that hunter gathering was replaced overnight by cities. Like with all evolution, cities are able to withstand changes and adapt to them. Without cities in the mix, hunter gatherers just died like all animals do. Infanticide was high because there were no shelters or medical advances. With a city in place, nomads in dire straits suddenly had a place to go where they might not be welcome but hopefully their dying child would be and would have a chance their adults did not. Those children would grow up to be city dwellers. One less hunter gatherer. That's evolution. It's like white and black moths living in forests with dark barked trees. The white moths are more likely to be eaten by predators while black moths can hide better. After awhile darker moths flourish while lighter shades of moths have less chance of living long enough to breed. Unfortunately, lighter moths didn't have a way to become darker moths, like nomads could opt to become urban dwellers. With the stats John offers, it looks like living in cities is rougher, but there are other variables that nomads face regarding scarcity of supplies, the inability to save resources for when times get tough, literally living off the land which may experience drought or other problems. Stable shelter makes a big difference with regards to survival, even if it takes more work hours to preserve that steady place.",0,0

BwYPddy_5bk,"Well, I am an Archaeology major and in my semi-professional opinion(not really I'm a student), it really depends on where in the world you are. For Europe I would look to London, one of the first proper cities in the world and what drove people there I would argue (from my limited knowledge) was the sectioning off of the agricultural land and by maximizing production those feudal lords were literally kicking people off so the lords could maximise production. There is actually a stark difference between the field layouts before and after this happened.This drove people on a massive scale towards the urban landscape. For the middle east, possibly congregation near water sources, like the Nile. Sorry, I just studied agriculture not state formation in the middle east. For Asia... I'm going to just stick with China and point towards the either the Xia dynasty or the Shang Dynasty for first cities, possibly Anyang? It was the capital of the late Shang. But China is so old that you could argue that the Liangzhu Culture had a city. And one strong argument suggested was the over-exploitation of the environment by agriculture led to the deterioration of the ecosystem and so this forced people into complex socio-economic strategies. I'm not too sure for the Americas, I have yet to study these regions, sorry. \\nTL:DR People were either forced or they saw the benefits of being near a river and just kinda stayed there.

BwYPddy_5bk,"I thought the obvious answer was that agriculture is more predictable than hunting and gathering.  If you have a largish community supported by a bunch of farmers all growing different crops on different parcels of nearby land, most of the things that can go wrong there are not going to cause an existential-level famine.  A small hunter-gatherer band, on the other hand, is much higher variance — sure, there are good years where you bring down the megafauna easily and have plenty of time left over for monkey-politics and scoodilypooping, but when the megafauna go extinct because humans are just too damn good at hunting them, or when one hunting expedition goes badly wrong and all the tribe's males suffer crippling injuries and can't hunt any more, that tribe suddenly doesn't have any more descendants.\\n(Herding also scores pretty well on this keep variance down metric, since a flock of animals is a store of food that — unlike grain — doesn't rot and can walk.  But it doesn't scale up as well as agriculture, unless you are the Mongols.)",0,0

ciXIdvfejn4,You should prank your husband and fill the bag with potatoes (up to the same weight) so the next time he is with Aria and tries to take something from the bag he will be confused.

We definitely had questions on what to put in the diaper bag the first time we packed it. Just like you guys, we like to keep things to a minimum of what we need to carry. I like the style of your bag a lot. We've got the kind of classic duffel-style bag, but I think once Ellie gets a little older, we'll end up switching to something like yours.

In fact, I'd say at least in our part of SD it was rare to find mommies using a nursing cover.  Now when we moved up to the Miracle Mile in LA I gotta say I would feel weird breastfeeding in front of some of the scary homeless people or in a super crowded area.

The only thing western governments are concern about in Saudi Arabia is how to distroy the Saudi family system by forcing Women to leave their homes and kids. Making Saudi women poorer is the key to force them to find jobs and face the hardship that only men are required to face in Islam. So, when the small org. “family” fails the bigger org. “Society” will fail. When women do their essential duty at home, they help the society by making successful husband and kids.",0,0

UkMZJrbCRdQ,"Perm crops won't work with the current system because of seeds. Companies own them, the dna of them, and sell them every year to farmers who aren't allowed to collect seeds from the crop but have to rebuy them from the company again. These companies won't want to give up a yearly cash flow by having farmers perhaps go many years between purchases.",0,0
UkMZJrbCRdQ,Masanobu Fukuoka and many others have already been preaching this kind of farming for the last 50 years... nothing futuristic about it. We (the western world) just forgot that nature gives us everything we need to survive if we allow it to be itself.,0,0

UkMZJrbCRdQ,This will drive up veggie and fruit prices even more.,0,0
UkMZJrbCRdQ,"Only way this works is if all other jobs become automated and every family owns a few acres of land to grow their own food on. Harvesting food in this system is incredibly labor intensive or uses machines that are still in prototype phases that have a starting cost around a million dollars. Also if wild animals are going to be roaming around where you're going your food, you will have significantly less food, unless you have some really good fences. The current system is flawed for sure, no one would argue it isn't, but this will not be a viable solution in our lifetime.",0,0
UkMZJrbCRdQ,Why not just kill off four or five billion people?  This hippie nonsense won't be able to raise enough food to feed the current population let alone any increase over the next 500 years.  The same with hydroponics.  You simply cannot raise enough food to feed the world's population.  Don't get me started on the amount of energy required to run a hydroponics farm.  \n\nThe bottom line is always the bottom line.  Modern farming methods were resisted by oldtimers until it was shown to increase a farmer's profit each and every year.  Why doesn't this Land Institute just start their method of farming and prove that a) it can raise enough food and b) is profitable for the farmer?  Farming is hard work.  The people that whine about paying a McDonald's unskilled employee $15 an hour seem to forget that the people that feed us deserve to make a decent profit to compensate them for that labor.  I seriously doubt they can back up their talk with real performance.,0,0

UkMZJrbCRdQ,"LOL are any of you farmers? Lets be real here, farmers are in it for one thing, and that is money! Lots of Crops = Lots of Money! So by making perennial plants grow side by side to somthing means a smaller yeild which means less money which means that no farmers will join in on this. I understand our resources are depeleting and I would know since i live above the ogalla aquifer, but money is everything and only government regulation can stop the farmers. But then here comes the corruption of representatives and how they will not pass a law like that because they are getting their money and support from big farming companies and guilds.

UkMZJrbCRdQ,"It's staggering to think that we use herbicides to control weeds when we have so many unemployed people in the world.

UkMZJrbCRdQ,Sadly this will be slow to take hold.

Not saying it isn't a great idea, just saying it ain't feasible at this point. Not sure if they've noticed but creating thriving self-replenishing eco-systems is really, really hard and keeping a precise balance that maximizes our food output against competition from the symbiotic flora and fauna, as well as pest species, would be a whole new kind of complicated and labor intensive on a large scale. Upside is it would probably create a lot of unskilled jobs in the agricultural sector as it would make the high volume use of pesticides and herbicides nigh impossible due to the risk of harming the species that you want to keep around, meaning you will need people out there targeting specific problem areas until we can replace them with drones.

UkMZJrbCRdQ,"Current farming techniques are seriously damaging to the environment, sure. But the problem we face is that any proposed replacement technique will need to produce an equal or greater amount of food within the same time-frame, or huge numbers of people will starve to death. I've seen lots of neat, eco-friendly ideas talked about, but many of them just can't guarantee that they'll be worth the investment of time and resources they would require. We can't afford the death-toll that would result if we changed the systems we know will keep us fed, only for the new idea to fall short. Unfortunately this is a problem that is likely to remain with us for a long time. Looking to nature for ideas is great, but the environment doesn't produce the amount of food we need naturally. The real issue is that Humanity seems to have grown beyond nature's capacity.",0,0

The low wages of many households force the majority of the population to purchase the factory farmed goods. Unless you are advocating a return to slavery, i don't see how this could work.

UkMZJrbCRdQ,"This has some very nice ideas in it but only relying on the fact of making perennials is very unrealistic.  \\n\\nLook at alfalfa. It is naturally a perennial and has many qualities that help it survive more then one year. Including the fact that it slowly digs its stem deeper into the soil to save it from damaging temperatures in the winter. Though alfalfa is adapted to growing like this, every two years you need to dig it up and plant new crops. After the first year only 80% survive to grow the next year. Each year at last 20% of the crop will not grow. After three years you would have around 30-50% of the original crop making it highly unrealistic to have in the long run. \\n\\nWhen you make crops perennial after they are annual they have even more problems than  this.  Though the idea is nice, Agriculture has been fine turning the process of farming for a long time.  Variety between farmers and crops is a necessity.

We do that not because corn feeding is cheaper, but because people want that fat, juicy cows and don't like the taste of grass fed cows. Based on your explanation, simple grass feeding solves every problem. Grass holds the soil by itself. It stays in the ground and regenerates when cows eat the top layer of the grass. Cows shit on the grass, giving it natural fertilization. We don't do whole lot of grass feeding cows because it takes longer to fatten and people love that juicy, fattened beef full of white stuff in it.",0,0

GSxeF68FRsk,"So many asking the same questions of us over, and over and over so to simplify things here are the most popular questions and the answers:\\n\\n1.  Do you believe racism is a problem in this country?  Absolutely.  Are you a racist, white supremacist? Short answer, no.  We are totally outraged with the KKK, White Supremacists and Nazis.  How wrong they are is immeasurable and they need to stop the hatred.  Everyone, can't we all just get along?  Famous quote.  Any protester that spews violence and harm to another human being is wrong or how destroys property or shouts down someone speaking on a public forum.  Heated debate is one thing, hated debate is another.  Who can change their thinking?  But again that is freedom of speech and where do we as a nation draw the line?  Right now the line is if you physically assault, kill or stalk someone or destroy property.  If we get into the weeds with words being a crime we are in big trouble, but I do have a huge problem with death threats and threats of violence being called freedom of speech.   Just my thoughts.\\n\\n2. Are you against protesting for equal rights for any minority?  No absolutely not.  It is just the time and place.  There is a way to protest without disrespecting our United States and those who serve.  You can not protest in a public school, or place of employment, and if you are currently active duty in the military you can not protest or even have a political opinion.\\n2a.  A possible solution: If we can not agree there has to be compromise.  Why not after the games when their work is done for the day, then they could even invite patrons to join them on the field and really make the movement for peace and equality grow and organize help for the those in need, education, training etc.  \\n\\n3. Why didn't you sell the clothes, why didn't help the homeless with them instead?  Looking back, it would have never brought any light to this issue, and we do help the homeless, hurricane victims, and those in need.  It is part of our life.  It is not about the money...we love this country more than money.   Once we even picked up a homeless person hitchhiking, brought them home.  After the layers of filthy men's clothing was gone and a hot shower we found out this was a beautiful young 17 year old girl from Oklahoma who was a run away.  We though she was a homeless man, you honestly could not tell.  She ate dinner with us and spent the night at our home, the next day we talked in depth to her about her life and her story.  We talked to her about going back home, she cried and thought she would not have been welcome.  We insisted that she call her mother.  Her mother told her please come home.  We bought her bus ticket and sent her home a day later.  She kept in touch with us for months after that and got her life back.  This just a little bit of who we are.\\n\\n4. So you approve of police officers killing innocent people?  Never.  I have a monumental problem with police killing people, without their own lives or lives of others being in danger.  I can not believe all the assuming going on.  All races of officers in this nation have killed people, and I mourn their loss and the loss of police officers rightly doing their job to protect us.  I do not want to shut down peaceful protest...and I agree race relations have to be repaired.  The NFL is not the place, especially when we gather to sing the National Anthem in our opinion.  Taking a knee has not feed, educated or saved anyone.  How about this,  put some feet on their faith and invest their time, name and money  to actually produce help for those in need, as some players and teams do on a small scale compared to what they could do.  There are over 1000 players in the NFL, if they all got together and contributed $250,000 a year each toward education family services and food that would go a long way and a protest could turn into a nation changing movement to benefit all.  If they all gave one hour a week to being a mentor like a big brother to the children of this nation who's fathers are MIA, and paid for kids college that would be a great start.  Never violent protests. \\n\\n5.  Why did you bring God into it?  This was not planned and was made in the heat of the moment.  This was the first and only time Robert ever made a video and posted it online.  He can not hide who he is and what he believes and people should not ask him to do so.\\n\\n6. How dare you tell us we have to be Christian to be American, and demand us to do so and pray for us, you are wrong:  This was just strong passionate encouragement and a reminder to those who do believe and want to believe to be strong in their belief and receive our love and support.  If you are not a believer and don't want to be one no big whoop, just change the channel.  It is not wrong for us to believe in God strongly and say so publicly...or Un-American to be a Christian and hope and pray for others salvation (eternal safety and well being).  We never intended to offend, we were just hoping to be heard on some small scale.\\n\\n7. Why are you contradicting yourself 2:3?  He is not, he had a hard time getting the words out and words he wanted to say were unintentionally omitted.  If you have eyes you can see that.  We did not want to write a script and practice it and edit it for public consumption.  We wanted it to be real.  What he tried to say was: You don't get to disrespect our soldiers (without hearing from the public anymore), you have crossed the line (the general line of decency) is what he is saying.  \\n\\n8. Why we did it?  Like I said we had enough, and never in a million years thought it would get more than 100 views.  We did it for our Family of Veterans & Active Duty Military and Public Safety Officers in support of them.  As you can tell I could hardly even film it properly, total novices with social media.",5,2
GSxeF68FRsk,"So how do you feel about the neo-nazis that still exist in this country and the events in Charlottesville? Neo-nazis live by the ideas such as racism/nazi ideology which has led to the millions of Americans dying in wars to protect America... yet Donald trump takes forever to tweet against them and denounce them. Yet, here he is, tweeting/hating on the NFL players who are protesting him/police brutality. Is neo-nazism/racism honestly MORE disrespectful to the flag then someone kneeling?!?!?!",2,3

What Say You America?\\n\\nHey America, our voices are being heard.  The namby-pamby anti-American NFL is spreading propaganda that they are doing even better.  Lie.  Their anti-American attitude is hitting them hard in their bank accounts!  Keep fighting them.  The NFL is not more important to Americans than the country we live in.  They have betrayed this awesome nation and it's time they eat humble pie and hunt for jobs.\\n\\nI just learned the NFL is listed as a Non-Profit Organization.   With players making an average of $2 million each and the owners are multi-millionaires, please explain how that is not PROFIT.  ???  silence\\n\\nWhy is the American Tax Payer funding nearly 45% of the cost of the fancy football stadiums for the players to give America the Proverbial Finger?  Talk about biting the hand that feeds you!!!!  NFL Hypocrites!\\n\\nIn case you didn't know, could the Owners fire them? Yes, they can for violating the Regulations of the game.  Feel Free To Read The Regulations:  The specific rule pertaining to the national anthem is found on pages A62-63 of the league rulebook. It states:\\n\\nThe National Anthem must be played prior to every NFL game, and all players must be on the sideline for the National Anthem.\\n\\nDuring the National Anthem, players on the field and bench area should stand at attention, face the flag, hold helmets in their left hand, and refrain from talking. The home team should ensure that the American flag is in good condition. It should be pointed out to pla.yers and coaches that we continue to be judged by the public in this area of respect for the flag and our country. Failure to be on the field by the start of the National Anthem may result in discipline, such as fines, suspensions, and/or the forfeiture of draft choice(s) for violations of the above, including first offenses.\\n\\nSo why don't we hear You're Fired by the Owners?  GREED.  \\nThey love the money, so to hell with America, our Military, the National Anthem, the Flag and the American People.  The NFL and many of it's players are above the Nation.  That is the NFL Attitude.\\n\\nThe NFL is convinced Americans love them more than the country they live in and the ones that bled and died to protect it.\\nWhat Say You America?

So it served a niche of upper class individuals, and eventually retired without turning much of a profit.

Upside is it would probably create a lot of unskilled jobs in the agricultural sector as it would make the high volume use of pesticides and herbicides nigh impossible due to the risk of harming the species that you want to keep around, meaning you will need people out there targeting specific problem areas until we can replace them with drones.

I've seen lots of neat, eco-friendly ideas talked about, but many of them just can't guarantee that they'll be worth the investment of time and resources they would require. We can't afford the death-toll that would result if we changed the systems we know will keep us fed, only for the new idea to fall short.

UkMZJrbCRdQ,"There is a basic arithmetic issue that nobody will address because it hurts feelings. Perenial grains and such are cool and all but permaculture simply cannot sustain the current population, their is a basic limit to the rates of the nitrogen and phosphorous cycles. Resources are being depleted simply because the current population is not sustainable and we require maximum production per acre. The earth has about 5 billion people more than can be maintained at the current first world standard of living, we only get away with this level in the short term by using up our long term savings.\\nOn top of that there are major process engineering issues around mixed crops. Hand labor is not compatible with improved living conditions. The ability to batch process provides a major means of controlling diseases and pests in a field. \\nMaybe when it finally becomes acceptable to acknowledge that not all opinions are valid or deserving of respect society can make some progress. It will likely be a day late and a dollar short however. Simply put not all people should have the right to have kids, and being anti-birth control is logically equal to advocating for children to starve to death in a few generations. Now there are fools that think they will end resource scarcity via various methods, yet even at that fanciful extreme end(and ignoring the limit of light speed) it would only be 8000 years at the current pop growth rate before every particle in the current observable universe is part of a human body.",0,0

Upside is it would probably create a lot of unskilled jobs in the agricultural sector as it would make the high volume use of pesticides and herbicides nigh impossible due to the risk of harming the species that you want to keep around, meaning you will need people out there targeting specific problem areas until we can replace them with drones.

We can't afford the death-toll that would result if we changed the systems we know will keep us fed, only for the new idea to fall short.

zqE-ultsWt0,"Sorry, but noise will be a major problem that will make rocket passenger travel impractical.   The BFR makes 12 million pounds of thrust at liftoff.   The Saturn-V was only 7.5 million pounds of thrust, and it was the loudest man-made object except for atomic bombs.   The first time they tested the Saturn-V they blew out windows miles away in downtown Huntsville.   The sound level is to the FOURTH POWER of the exhaust velocity -- that's why jets are so loud, and why supersonic jets are louder, and why rockets are the loudest of them all -- rockets must have exhaust velocity many times the speed of sound.\\n\\nThe deafening sound is why they'll only be able to launch BFR from launch pads that are tens or hundreds of miles away from people (and that's assuming the environmentalists don't keep it tied up in court because of the wildlife it will kill).   After you add the time to/from the launch pads to the half-hour to an hour of flight time, the total flight time will be several hours.",0,1

That's a million dollar one way ticket to start and the price will never drop below a few hundred thousand dollars. If this were main stream global warming will accelerate at a new brake neck pace. It is an existential threat to national security because the ballistic trajectory and speed of re-entry is so fast, any meaningful defensive measure has fractions of a second to intercept. This will never be mainstream, and if your net worth is south of 9 figures right now, you can expect to have a harder life because of the 9 figure assholes trying to squeeze out a little more from the rest of us.",1,1

It was a fitting hommage which paid respect to a great artist and is another example of celebrating George Michael's music and keeping his songs and memory alive.

The earth has about 5 billion people more than can be maintained at the current first world standard of living, we only get away with this level in the short term by using up our long term savings.\\nOn top of that there are major process engineering issues around mixed crops. Hand labor is not compatible with improved living conditions. The ability to batch process provides a major means of controlling diseases and pests in a field. \\nMaybe when it finally becomes acceptable to acknowledge that not all opinions are valid or deserving of respect society can make some progress.

UkMZJrbCRdQ,"The key to more efficient and environmentally-friendly farming is (and always has been) technology.\\nThere is a misconception among non-farmers that 'organic' farming has less of an environmental impact, when the opposite is true. The ability to get amazing yields using less land, less equipment, and less diesel is why technology is so important to agriculture, especially sustainable agriculture.\\nWhen people rally against safe and proven agricultural technology such as GMO's, they aren't just trying to make agriculture less efficient; they are inadvertently making it harder to feed the world and save the environment.",0,0

Your suggestion that the whole (farming) world simply give up their trade and move on...is about as condescending as my suggesting you take a deep breath and consider the livelihood of billions of people across, erm, planet Earth. A (very well researched!) scientific approach to global issues is indeed brilliant but the way you point it out suggests a this is fact, therefore you change approach. Your ideas work in theory, just as farmers own realities work for them, in practicality. Try analysing wealth distribution - if you really want to rock the world :)",0,0

The truth of the matter is that there will NEVER be true everlasting peace on this earth until Christ comes back to reign. No matter how hard they try to create peace, it will never happen during this lifetime. Also remember, God is a loving God and he is also a God of judgement. This nation is at its last stand. I firmly believe this nation is the Mystery Babylon the Bible speaks of and judgement is right around the corner. It only makes sense really. Everything in this nation is pagan all the way from the holidays we celebrate and back to this nations founding. We were not founded upon Christianity like we were told. The freemasons/pagans are the ones who set this nation up. I'm not saying that there wasn't Christians that helped during the founding of this nation but again, we were founded and set up upon paganism. Repent and be saved now while you can be. Only Jesus can forgive sins and by Him only can you be saved. He shed His blood for you and me. God bless.",1,0

zqE-ultsWt0,"Sorry, but noise will be a major problem that will make rocket passenger travel impractical.   The BFR makes 12 million pounds of thrust at liftoff.   The Saturn-V was only 7.5 million pounds of thrust, and it was the loudest man-made object except for atomic bombs.   The first time they tested the Saturn-V they blew out windows miles away in downtown Huntsville.   The sound level is to the FOURTH POWER of the exhaust velocity -- that's why jets are so loud, and why supersonic jets are louder, and why rockets are the loudest of them all -- rockets must have exhaust velocity many times the speed of sound.\\n\\nThe deafening sound is why they'll only be able to launch BFR from launch pads that are tens or hundreds of miles away from people (and that's assuming the environmentalists don't keep it tied up in court because of the wildlife it will kill).

It is an existential threat to national security because the ballistic trajectory and speed of re-entry is so fast, any meaningful defensive measure has fractions of a second to intercept.

There so few character-centric series out there with LIKEABLE characters. And even less that take the time to create the feeling of watching something new every week. The idea of these characters I like, traveling to different places and visiting all new people is just wonderful. The fact they keep throwing these big name actors on the show doesn't matter to me one bit. The fact they keep building on these great characters is what makes me come back each week. I can't wait to see more and I really hope this show continues far into the future.",3,1

We all need that variety in our life or we go insane. Just like all these nuts who go on rampages. My heart and prayers go out to all the victims and there families in Las Vegas. I'm sorry for your loss. Lets all spread the word of love, abolish hatred. No law strong or weak will protect us from haters such as the ones who go on rampages. We never know when someone is going to attack. Yet people hate others who have a felony. None of the attacks that have ever happened involved a felon. After the fact they were of course.

Grow up and stop spreading mistruths and/or lies. The only person to blame for anything is the person who pulled the trigger of the weapon.,1,1

Granted, there are so many freaking atmosphere polluting aircraft on this planet spewing their poisonous chemical waste material into our atmosphere, that it affects our planet's weather...massively. Did you know that for the few days that all aircraft flights around the world were grounded after the inside terrorist attack by Dick Cheney and Paul Wolfowitz and their cabal, that the earth's atmospheric temperatures dropped almost two degrees fahrenheit? Can you imagine if the people of this planet decided to ban commercial...well...and industrial...and well...military flights altogether, what a wonderfully clean atmosphere our planet would have? That being said, what sort of effects would Mr. Musk's multiple daily rocket flights add to our planet's atmosphere? How would those pollutants affect our atmosphere and life in general? Shouldn't we be more focused on applying zero-point energy applications (and research...duh) to solving our planet's transportation problems, rather than resorting to just another form of atmospheric pollution? I really like Elon Musk. He is a forward-thinking [businessman is the key word here] human being who has some interesting ideas.

zqE-ultsWt0,"THIS VIDEO IS SCIENTIFICALLY WRONG. READ FOR EXPLANATION.\\n\\nSince most people won't read a text of wall, here are the main points that prevent this failed process to transport people.\\n1.Fuel alone costs 2 million dollars to store and maintaining them . And no Elon Musk cannot discover a new method, its physics it can't be changed we are already using the most efficient chemical fuels.\\n2.Astronomically high failure rates and the added procedure to land the rocket has only increased trouble so its most likely that every 1 in a 100th plane will crash, this number could increase due to unknowns interrupting weather, re-entry problems etc.\\n3.The last and the most important people who would pay about 250k to 1 mil with risk of dying just to save about 18 hours at max because this process won't take 30 mins the travel time of rocket is 30 min, you cannot keep a rocket filled with fuel as its too dangerous fulling takes time about 2 hours, plus the regular checks 1 hour more (or you can risk a potential explosion), last and the dumbest is the rocket won't land in a city or area near it, as it is too dangerous and noisy (by that I mean deafening loudness) thus getting 1 hour more added to the destination. Now the best part, building stations to house this rocket in only 7 parts i.e the continents would cost more than 2 billion dollars (cost of only the reusable materials ) and a maintenance cost of 50 mil per anum at each station. Just think if all the major cities where people would like to visit i.e all the major capitals of most countries so you will have around 30 of these stations because they don't reach your destination then whats the point.So even with lowered maintenance cost $10 billion will be required just to build the fuel storage, landing pad, and the rocket.\\n\\nThe real question is not if it's possible, almost anything is. The real question is do we want such a system in which even after spending heaps of money and risking lives be worthful to our time. Hopefully some people remember the concord.\\nSO, I DO HOPE THE PEOPLE WILL USE GOOGLE AND HOPEFULLY FIGURE IT OUT BY THEMSELVES. BEFORE ACCUSING ME AND DOWNVOTING THIS ANSWER PLEASE BE AWARE.",2,3
zqE-ultsWt0,"This has to be the one of the dumbest fucking ideas I have ever seen. The flaws in this plan are so obvious, how the hell did the SpaceX team not immediately scrap this idea once they noticed them?",0,2
zqE-ultsWt0,So you want to put these things on a launch pad near heavily populated cities and fill them with fuel... Musk you're supposed to be a canadian are you not familiar with the halifax explosion? Cause you have a high chance of recreating that if one of these malfunctions and either explodes on the pad or crashed into the city full of fuel. Not to mention the sheer cost of fuel to launch them and how much pollution burning liquid or solid fuel would produce. Why don't you start with a mass driver get things into space without burning fuel. As for earth travel i think it would probably be more economically viable to work on transporters than rockets not that either are likely to become a viable mode of transport.,0,2

And while I know every celebrity has his/her own baggage and is well within their right say what/how they feel, Carrey is now coming off as not just a narcassist, but a complete sociopath.

You know the truth and it has set you free but not everyone knows the truth.  Be patient with everyone, give them time and just love them.

Let them  know you love them unconditionally.   \\n\\nDear Heavenly Father, You conquer all situations with Love, sometimes it is a hug, sometimes it is truth, sometimes it is unexpected kindness.  I thank You for loving me even when I continue to sin.  Strengthen my resolve today to control my tongue.  Continue to spread your message of love even in the pain of situations.   Bless this day with joy, give us peace in all trials and allow us to turn to you in our moments of grieve so you can breath love back into us.

And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will (((come again))), and (((receive you))) (((unto myself))); that where I am, there ye may be also).\\n\\nthat shall come to pass,\\nand to stand before\\nthe Son of man.\\n\\n(Watch...pray): Jesus encouraged his disciples to be persistent in prayer and faith, looking for the day when the Son of Man exonerates the faithful in the judgment, so that they are able to stand before him.\\n\\n***(1 John 2:28)<---And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him at his coming.\\n\\n***(John 3:2)<---Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.\\n\\n(Luke 21:34-36).\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n (REPENTANCE):\\n\\n(Greek. Metanoia); Strong's #3341; This Greek word is a compound word derived from meta, meaning after and suggesting some type of change, and nous, meaning mind. \\nThus the word strictly denotes a change of mind.\\nBut it also connotes remorse for sin, accompanied by a desire to turn away from one's sin, to God, for salvation.\\nBoth John the Baptist and Jesus began their ministries with a call to repentance. (See Matthew 3:2, 4:17)---A call that many of the social outcasts and sinners of that day answered, (See Luke 19:1-10),\\nbut that the religious people rejected. (Luke 11:39-44; 18:9-14).",0,0

yBt9zuvZxIc,The most stupid/ridiculous sci-fi movie ever. This is not how cloning works. I know this because my social circle includes top geneticists from the BGI Shenzhen. You can't just clone an adult/fully developed human being. If you clone an organism the subject starts at 0 ergo as an undeveloped human being (baby). By the time that organism reaches the desired age you'll be a grandpa.\nDo you even science?! I think not.,1,3

As we grow closer to God, situations around us impact us differently.  Maybe a situation in the past that wouldn’t bother you now does.  You know the truth and it has set you free but not everyone knows the truth.  Be patient with everyone, give them time and just love them.  This is what Jesus did, He even carried all our burdens on the cross.  So replace those burdens with the strength of Christ.   Have a blessed day and pray for each other.  Let them  know you love them unconditionally.   \\n\\nDear Heavenly Father, You conquer all situations with Love, sometimes it is a hug, sometimes it is truth, sometimes it is unexpected kindness.  I thank You for loving me even when I continue to sin.  Strengthen my resolve today to control my tongue.  Continue to spread your message of love even in the pain of situations.   Bless this day with joy, give us peace in all trials and allow us to turn to you in our moments of grieve so you can breath love back into us.  I ask this in Your most holy name, Jesus Christ.  \\n\\nMary, Mother of Love, pray for us.  \\n\\nhttps://youtu.be/tUPR5-igTVY\\n\\n\\n\\nwww.dailythoughts.com\\n\\nYBIC\\n\\n1 John 4:4b\\nThe One that is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.",0,0

NheUm_izr6A,"Want to know for sure that you are going to Heaven when you die? (and everyone dies)  \\n\\nJesus is the Son of the Living GOD.  The only true GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth and there can only be ONE God that actually created everything, not many... \\n\\nJesus Died, was Buried and Rose from the dead on the third day, proving He is GOD.\\n\\nJesus said in John 14:6; Jesus said to him, “I am The Way, The Truth, and The Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.”  NKJV\\n\\nActs 4:12 states; Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name [Jesus] under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.  NKJV\\n\\nJesus said in John 3:16-17; For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world (YOU) that He even gave His One and only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him as Savior shall not perish, but have eternal life.  For God did not send the Son into the world to judge and condemn the world, that is, to initiate the final judgment of the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.  AMP\\n\\nJesus said in John 3:3; I assure you and most solemnly say to you, unless a person is Born Again, reborn from above, spiritually transformed, renewed, sanctified, he cannot ever see and experience the kingdom of God.  AMP\\n\\nRomans 10:9-11 states; that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.  NKJV\\n\\nRomans 10:13 states; For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”  NKJV\\n\\n1 Corinthians 15:1-5 states; Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you—unless you believed in vain.  3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ Died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was Buried, and that He Rose Again the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.  NKJV\\n\\nAnd REPENT...\\n\\nActs 17:30 Therefore God overlooked and disregarded the former ages of ignorance; but now He commands all people everywhere to REPENT [that is, to change their old way of thinking, to regret their past sins, and to seek God’s purpose for their lives].  AMP\\n\\nJesus said in Mark 1:15 “The [appointed period of] time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; REPENT [change your inner self—your old way of thinking, regret past sins, live your life in a way that proves REPENTANCE; seek God’s purpose for your life] and believe [with a deep, abiding trust] in the good news [regarding salvation].”  AMP\\n\\n1 John 3:10 In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.  NKJV\\n\\nFrom what I have read we know how 8 of Jesus' disciples died and all 8 of those 8 chose death rather than to simply state that Jesus had not actually rose from the dead, that they were just lying, we made it all up.  Think about that!  Would you ever choose to be murdered to maintain a complete LIE?  No you would not.  You would say “ok, ok, it was a lie”.  They would not deny their Lord to keep this life because they knew they have eternal life in Jesus because they saw Him raised from the dead.\\n\\nPlease get in a quiet and alone place SOON and pray to Jesus that He show you somehow if these things above are true.  If you are sincere, He will answer you…\\n\\nAnd don’t ever forget just as there is a GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth there is also a devil, a Satan that hates God and everything God as ever made and that means he Hates YOU and wants to deceive and trick you into believing ANYTHING except Jesus and His salvation through the cross.  Though we should never fear for God is in complete control even when we have to walk through pain in this life for a season and the devil will soon be forever in his torment and punishment.\\n\\nSome great scriptures to look up and read below:\\n\\n1 Corinthians 6:9-11\\n1 Corinthians 15:1-4\\n1 John 3:7-15\\nMicah 6:8\\nActs 17:3\\nActs 18:5\\nJohn 4:25-26\\nMark 14:61-62\\nRevelation chapters 20-22\\nThe entire New Testament",0,0

NheUm_izr6A,How the fuck is this.not top.#1 trending. Probably because it's not some pop shit from some talentless pop star like shitlor swift mily syres or shitsten beybur or no direction or that girl with the ponytail and the Starbucks last name Ariel grand or whatever. Country stuff never makes the top trending. Last thing talented that got the top trending I can remember wasn't that long ago because it was talented Katy Perry with her great newer song swish swish,0,0

You can't just clone an adult/fully developed human being. If you clone an organism the subject starts at 0 ergo as an undeveloped human being (baby). By the time that organism reaches the desired age you'll be a grandpa.\nDo you even science?! I think not.,1,5

NheUm_izr6A,"Want to know for sure that you are going to Heaven when you die? (and everyone dies)  \\n\\nJesus is the Son of the Living GOD.  The only true GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth and there can only be ONE God that actually created everything, not many... \\n\\nJesus Died, was Buried and Rose from the dead on the third day, proving He is GOD.\\n\\nJesus said in John 14:6; Jesus said to him, “I am The Way, The Truth, and The Life. No one comes to the Father except through Me.”  NKJV\\n\\nActs 4:12 states; Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name [Jesus] under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.  NKJV\\n\\nJesus said in John 3:16-17; For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world (YOU) that He even gave His One and only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him as Savior shall not perish, but have eternal life.  For God did not send the Son into the world to judge and condemn the world, that is, to initiate the final judgment of the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.  AMP\\n\\nJesus said in John 3:3; I assure you and most solemnly say to you, unless a person is Born Again, reborn from above, spiritually transformed, renewed, sanctified, he cannot ever see and experience the kingdom of God.  AMP\\n\\nRomans 10:9-11 states; that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.  NKJV\\n\\nRomans 10:13 states; For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”  NKJV\\n\\n1 Corinthians 15:1-5 states; Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you—unless you believed in vain.  3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ Died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was Buried, and that He Rose Again the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.  NKJV\\n\\nAnd REPENT...\\n\\nActs 17:30 Therefore God overlooked and disregarded the former ages of ignorance; but now He commands all people everywhere to REPENT [that is, to change their old way of thinking, to regret their past sins, and to seek God’s purpose for their lives].  AMP\\n\\nJesus said in Mark 1:15 “The [appointed period of] time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; REPENT [change your inner self—your old way of thinking, regret past sins, live your life in a way that proves REPENTANCE; seek God’s purpose for your life] and believe [with a deep, abiding trust] in the good news [regarding salvation].”  AMP\\n\\n1 John 3:10 In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.  NKJV\\n\\nFrom what I have read we know how 8 of Jesus' disciples died and all 8 of those 8 chose death rather than to simply state that Jesus had not actually rose from the dead, that they were just lying, we made it all up.  Think about that!  Would you ever choose to be murdered to maintain a complete LIE?  No you would not.  You would say “ok, ok, it was a lie”.  They would not deny their Lord to keep this life because they knew they have eternal life in Jesus because they saw Him raised from the dead.\\n\\nPlease get in a quiet and alone place SOON and pray to Jesus that He show you somehow if these things above are true.  If you are sincere, He will answer you…\\n\\nAnd don’t ever forget just as there is a GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth there is also a devil, a Satan that hates God and everything God as ever made and that means he Hates YOU and wants to deceive and trick you into believing ANYTHING except Jesus and His salvation through the cross.  Though we should never fear for God is in complete control even when we have to walk through pain in this life for a season and the devil will soon be forever in his torment and punishment.\\n\\nSome great scriptures to look up and read below:\\n\\n1 Corinthians 6:9-11\\n1 Corinthians 15:1-4\\n1 John 3:7-15\\nMicah 6:8\\nActs 17:3\\nActs 18:5\\nJohn 4:25-26\\nMark 14:61-62\\nRevelation chapters 20-22\\nThe entire New Testament",0,0

yWatz9TAgT0,"Since you have oily skin I recommend using a powder of some sort, you put it on all over your face (or under your eyes & extra oily spots) with a big fluffy brush to set your makeup. It also keeps your makeup from creasing and will stop the shine. I recommend the Maybelline fit me matte \\nand poreless pressed powder or coty airspun translucent loose powder. Both are drug store and work really well! I will say though the coty airspun has a smell that kind of reminds me of a grandma, but I like it and it doesn’t bother me, also the loose powder will last a lot longer than the pressed one.",0,0

yWatz9TAgT0,"A few tips (not that you're doing anything wrong, just if you're interested):\\n\\n1. For your eyebrows, you're doing a fine job! You could try the same product in a lighter color because that is generally more forgiving. Also, I might go a tiny bit lighter on the inner part, closest to your nose (the hairs there are usually more sparse there, so it looks more natural)\\n2. For eye shadow, the general idea is to put a skin color all over the lid (up to your eyebrow). Then a little lower, above the crease, apply a slightly darker transition shade and blend. Then apply a darker shade in the crease and outer V. Do whatever color you want on the lid. That's it! But any colors/techniques work, whatever you like. I find the more important thing is finding good brushes (not expensive, just ones targeted to what you need). I use 2 small fluffy brushes (one to apply eye shadow and one to blend) and one really small brush for the more detailed crease/outer V work. I rarely wash my brushes either ;)\\n3. Eyeliner is always hard! I find that the type of tip and the formula really matter. You have to experiment and find the one that works for you. I like a really thin line, so I like a really long and thin tip. You can also do a pencil eyeliner instead, which might work better for you if it feels more natural in your hand.\\n4. All your face stuff is perfect!",0,0

Not sure of stockists for you as I’m in U.K. but definitely check it out because it has a slight green tinge to it, to combat the redness as well! \\n\\nAlso watch Lisa Eldridge tutorials - she has fantastic ones for redness solutions, easy tutorials, high-street (or drugstore in US) best brands.

yWatz9TAgT0,"I'm that girl who has here eyebrows snatched and have highlight and blush on, and curled lashes but has no foundation or any skin product, not even moisturiser, only because I don't like face products, and like everything else. And I don't wear mascara cause I wear glasses. 😂 also, I do eyeshadow & liner only when I feel like it. Maybe if you mixed ur foundation you could get a good shade? Remember to always dab with your sponge, instead of rubbing or hitting your face too fast, cause that won't blend the makeup well, and would give you wrinkles faster!! 😜 laughing real hard because you didn't blend your concealer on your Cupid's bow. Try to tap away excess powder instead of blowing because that gives it more germs which isn't good for your skin. And be more gentle when putting on your eyeshadow!! If you think your eyeliner is wobbly, put your pinky against your face to give more stability, and rest your elbow on a table.",0,0

It’s really important for you to clean your brushes and sponges, wet beauty sponges absorb more bacteria and it means more acne :( I used to hate doing it and would put it off all the time but dawn dish soap and virgin olive oil mixed together makes an amazing and easy cleanser!

yWatz9TAgT0,"I also have natural red and pink tones to my skin, although they’re not as prominent as yours. You’re on the right track with the color corrector before your foundation, but I would seriously think about investing in fuller coverage foundation. If you’re not comfortable going somewhere like Sephora, Ulta or to a Clinique counter take a look at Boots Number 7 at Target. It’s around $20 a bottle & I personally use two different shades & combine them. So that makes it around $40. I know it seems expensive, but with as much money as you spend on your classroom I think it’s okay if you spend a little on yourself too.",0,0

yWatz9TAgT0,"Tips that have helped me: \\nWhen you’re doing your eyeshadow, use a blending brush and go in tiny circular motions and use a tiny bit of color at a time and just build up to how dark you’d like it to be. Using a darker color for your crease and putting it a little higher than normal will make your eyes look bigger, I’ve seen a few people on here say that! \\nAlso, when you’re contouring on your cheeks, bring the brush UP with each stroke, and when you’re contouring on your head, bring the brush DOWN with each stroke. I’m not sure how much of a difference these little things make, but experimenting is always helpful 😊 your make up always looks really good and you look great without it too.",2,0

oQyKpOJhUKY,Read more on how Rotten Tomatoes works from Vox's Alissa Wilkinson: https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/8/31/16107948/rotten-tomatoes-explainer-critics-movies-aggregation,192,24
oQyKpOJhUKY,This is why you need a toothbrush.,75,6
oQyKpOJhUKY,Ricegum took the L,29,1
oQyKpOJhUKY,"I'm sorry. Is this amateur hour? How can you proclaim you are here to explain everyone how Rotten Tomatoes work, when you completely ignore and don't mention at all the audience score ratings, which for some people, like myself, has a weight of at least 70% on my decision if to watch a movie or not. The Tomatometer part (of the film critics), while very important, is relatively more limited in scope,  and for many people has a smaller weight  than the larger audience score. You can argue with that, but shouldn't you at least mention this score even exist as a second set of rating?",6,2
oQyKpOJhUKY,"I have a good method, maybe watch the movie your damn self and build criticism from there...",0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,You have to be biblically stupid to not watch a movie just because some stranger on the internet gave it a low score. E enjoyed movies with low scores and hated movies with high scores.,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,So you’re basically telling us rotten tomatoes scores may be around 5-6% off of what they should be......then ending it with.... there’s really no better alternative to rotten tomatoes,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,metacritic is a cartel of certified reviewers who are weighted more than others.  Completely distorting the value of most reviews in favour of 4 or 5,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,"I don't bother with Rotten Tomatoes, it's not really a big thing in the UK as far as I'm aware. Wittertainment has all the information I need, wrapped up in a 2 hour weekly podcast.",0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,"I'm glad this exists, people should be aware that Rotten Tomatoes dose not determine a fims quality but what the certified critics think.",0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,Thumbs up just for that song at the end!,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,I usually only rely on the IGN scores; They are the *M O I S T* reliable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n-too much water,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,Metacritic is where its at,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,"Remember when people went to the video store, looked for an interesting movie, and then decided for themselves if they liked it or not. Those days are long gone.",0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,i thought of the psat when i was watching this,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,Suddenly this video became metaphorical just at the end,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,Looks like someone is getting payed big time to defame rotten tomatoes,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,smh i bet u the tomato is a gassed up tomato too. shout out to the psat,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,I never rely on Rotten Tomatoes to help me decide which movie to watch. I read multiple reviews to get an idea of what the movie is about and then decide wherever to watch or not.,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,You just butthurt cause the Emoji Movie got a low score,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,What if you just maybe watched the film and decided if you liked it or not for yourself?,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,It means IMDb is a much better realistic score,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,The only review I need is the moist meter.,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,"I mainly review a movie by it's strengths and weaknesses does it have convincing acting , is it rushed,slow or balanced. Is the story explained well enough or are there plot holes, etc  people tend to be looking for different things when they see a movie",0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,I actually use Jeremy Jhans or Chris Stuckman to base my movie reviews,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,"Rotten Tomatoes is a review aggregator that shows us critical consensus. While it’s a good compass to see whether a film will be successful, it doesn’t tell you whether it’s for you. I’d recommend finding a film critic who’s tastes typically align with yours and keeping an eye on their reviews. A lot of their judgement would make sense to you as their opinion would align consistently with theirs and from there, you can make an informed decision on whether you want to watch a movie or not.",0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,"Why do they cut off at 60%? On a 100 scale, 50 should be the cut off. If it's above 50 that means the majority of reviews were good. 59% is still above average.",0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,0:26. OMG. I remember the flixster app. Best movie app on iOS for a long while.,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,Rotten tomatoes is a joke. Movie critics are literally the worst at judging movies. Often times a certified fresh movie is bloody awful.,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,"I still don’t know what rotten tomatoes, tomatoes, Certified Fresh mean XD",0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,"ratings are all still subjective and all by every individuals opinion. a great rated movie can still be hated by somebody so to me, if you want to watch a movie. just watch it and have your own opinion about it.",0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,"You should do an episode called “Why Vox is such a shitty, biased, racist media outlet that thinks its relevant”.",0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,In the end it’s all up to you if you like a movie,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,"I think an interesting conversation to have is whether Rotten Tomatoes are having an effect on audience reception. I don't think Logan was all that great of a movie, but it's buoyed in my mind by the largely positive Tomatometer. I liked The Wolverine more than Logan, but I find it difficult to tell someone that The Wolverine is better than Logan. Similarly, I liked Wonder Woman, but I do not think it was as good as other superhero films, like The Dark Knight. However, Wonder Woman's positive reception puts it higher for me than Batman Begins and The Dark Knight Rises but under The Dark Knight. I'm not sure that I'm being objective by rating Wonder Woman so (in my subjective opinion).",0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,Then what did the emoji movie really get?,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,"Just watch the trailer. Most movie studios these days just give a regurgitation of the plot and the films highlights in the trailers and if it does not interest you in 30 seconds, odds are it’s crap.",0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,If it's 90%+ it's a good movie don't be a little kid Vox and rely on pictures for movie reviews,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,"I love tomatoes, dislike rotten tomatoes and don’t mind Rotten Tomatoes.",0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,"Bruh, I knew it was bullshit when the Suicide Squad has 26% and Sausage Party had like 98% -____-",0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,Kingsman 1 got a 50% rating because thuh patriarchy.\nI don't put much stock into what critics think.,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,"lmao this video is just stupid and self-defeating. yes, if i see certified that's enough to tell me if i watch it or not. it's not like most ppl actually care about the number. the video makes this point but next time say that up front",0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,How much did Hollywood pay you to make this video?,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,Videos for this have been done and done and done months ago by many channels lol... late,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,"Yes, but how does knowing this help me understand that all white people are racist Vox???",0,0

oQyKpOJhUKY,I knew the emoji movie was actually g🅾️🅾️d,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,"Ehhh. Dunkirk and Moonlights are both great movies and that’s all I really want to know. I don’t really care about the semantics of which critics liked it more or weather the percentage is “fair”. I think the tomatometer works great.\\n\\nIf movies are lower than 40% skip it. If it’s 40%-70%, depending on the content of the movie I might like it ok but I usually always rent. Around 85% definitely see it in theaters. Over 92% probably a movie you will remember for the rest of your life and maybe even buy.\\n\\nUsually I walk out of the theater going “ya that was a 90% for sure” or “yeah that definitely was a 30% why did I waste my money on that crap”",0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,Rotten tomatoes is so stupid idk why it still exist,0,0

oQyKpOJhUKY,They should have discussed how Man Of Steel and The Incredible Hulk have virtually the same avg rating yet Man Of Steel is certified rotten and Incredible Hulk is certified fresh....,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,Rotten tomatoes is overrated! They gave power rangers a rating when is should’ve been a flat 0 on everything,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,and the whole point of this worthless video is...????,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,"Rotten Tomatoes is terrible and gets it wrong almost all the time. Just compare critic scores to user scores for films like The Red Pill, or star trek discovety. There is a huge disconnect between critics and regular people.",0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,"This is true, good job Vox. also to add on this, there are a lot of fake Flixster reviews. My best example is the Emoji Movie lol. It’s sad because there are a lot of really good movies that didn’t get as high of reviews. But it depends on how many put the effort into rating it on Flixster, and even the 5 stars available do not have a guideline to follow for each star, so a star review is poorly chosen by people. at a critic point, this video explains it great. At a fan base, it’s iffy and I’ve started to avoid concentrating on that. Now I look at Fandango and IMDB reviews.",0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,"Review systems for subjective content is not the problem... the problem is the reliance on scores for stuff waaaay beyond their scope. Like how bonuses deals are made with game developers depending on metacritic scores instead of something like... sales.\\nHistory has already proven that even general consensus on subjective pieces can completely change overtime. A whole bunch of literary classics went through a period where they weren't even acknowledged as noteworthy.\\nSo there. Sure, use aggregators and whatnot to have an idea of what people are saying about the stuff you are interested in watching, playing, reading and whatnot. Specially when in doubt. But the only perfect reviewer of the content you watch will always only be yourself.",0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,Almost every movie I grew up with has been rated 'rotten' by this site.. so I don't even follow these ratings anymore..,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,"This is why I prefer Metacritic.  It has three categories of positive, mixed, and negative, which I think is better than Rotten Tomatoes' binary positive and negative system.",0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,Well it saved me from watching Emoji movie. Good for me,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,they can go suck eggs for trashing the Underworld series. Glad I watched the series before seeing them. I still havent seen the last one because of their low scores... :(,0,0
oQyKpOJhUKY,"Who doesnt like free things? I have been playing this game verydice from the app store, and have ordered 5 things for Christmas so far. I've only been playing a month!

yWatz9TAgT0,You should try putting on mascara before eyeliner. Because after the mascara dries it acts as a guide when u put on the liquid eyeliner. Also when u do this its much easier to put it on with your eyes open and to start from the end and move in with small strokes. Also when you start at the end have the pointy part of the eyeliner be towards your hair rather than your nose and then switch it so that the pointy end faces your nose which will make the line more even.,0,0

yWatz9TAgT0,"Since you have oily skin I recommend using a powder of some sort, you put it on all over your face (or under your eyes & extra oily spots) with a big fluffy brush to set your makeup. It also keeps your makeup from creasing and will stop the shine. I recommend the Maybelline fit me matte \\nand poreless pressed powder or coty airspun translucent loose powder. Both are drug store and work really well! I will say though the coty airspun has a smell that kind of reminds me of a grandma, but I like it and it doesn’t bother me, also the loose powder will last a lot longer than the pressed one.",0,0

yWatz9TAgT0,"A few tips (not that you're doing anything wrong, just if you're interested):\\n\\n1. For your eyebrows, you're doing a fine job! You could try the same product in a lighter color because that is generally more forgiving. Also, I might go a tiny bit lighter on the inner part, closest to your nose (the hairs there are usually more sparse there, so it looks more natural)\\n2. For eye shadow, the general idea is to put a skin color all over the lid (up to your eyebrow). Then a little lower, above the crease, apply a slightly darker transition shade and blend. Then apply a darker shade in the crease and outer V. Do whatever color you want on the lid. That's it! But any colors/techniques work, whatever you like. I find the more important thing is finding good brushes (not expensive, just ones targeted to what you need). I use 2 small fluffy brushes (one to apply eye shadow and one to blend) and one really small brush for the more detailed crease/outer V work. I rarely wash my brushes either ;)\\n3. Eyeliner is always hard! I find that the type of tip and the formula really matter. You have to experiment and find the one that works for you. I like a really thin line, so I like a really long and thin tip. You can also do a pencil eyeliner instead, which might work better for you if it feels more natural in your hand.\\n4. All your face stuff is perfect!",0,0

Not sure of stockists for you as I’m in U.K. but definitely check it out because it has a slight green tinge to it, to combat the redness as well! \\n\\nAlso watch Lisa Eldridge tutorials - she has fantastic ones for redness solutions, easy tutorials, high-street (or drugstore in US) best brands.

And I don't wear mascara cause I wear glasses. 😂 also, I do eyeshadow & liner only when I feel like it. Maybe if you mixed ur foundation you could get a good shade? Remember to always dab with your sponge, instead of rubbing or hitting your face too fast, cause that won't blend the makeup well, and would give you wrinkles faster!! 😜 laughing real hard because you didn't blend your concealer on your Cupid's bow. Try to tap away excess powder instead of blowing because that gives it more germs which isn't good for your skin. And be more gentle when putting on your eyeshadow!! If you think your eyeliner is wobbly, put your pinky against your face to give more stability, and rest your elbow on a table.",0,0
yWatz9TAgT0,"Michelle!! It’s really important for you to clean your brushes and sponges, wet beauty sponges absorb more bacteria and it means more acne :( I used to hate doing it and would put it off all the time but dawn dish soap and virgin olive oil mixed together makes an amazing and easy cleanser!

I have a really red face, and what I do is color correct in those areas first, then I put concealer over the entire red area, then I do my foundation and that usually does the trick.

yWatz9TAgT0,"Tips that have helped me: \\nWhen you’re doing your eyeshadow, use a blending brush and go in tiny circular motions and use a tiny bit of color at a time and just build up to how dark you’d like it to be. Using a darker color for your crease and putting it a little higher than normal will make your eyes look bigger, I’ve seen a few people on here say that! \\nAlso, when you’re contouring on your cheeks, bring the brush UP with each stroke, and when you’re contouring on your head, bring the brush DOWN with each stroke. I’m not sure how much of a difference these little things make, but experimenting is always helpful 😊 your make up always looks really good and you look great without it too.",2,0

yWatz9TAgT0,"I also have natural red and pink tones to my skin, although they’re not as prominent as yours. You’re on the right track with the color corrector before your foundation, but I would seriously think about investing in fuller coverage foundation. If you’re not comfortable going somewhere like Sephora, Ulta or to a Clinique counter take a look at Boots Number 7 at Target. It’s around $20 a bottle & I personally use two different shades & combine them. So that makes it around $40. I know it seems expensive, but with as much money as you spend on your classroom I think it’s okay if you spend a little on yourself too.",0,0

You are very brave going from absolutely no hair done and no makeup to a full process.  This comes from someone who's been using makeup and hair products for over 30 years!  And I still don't know how it's going to turn out from day to day!  By the way, my eyes water in the morning too, so eyeliner is hard, hit and miss I guess.  Don't worry about your eyebrows, you can't tell that they don't perfectly match (I wouldn't have known until you told me, lol).  Just be confident in what you're doing, it's OK.

You can suddenly become allergic to peanuts, penicillin, latex, or just about anything else, because the toxins associated with them (proteins that mimic dangerous pathogens and trigger an overreactive autoimmune response) aren't quickly flushed by the body. You get rid of toxins by no longer putting them in your body. And yes, you do sweat them out.

Methotrexate for example is a folic acid analogue, folic acid being important in DNA synthesis. Methotrexate is bound by enzymes by the same mechanism as folic acid and causes inhibition, under normal circumstances that's bad, but take that into account with the fact that cancer cells undergo mitosis at a far increased rate and because of this have to synthesise huge amounts of DNA and you have a cancer drug.",0,0

1KCZHHMZVGQ,"Might've helped if you tried to define toxins in some way. Usually a toxin is an impurity or chemical that shouldn't be inside your body. As for how they are removed it's with your body's natural processes which can only be modified with drugs and vitamins although generally your body does everything at about the same average rate. Anytime your body speeds up it has to slow down later to balance it.

yWatz9TAgT0,You should try putting on mascara before eyeliner. Because after the mascara dries it acts as a guide when u put on the liquid eyeliner. Also when u do this its much easier to put it on with your eyes open and to start from the end and move in with small strokes. Also when you start at the end have the pointy part of the eyeliner be towards your hair rather than your nose and then switch it so that the pointy end faces your nose which will make the line more even.,0,0

yWatz9TAgT0,"Since you have oily skin I recommend using a powder of some sort, you put it on all over your face (or under your eyes & extra oily spots) with a big fluffy brush to set your makeup. It also keeps your makeup from creasing and will stop the shine. I recommend the Maybelline fit me matte \\nand poreless pressed powder or coty airspun translucent loose powder. Both are drug store and work really well! I will say though the coty airspun has a smell that kind of reminds me of a grandma, but I like it and it doesn’t bother me, also the loose powder will last a lot longer than the pressed one.",0,0

yWatz9TAgT0,"A few tips (not that you're doing anything wrong, just if you're interested):\\n\\n1. For your eyebrows, you're doing a fine job! You could try the same product in a lighter color because that is generally more forgiving. Also, I might go a tiny bit lighter on the inner part, closest to your nose (the hairs there are usually more sparse there, so it looks more natural)\\n2. For eye shadow, the general idea is to put a skin color all over the lid (up to your eyebrow). Then a little lower, above the crease, apply a slightly darker transition shade and blend. Then apply a darker shade in the crease and outer V. Do whatever color you want on the lid. That's it! But any colors/techniques work, whatever you like. I find the more important thing is finding good brushes (not expensive, just ones targeted to what you need). I use 2 small fluffy brushes (one to apply eye shadow and one to blend) and one really small brush for the more detailed crease/outer V work. I rarely wash my brushes either ;)\\n3. Eyeliner is always hard! I find that the type of tip and the formula really matter. You have to experiment and find the one that works for you. I like a really thin line, so I like a really long and thin tip. You can also do a pencil eyeliner instead, which might work better for you if it feels more natural in your hand.\\n4. All your face stuff is perfect!",0,0

And I don't wear mascara cause I wear glasses. 😂 also, I do eyeshadow & liner only when I feel like it. Maybe if you mixed ur foundation you could get a good shade? Remember to always dab with your sponge, instead of rubbing or hitting your face too fast, cause that won't blend the makeup well, and would give you wrinkles faster!! 😜 laughing real hard because you didn't blend your concealer on your Cupid's bow. Try to tap away excess powder instead of blowing because that gives it more germs which isn't good for your skin. And be more gentle when putting on your eyeshadow!! If you think your eyeliner is wobbly, put your pinky against your face to give more stability, and rest your elbow on a table.",0,0
yWatz9TAgT0,"Michelle!! It’s really important for you to clean your brushes and sponges, wet beauty sponges absorb more bacteria and it means more acne :( I used to hate doing it and would put it off all the time but dawn dish soap and virgin olive oil mixed together makes an amazing and easy cleanser!

yWatz9TAgT0,"I also have natural red and pink tones to my skin, although they’re not as prominent as yours. You’re on the right track with the color corrector before your foundation, but I would seriously think about investing in fuller coverage foundation. If you’re not comfortable going somewhere like Sephora, Ulta or to a Clinique counter take a look at Boots Number 7 at Target. It’s around $20 a bottle & I personally use two different shades & combine them. So that makes it around $40. I know it seems expensive, but with as much money as you spend on your classroom I think it’s okay if you spend a little on yourself too.",0,0

yWatz9TAgT0,"Tips that have helped me: \\nWhen you’re doing your eyeshadow, use a blending brush and go in tiny circular motions and use a tiny bit of color at a time and just build up to how dark you’d like it to be. Using a darker color for your crease and putting it a little higher than normal will make your eyes look bigger, I’ve seen a few people on here say that! \\nAlso, when you’re contouring on your cheeks, bring the brush UP with each stroke, and when you’re contouring on your head, bring the brush DOWN with each stroke. I’m not sure how much of a difference these little things make, but experimenting is always helpful 😊 your make up always looks really good and you look great without it too.",2,0

When you do wear makeup, you do a fantastic job.  For someone who hasn't been using makeup for very long, you apply everything really well.  You are very brave going from absolutely no hair done and no makeup to a full process.  This comes from someone who's been using makeup and hair products for over 30 years!  And I still don't know how it's going to turn out from day to day!  By the way, my eyes water in the morning too, so eyeliner is hard, hit and miss I guess.  Don't worry about your eyebrows, you can't tell that they don't perfectly match (I wouldn't have known until you told me, lol).  Just be confident in what you're doing, it's OK.

1KCZHHMZVGQ,"Uh, toxins are any element or chemical compound that cause damage to part of your body. In order to do any significant damage, they have to be present in certain amounts, but they do exist, and they can build up. That's how anaphylactic allergies can suddenly appear or worsen at any age. You can suddenly become allergic to peanuts, penicillin, latex, or just about anything else, because the toxins associated with them (proteins that mimic dangerous pathogens and trigger an overreactive autoimmune response) aren't quickly flushed by the body. You get rid of toxins by no longer putting them in your body. And yes, you do sweat them out. Flushing toxins via sweat is basically ineffective compared to flushing them down the toilet, but your pores do release some very basic toxins.",0,0

Because otherwise, the folks in the room are just as bad as those outside. \\n\\nThe identity politics is incredibly strong in this video. Why can’t he wear his MAGA hat as well as have fun with those in “The Penthouse”? \\n\\nThis video has a leftist message and its apparent how they tried to disguise it. So I will now dismantle it. They made it look as if by removing the hat meant that the white man wanted to put politics aside and join the ever so “Tolerant” group in the room. But we all know that by removing that hat, he disassociated himself with his political party, and that’s the only reason he let him in. If they were actually willing to put politics aside, he shouldn’t have had to take the hat off.\\n\\nThis video was so close to being perfect. If he allowed him to come in, with the hat, and showed unity between not only people of color, but people of political preference, it would have been perfect. A missed opportunity I think.",0,0

1KCZHHMZVGQ,"I hope that this episode actually provides some useful information instead of a generalized the wellness industry is lying to you nonsense. So far in to this 'tease', it is just misleading. Certain toxins are expressed through the skin and sweat, such as heavy metals like lead, cadmium and arsenic (Sears et al., 2013). The skin is widely known to aid xenobiotic drug detoxification as an excretion organ (Zhou, et al. 2012) You can even use sweat-patch testing to test for illicit drug traces in the sweat of addicts (Kintz, 1996) and animal studies even suggest that skin detoxification may play a role in preventing metabolic diseases and insulin resistance (Liu, et al. 2012).\\n\\n The comment on CUPPING is misleading as well, as it is has shown evidence for helping lower back pain in a recent meta-analysis of studies (Wang, et al., 2017), osteoarthritis (Li, et al., 2017), constipation in children (Shahamat, et al., 2016), lateral femoral cutaneous neuritis and cervical spondylosis (Zhang, et al. 2017). I don't know if it is MARKETED for detoxification, but so far the research is more interested in the effects on the musculoskeletal system. \\n\\nSome natural therapies such as herbal (Chung, 2015), probiotics (Markowiak and Śliżewska*, 2017), foods like garlic (Wu, et al. 2002) and green leafy vegetables (Rose, et al. 2005) and one literature review found several supplements have some scientific basis for aiding detoxification of heavy metals, including magnesium, zinc, chlorella, taurine, apha lipoic acid, n-acetyl-cysteine, and glutathione (Sears, 2013). \\n\\nWith the first ever clinical human study (funded by the NCCIH) into the effect of saunas on detoxification currently underway, maybe best to wait for those results (and future studies) before saying there is no effect. \\n\\nWhen talking about toxins are we talking about endotoxins & lipopolysaccharides from intestinal microbes and dysbiosis of flora -- found in several recent studies to be influenced by environmental chemicals, (Rosenfeld, 2017, and Chi, et al., 2017) -- or environmentally persistent chemicals like DDT on cellular health (Torres-Sanches, et al., 2007), and other pesticides and herbicides like round-up (a known carcinogen found in excessive amounts in the drinking water and ground water of numerous countries including the USA, Canada and Mexica)? \\n\\nOr the effect of PCB chemicals on human reproductive health (Toft, et al., 2014)? What about flame retardants (found in 72%-75% of urine samples of pregnant women) and their effect on the neurodevelopment of human fetuses (Castorina, et al., 2017)? \\n\\n Air pollution? What about microplastics and nanoplastics found in tap water, honey, sugar, beer, seafood, etc. on several continents? (The Guardian, September 2017)  What about endogenous toxins that we ourselves produce? Or the oxidative burden of liver phase 1 detoxification of all these compounds all the effing time?\\n\\n The biggest problem is that many of these compounds are not water soluble, or are not readily chelated and excreted by the human body. \\n\\nThe wellness industry aiding people with detoxification is laudable -- obviously we NEED it. The problem is how to do it in an effective and evidence-based way. I love Adam Ruins Everything (seriously) but PLEASE be careful how you treat this subject... you have a large audience, and thousands (if not millions) of people are influenced by your information. Don't tell them that toxins have no effect, or that it is all bogus..PLEASE don't make the misinformation worse. PLEASE.",0,0

1KCZHHMZVGQ,"Uh, toxins are any element or chemical compound that cause damage to part of your body. In order to do any significant damage, they have to be present in certain amounts, but they do exist, and they can build up. That's how anaphylactic allergies can suddenly appear or worsen at any age. You can suddenly become allergic to peanuts, penicillin, latex, or just about anything else, because the toxins associated with them (proteins that mimic dangerous pathogens and trigger an overreactive autoimmune response) aren't quickly flushed by the body. You get rid of toxins by no longer putting them in your body. And yes, you do sweat them out.

1KCZHHMZVGQ,"Toxins are chemicals that cause a conformation change in proteins/enzymes that is irreversible. It basically stops the protein’s function for good. But, thanks to the central dogma of biology, our cells will probably make much more of the protein anyway. And yes, these “dead” proteins will be exported out of your body via your ass.",0,0

1KCZHHMZVGQ,"I hope that this episode actually provides some useful information instead of a generalized the wellness industry is lying to you nonsense. So far in to this 'tease', it is just misleading. Certain toxins are expressed through the skin and sweat, such as heavy metals like lead, cadmium and arsenic (Sears et al., 2013). The skin is widely known to aid xenobiotic drug detoxification as an excretion organ (Zhou, et al. 2012) You can even use sweat-patch testing to test for illicit drug traces in the sweat of addicts (Kintz, 1996) and animal studies even suggest that skin detoxification may play a role in preventing metabolic diseases and insulin resistance (Liu, et al. 2012).\\n\\n The comment on CUPPING is misleading as well, as it is has shown evidence for helping lower back pain in a recent meta-analysis of studies (Wang, et al., 2017), osteoarthritis (Li, et al., 2017), constipation in children (Shahamat, et al., 2016), lateral femoral cutaneous neuritis and cervical spondylosis (Zhang, et al. 2017). I don't know if it is MARKETED for detoxification, but so far the research is more interested in the effects on the musculoskeletal system. \\n\\nSome natural therapies such as herbal (Chung, 2015), probiotics (Markowiak and Śliżewska*, 2017), foods like garlic (Wu, et al. 2002) and green leafy vegetables (Rose, et al. 2005) and one literature review found several supplements have some scientific basis for aiding detoxification of heavy metals, including magnesium, zinc, chlorella, taurine, apha lipoic acid, n-acetyl-cysteine, and glutathione (Sears, 2013). \\n\\nWith the first ever clinical human study (funded by the NCCIH) into the effect of saunas on detoxification currently underway, maybe best to wait for those results (and future studies) before saying there is no effect. \\n\\nWhen talking about toxins are we talking about endotoxins & lipopolysaccharides from intestinal microbes and dysbiosis of flora -- found in several recent studies to be influenced by environmental chemicals, (Rosenfeld, 2017, and Chi, et al., 2017) -- or environmentally persistent chemicals like DDT on cellular health (Torres-Sanches, et al., 2007), and other pesticides and herbicides like round-up (a known carcinogen found in excessive amounts in the drinking water and ground water of numerous countries including the USA, Canada and Mexica)? \\n\\nOr the effect of PCB chemicals on human reproductive health (Toft, et al., 2014)? What about flame retardants (found in 72%-75% of urine samples of pregnant women) and their effect on the neurodevelopment of human fetuses (Castorina, et al., 2017)? \\n\\n Air pollution? What about microplastics and nanoplastics found in tap water, honey, sugar, beer, seafood, etc. on several continents? (The Guardian, September 2017)  What about endogenous toxins that we ourselves produce? Or the oxidative burden of liver phase 1 detoxification of all these compounds all the effing time?\\n\\n The biggest problem is that many of these compounds are not water soluble, or are not readily chelated and excreted by the human body. \\n\\nThe wellness industry aiding people with detoxification is laudable -- obviously we NEED it. The problem is how to do it in an effective and evidence-based way. I love Adam Ruins Everything (seriously) but PLEASE be careful how you treat this subject... you have a large audience, and thousands (if not millions) of people are influenced by your information. Don't tell them that toxins have no effect, or that it is all bogus..PLEASE don't make the misinformation worse. PLEASE.",0,2

The skin is widely known to aid xenobiotic drug detoxification as an excretion organ (Zhou, et al. 2012) You can even use sweat-patch testing to test for illicit drug traces in the sweat of addicts (Kintz, 1996) and animal studies even suggest that skin detoxification may play a role in preventing metabolic diseases and insulin resistance (Liu, et al. 2012).\\n\\n The comment on CUPPING is misleading as well, as it is has shown evidence for helping lower back pain in a recent meta-analysis of studies (Wang, et al., 2017), osteoarthritis (Li, et al., 2017), constipation in children (Shahamat, et al., 2016), lateral femoral cutaneous neuritis and cervical spondylosis (Zhang, et al. 2017). I don't know if it is MARKETED for detoxification, but so far the research is more interested in the effects on the musculoskeletal system. \\n\\nSome natural therapies such as herbal (Chung, 2015), probiotics (Markowiak and Śliżewska*, 2017), foods like garlic (Wu, et al. 2002) and green leafy vegetables (Rose, et al. 2005) and one literature review found several supplements have some scientific basis for aiding detoxification of heavy metals, including magnesium, zinc, chlorella, taurine, apha lipoic acid, n-acetyl-cysteine, and glutathione (Sears, 2013). \\n\\nWith the first ever clinical human study (funded by the NCCIH) into the effect of saunas on detoxification currently underway, maybe best to wait for those results (and future studies) before saying there is no effect. \\n\\nWhen talking about toxins are we talking about endotoxins & lipopolysaccharides from intestinal microbes and dysbiosis of flora -- found in several recent studies to be influenced by environmental chemicals, (Rosenfeld, 2017, and Chi, et al., 2017) -- or environmentally persistent chemicals like DDT on cellular health (Torres-Sanches, et al., 2007), and other pesticides and herbicides like round-up (a known carcinogen found in excessive amounts in the drinking water and ground water of numerous countries including the USA, Canada and Mexica)? \\n\\nOr the effect of PCB chemicals on human reproductive health (Toft, et al., 2014)? What about flame retardants (found in 72%-75% of urine samples of pregnant women) and their effect on the neurodevelopment of human fetuses (Castorina, et al., 2017)? \\n\\n Air pollution? What about microplastics and nanoplastics found in tap water, honey, sugar, beer, seafood, etc. on several continents? (The Guardian, September 2017)  What about endogenous toxins that we ourselves produce? Or the oxidative burden of liver phase 1 detoxification of all these compounds all the effing time?\\n\\n The biggest problem is that many of these compounds are not water soluble, or are not readily chelated and excreted by the human body. \\n\\nThe wellness industry aiding people with detoxification is laudable -- obviously we NEED it. The problem is how to do it in an effective and evidence-based way. I love Adam Ruins Everything (seriously) but PLEASE be careful how you treat this subject... you have a large audience, and thousands (if not millions) of people are influenced by your information. Don't tell them that toxins have no effect, or that it is all bogus..PLEASE don't make the misinformation worse. PLEASE.",0,2

mPjgRKW_Jmk,"John, Wikipedia Mrs Thatcher, there is not a bad idea that did not come from her time, which is to say from those whose ideas she followed.  Mind you it is ages since I looked her up, I no longer no what is said there about her in wikipedia. Her Austrian School economic team suggested that you had to look after the person with industries because they give jobs and that is the king pin on which they hang all reforms. \\n That premise established, how do you look after these needy people?  Well, reduce the credit of trade unions. Also reduce taxes on industry and their owners, so now we have billionaires, before such people were too heavily taxed to get that rich. Also, reduce laws that control industries such as, the trade descriptions acts I should think. That is probably why such as Equifax can be so terribly vague about what they do they are no longer obliged to explainthing satisfactorily.\\n    It makes me so sick that the supposedly economical  ideas of economist of Thatchers time have been taken up so totally, swallowed hook, line and sinker, by nearly all now and are the cause of so much trouble and are still not attacked from their source. \\n   They were said to be economic ideas, I think they were just propagandistic ideas that they believed would work and have indeed done so to allow us to molly coddle the very rich in hope that that was the best way to help the poor. The opposing argument is that if you help  the poor then industry will have more buyers which is what industry really needs. So, the well fare state is the real way to expand the economy. It certainly took all countries who implemented it into the twentieth century. \\n   The idea that the industries employ people and so, to so look after industries and industrialists is the right way to go, was really how economic thinking worked from the dawn of time until social reforms started and economic theory became much more complicated and successful. It is the prevalent thought about how a country works economically in those times when economy so horribly failed to be useful to more than a very small percentage of any society, so to reinstate it as a guiding principal is only to return to the bad old days before trade unions started to ask for more money for workers.  Where would this money come from? Doing so strangely worked, more money was found  our economies expanded and the well fare state  pulled us into our modern times when countries had so much more than they had ever had before. Countries were estaablished in which so many people stopped being  so appallingly poor. \\n The religious like the rights ideas. The well fare state stole their industries, the poor. medicine and schooling. \\n   Their arguments are that there is a certain amount of money to go round so we should share it  in ored to make the poor  richer  so  give your money to us. and they are a collective which is a very big and powerful pressure group. \\n   They pretend that for countries to exist in which the poor are rich,  it means that richer countries are stealing stuff off poorer ones. We used to steal off poor countries without our poor being any the richer, so I am not sure that the poor in our countries getting better off has much to do with stealing off poor countries, we just do that for pure, useless uninventiveness and choosing the easy way in many cases.\\n    they also pretend that there is a set amount of money which has to be shared round. There is not a set amount of money or goods, economies can expand or decrease and an awful lot of things we need can be found from within our countries so we can expand without taking from others, rock to build with, land to cultivate, teachers to teach more children, we can increase the amount of teachers that exist in any country without stealing from any one, etc. In England it might seem as if we cultivate all the land but in the Mediterranean there is an awful lot of land which is not cultivated, which is moor land and so here it is easy to see that we could cultivate so much more food than we do in this world, We can expand with greater efficiency instead of sharing out and with clean energy we can all have heated swimming pools without hurting anyone.",0,0

Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \\nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\\n\\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\\n\\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\\n\\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\\n\\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\\n\\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\\n\\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\\n\\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\\n\\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\\n\\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\\n\\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\\n\\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\\n\\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \\n\\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\\n\\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",0,0

X2tejP45Lwc,"1. Stop being interested in things to seem cool. You're not cool, you're a dork and one day you will carry that name with pride. Like what you really like and don't be ashamed.\\n2. That acne will go away. Yes, it might be almost halfway into your twenties, but it will happen when you move out of your parent's house and you will see that your skin was actually terrible because of mold in the walls and not because you're a repulsive monster, like you think.\\n(3. About that mold... There's a fucking huge leak in the house's kitchen wall. Maybe check that out, because when you realise it, it will be too late and the whole family will be pretty much homeless for 8 months...........)\\n3. 23 year old Eve... I know your are severely depressed. And you're lonely. And I know you're scared. Of everything. And that you see no way of that ever changing, because it has been that way for the last ten years. But you are not going to be alone forever. Boys will like you. Or at least the right one. He will show up just before you turn 24 and it will change your life completely. And within a year, the best year of your life, your biggest dream will come true and you will have your newborn little son in your arms.\\n\\nSo, since I ca 2015 can't read this, I hope someone who's in the same position I was will stumble upon this and see that if you just take one little step that may seem like the biggest one (like me actually daring to start dating and signing up for a dating site) your biggest dream, that somehow feel least likely to happen, can actually come true. \\nAnd also, do what my family didn't and check your taps so that water isn't flooding the inside of your walls every time you turn them on.",0,0

Don't worry, it's fake, so the collar isn't going to hurt him. Plus it came with a little red mohawk. Now I wasn't planning on using the mohawk, but when I put it on him, it just looked so cute and funny. xD I might just use it. And finally my Big, Fluffy, Chubby Cat. He's going to be Wendy from the Wizard of Oz. Now Listen, I know he's a boy, but the other outfits didn't fit him and he was just so adorable. x3 Plus the dress makes the outfit more comfortable for him then the others.

It can be used to pay everywhere like a credit card in America, but our bank account gets charged directly without taking the detour over the credit institution.

That acne will go away. Yes, it might be almost halfway into your twenties, but it will happen when you move out of your parent's house and you will see that your skin was actually terrible because of mold in the walls and not because you're a repulsive monster, like you think.\\n(3. About that mold... There's a fucking huge leak in the house's kitchen wall. Maybe check that out, because when you realise it, it will be too late and the whole family will be pretty much homeless for 8 months...........)\\n3. 23 year old Eve... I know your are severely depressed. And you're lonely. And I know you're scared. Of everything. And that you see no way of that ever changing, because it has been that way for the last ten years. But you are not going to be alone forever. Boys will like you. Or at least the right one. He will show up just before you turn 24 and it will change your life completely. And within a year, the best year of your life, your biggest dream will come true and you will have your newborn little son in your arms.\\n\\nSo, since I ca 2015 can't read this, I hope someone who's in the same position I was will stumble upon this and see that if you just take one little step that may seem like the biggest one (like me actually daring to start dating and signing up for a dating site) your biggest dream, that somehow feel least likely to happen, can actually come true. \\nAnd also, do what my family didn't and check your taps so that water isn't flooding the inside of your walls every time you turn them on.",0,0

a5NIg5yyHWo,I would've taken the money myself. But if you're not desperate ... don't be. It's really that simple. Go list it at an auction yourself and you could see $300k plus but me personally I think $200k for a $250k evaluation is one of the most fair offers Rick's ever made and it got turned down anyways LOL,0,0
a5NIg5yyHWo,"As amazing as the sound of making $200k would be for those saying they would take the deal is.  That deal would not sound so great if you laid that or near that much on the costume to begin with.  Also keep in mind a pawn shop or any establishment had to factor in resale to the price so you will always be able to make more selling at auction or on your own to a private seller.  Like some others surmise, I am thinking this person only brought the costume on the show for publicity more than anything else, knowing it may drum up further interest in the costume and potential sale price when sold privately or at auction.  Further evidence leading to that conclusion is that the seller didn't put up any sort of fight,  or offer a reasonable counter offer other than reiterating his initial asking price of $250k.  The seller knew exactly what he was doing, he just wanted himself and the costume on TV.  And myself as an enthusiast of the original movies am thankful to get to see the original costume again regardless of that possible fact.",2,0

mPjgRKW_Jmk,"Three quick things:\\n\\n1.) Don't put electronic devices in rice to dry them. It just gets rice dust in your device. Just let them air dry before using again.\\n\\n2.) Consider placing a fraud alert on your credit instead of a freeze. You only have to notify one company and they will contact the other two. It's free! It lasts 90 days, but you can easily renew it when it expires. While the alert is in effect you will be contacted anytime someone tries to access your credit to verify your identity. I wouldn't trust Equifax to do this so I'd recommend using either TransUnion or Experian. Doing a search for either company plus fraud alert can find you the info you need to add a fraud alert to your credit online.\\n\\n3.) If the hack was state sponsored (rumors are China was behind it) that means they were probably looking to get information on people in the government.

It can be used to pay everywhere like a credit card in America, but our bank account gets charged directly without taking the detour over the credit institution.

X2tejP45Lwc,"1. Stop being interested in things to seem cool. You're not cool, you're a dork and one day you will carry that name with pride. Like what you really like and don't be ashamed.\\n2. That acne will go away. Yes, it might be almost halfway into your twenties, but it will happen when you move out of your parent's house and you will see that your skin was actually terrible because of mold in the walls and not because you're a repulsive monster, like you think.\\n(3. About that mold... There's a fucking huge leak in the house's kitchen wall. Maybe check that out, because when you realise it, it will be too late and the whole family will be pretty much homeless for 8 months...........)\\n3. 23 year old Eve... I know your are severely depressed. And you're lonely. And I know you're scared. Of everything. And that you see no way of that ever changing, because it has been that way for the last ten years. But you are not going to be alone forever. Boys will like you. Or at least the right one. He will show up just before you turn 24 and it will change your life completely. And within a year, the best year of your life, your biggest dream will come true and you will have your newborn little son in your arms.\\n\\nSo, since I ca 2015 can't read this, I hope someone who's in the same position I was will stumble upon this and see that if you just take one little step that may seem like the biggest one (like me actually daring to start dating and signing up for a dating site) your biggest dream, that somehow feel least likely to happen, can actually come true. \\nAnd also, do what my family didn't and check your taps so that water isn't flooding the inside of your walls every time you turn them on.",0,0
