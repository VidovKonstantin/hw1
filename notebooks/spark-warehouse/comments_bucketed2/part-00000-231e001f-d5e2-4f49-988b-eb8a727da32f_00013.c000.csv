It will have the most used features, largest and most well-developed App Store, and highest adoption rate of hardware & software out of every single phone on the planet. People will be willing to pay for these devices for years to come, and it all comes from the (non-arguably) brilliant marketing tactics that Apple has been following for years.

GOOP basically takes advantage of misinformed people, that spend money they don't have to buy things they don't need, don't work, may be harmful, and are overpriced, because they somehow trust Paltrow for advice. Some examples of snake oil scams promoted recently by the magazine: 1. Wellness stickers from NASA that were publicly discredited by NASA, which confirmed the product has no technology developed by NASA in it. 2. Yoni Jade Eggs, which women are supposed to put inside their vaginas, which in the words of OB-GYN Dr. Gunter could be a risk factor for bacterial vaginosis or even the potentially deadly toxic shock syndrome; and 3. Vaginal Steaming which doctors also call a load of garbage. Just to name a few. They have been repeatedly knocked for false advertising, misleading advertising, and settled lawsuits out of court. It is truly horrifying to see CBS promoting this garbage. I hope CBS is named in future lawsuits that are sure to come as people are injured and/or simply realize they were duped by Paltrow and GOOP.",0,0

Thats like a Mc Donalds employee killing someone and the CEO of Mc Donalds being called a culprit, but you no doubt are aware of that testimony not having evidence to support it. They didn't have footage, much of her story didn't match up to what they saw when investigating, and that is why nobody was convicted. That 171 number that you cited, were not american citizens.

What damages the racist ideology more is Asians do very well in America, so do the Latinos, Arabians, and Indians Three of the races fought brutal wars not to long ago with white american ancestors. The Asians fought in WW2, Korea war, and the Vietnam war which many white Americans died. But people in from those asain  countries do very well even better than whites in America. Latinos have had wars with Americans, so have the Arabians. How are these three races dealing with the evil white racism people in America?  How many war with Africa had the United States fought? Try to use your racism card out of that black people!\\nOnly way to prove racism is to move half of million blacks from United States to Japan, India, Iran, Russia, China, Australia, Israel, and a country in Europe. Moving half a million black people from the united States back to a country in Africa would prove the racist ideology wrong.\\nIf the half million black people in this nations become successful without welfare and stay out of prison than people can say the United States is a racist nation of people.

_HTXMhKWqnA,"Definitely not a worthy phone. \\nCons : 1)Awkward display design at upper end.. it irritates a lot after looking long at it\\n             2)OLED is still inferior in this device when compared to samsung..u can check on the web or a youtube video\\n             3) Wireless charging is a basic feature since lumia phones so apple need not hike its price\\n             4}Steel frame is a scratch magnet..U can check iphone 3 used phones on the web\\n             5)Glass body is gone with iphone 5..so the phone is again vulnerable to damage..U need to save lot of repair money for \\n               the future\\n            6)No significant new feature compared to present market..battery and performance improvements they mentioned are \\n                negligible for an upgrade.\\n            7)Facial recognition to unlock is a two step process and it irritates to unlock after few days. Also facial recognition to unlock phone will have high failure rate and time taking though it may be few seconds but time taking with high failure rate.\\n            8)Cost of s8 with all the oled, wireless charging, ram, performance is too less when compared to iphone 10\\n            9)Lack of home button is not an invention its a big drawback. Home button makes a phone iphone. so atleast they \\n                should come up with a virtual home button without facial recognition.\\n         10)Unlocking sleeping persons phone without touching them is now made so easy with facial",0,0

She does not even know Phils is. She is genetically part Filipina, but her father cleared already that the mother has Zero talent in Singing.

What damages the racist ideology more is Asians do very well in America, so do the Latinos, Arabians, and Indians Three of the races fought brutal wars not to long ago with white american ancestors. The Asians fought in WW2, Korea war, and the Vietnam war which many white Americans died. But people in from those asain  countries do very well even better than whites in America. Latinos have had wars with Americans, so have the Arabians. How are these three races dealing with the evil white racism people in America?  How many war with Africa had the United States fought? Try to use your racism card out of that black people!\\nOnly way to prove racism is to move half of million blacks from United States to Japan, India, Iran, Russia, China, Australia, Israel, and a country in Europe. Moving half a million black people from the united States back to a country in Africa would prove the racist ideology wrong.\\nIf the half million black people in this nations become successful without welfare and stay out of prison than people can say the United States is a racist nation of people.

Also facial recognition to unlock phone will have high failure rate and time taking though it may be few seconds but time taking with high failure rate.\\n            8)Cost of s8 with all the oled, wireless charging, ram, performance is too less when compared to iphone 10\\n            9)Lack of home button is not an invention its a big drawback. Home button makes a phone iphone. so atleast they \\n                should come up with a virtual home button without facial recognition.\\n         10)Unlocking sleeping persons phone without touching them is now made so easy with facial",0,0

gIE105f0ejg,"More than 100 stealth egg attacks baffle one Euclid homeowner and police (photos and video) EUCLID, Ohio -- An 85-year-old Euclid man's home has become the target of mysterious egging attacks that began in March 2014 and haven't stopped. The continuous onslaught of eggs has baffled police, neighbors and local government officials who have tried and failed to identify the source of the attacks that have ruined the man's home and kept his family on edge. The accuracy is phenomenal, Albert Clemens, Sr. said. Because almost every time when it's nice weather and they launch five or six of these at a time, they almost invariably hit the front door. Clemens green two-story house sits on the corner of Wilmore Avenue and East 210th Street. He and his wife bought the home as newlyweds about 60 years ago. Though his wife has since passed away, Clemens still lives there with his 49-year-old daughter and 51-year-old son. The house has been pelted with eggs several times a week -- sometimes more than once a day -- for the past year. The attacks always happen after dark and last around 10 minutes each. The family has been awoken as late as 2 a.m. by what sounds like the crack of a gunshot against the aluminum siding or front door. Clemens and police believe the eggs are being launched from a block or two away. The siding on the front of Clemens' home is destroyed, splattered with dried egg residue that stripped off the paint. Other than a few rogue eggs that hit nearby homes, no other neighbors have been targeted. Somebody is deeply, deeply angry at somebody in that household for some reason, Euclid Lt. Mitch Houser said. Winter offered a short respite for the family, as the egging became less frequent during the cold weather. But both Clemens and police anticipate the attacks picking back up as the snow and ice thaw. An unsolved mystery Euclid police have not taken the investigation lightly. They've spent a year doing undercover stakeouts, canvassing the neighborhood and even sending eggshells for testing. The department's entire community policing unit was dedicated to tracking down the eggers at one point. Officers respond quickly to every egging call at the home -- which is less than a mile from the police station. Both Clemens and detectives are at a dead end when it comes to suspects. Clemens had suspicions about a young man across the street who confronted him a couple years ago and asked him to stop calling police about suspicious activity in the neighborhood. Clemens said that he had started calling police more often as he noticed more crime -- mostly suspected drug activity. Another neighbor Clemens suspected was ruled out when officers saw him standing outside as an attack occurred in the presence of police. Investigators have taken several different approaches to nabbing the eggers, including installing a surveillance camera on the house. Detectives even collected some eggshell samples and tested them in a crime lab. The eggs were traced back to a local Amish farm, but the trail ended there. Clemens says the culprits either have access to a large supply of eggs or are stealing them from businesses that throw them out when they go bad. Detectives have followed this thread, visiting local restaurants and businesses asking about missing eggs. They've also tried collecting fingerprints from eggshells, but Houser said that's an impossible task. When an egg breaks, it releases proteins that destroy DNA. Officers have gone door to door questioning neighbors and handing out fliers. Nobody has come forward with any tips. The person or people who are doing it have remained very tight-lipped apparently, Houser said. I would imagine it would be hard to keep a secret of something that had been done hundreds of times and for nobody to step forward to talk about it. The guilty parties don't appear to be intimidated by police interest in the case. An officer last year was taking a report when a barrage of eggs was launched at the house. One hit him in the foot. Houser said he's never seen this level of vandalism in his 20 years of police work. It's frustrated the whole department, which has dedicated hundreds of hours toward solving the egging mystery. The man hours put into that investigation were huge and one of the reasons it's so frustrating that we don't have somebody right now that we can criminally charge, Houser said. The culprits will face charges of felony vandalism and criminal damaging, Houser said. Additional charges could be tacked on if investigators find evidence that the attacks are a hate crime. The search continues Clemens is waiting until the perpetrators are caught before he repairs the tarnished siding. His insurance company is refusing to settle a claim until the guilty party is found. He said he used to clean up after each attack, but it became so frequent that he couldn't keep up. Police initially offered a $500 reward for information, but bumped it up to $1,000 after nobody came forward. That money is still up for grabs. We're not going to let it go, Houser said. We'll continue to put effort into it until we figure something out. Despite all the torment, Clemens said he'd never consider moving from his beloved home. I like the neighborhood, Clemens said. I like the city of Euclid. I would live and die in this house -- but it's been kind of a nightmare.",0,0

Indeed NASA was a shadow of its former self after Apollo ended and the Shuttle was built with a complexity rivaling a SaturnV but not the labor force it required to fly it at the rate/cost the agency projected in the early 1970s. A throw away booster would of been safer but a reusable one's labor requirements were tailored for another era not the post Viet Nam belt tightening and once flush with Cold War rivalry had evaporated along with its budget.",0,1

Qué bueno que Pixar abarque otras culturas y, por lo que sé, hay una profunda investigación de sus realizadores respecto a la tradición, incluso estuvieron en época de día de muertos en varios lugares de México para contrastar las diversas maneras que celebramos esta fecha. Ya en el trailer se ve que es una belleza. Viva México y latinoamerica. <3",0,0

1ZNZY-gd3K0,I have lived in Arizona my entire life. Arpaio has always been a controversial asshole but just overall I am have extremely disappointed in my state the last few years. I never thought Trump would win the electoral college here. I just thought after all these years dispute the efforts of arpaio racism had gotten better and that just from Trump border wall/racism nonsense during the primaries he would lose here.  However nope he won dispute the results actually being fairly close dispute some heavy bias(fuck you sun city). As a result he has ever since acted as he if the state of Arizona and his residents are his number one supporters. We are not but It sometimes scares me how many people support him and in the case of arpaio how they are completely okay with racist shit.  I like Arizona from its distinct culture to its geography but never in my life been so ashamed of my state.,0,0

I guess that the main drawback of having decency and values is that it limits your behavior to decency when indecent individuals can do whatever the hell they please.

Soon, Europes are going to be swamped by terrorists!  \\n\\nToday, I was sitting in a restaurant and I happen to sit next to a Muslim woman covered from head to toe, except her eyes were not covered.

bvim4rsNHkQ,"_Remarks by the President Signing an Executive Order on the National Space Council_\\nRoosevelt Room\\nJune 30, 2017 3:13 P.M. EDT  \\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  Thank you, very much.  You don't mind if I do that?  Get rid of it.  (Laughter.)  \\n\\nThank you very much to our great Vice President and also for the fantastic job that Mike has been doing.  \\n\\nThe future of American space leadership -- we're going to lead again.  It’s been a long time.  It’s over 25 years, and we're opening up, and we are going to be leading again like we've never led before.\\n\\nWe’re a nation of pioneers, and the next great American frontier is space.  And we never completed -- we started, but we never completed.  We stopped.  But now we start again.  And we have tremendous spirit, and we're going to have tremendous spirit from the private sector -- maybe in particular from the private sector.\\n\\nI’d like to extend a special welcome to an American hero who’ve I’ve known actually for a long time, Buzz Aldrin, who is with us today.  (Applause.)  Known him a long time.  Thank you also to Astronauts Benjamin Drew and David Wolf and former NASA Flight Director Gene Kranz for being with us and for working with us on exactly what we're doing today.  Thank you all very much. We appreciate it.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  (Applause.) \\n\\nWe're also joined by our great Secretary of Commerce, Wilbur Ross, who spent the morning negotiating trade deals with South Korea.  And as you know, that trade deal is coming due, and it actually came due a couple of weeks ago.  And I think we're going to make a good deal, right? \\n\\nSECRETARY ROSS:  We've made some progress.\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  I think so.  That's what the word is.  And good for both countries.\\n\\nAlso distinguished members of Congress are with us, and leaders of several of America’s great aerospace companies.  \\n\\nToday, we’re taking a crucial step to secure America’s future in space by reviving the National Space Council after it was -- has been dormant almost 25 years if you can believe it.\\n\\nDuring the campaign, Vice President Pence promised that our administration -- because Mike is very much into space -- would revive the National Space Council, and with this executive order, we’re keeping that promise.  Feel very strongly about it.  I’ve felt strongly about it for a long time.  I used to say before doing what I did -- I used to say, what happened?  Why aren’t we moving forward?\\n\\nToday’s announcement sends a clear signal to the world that we are restoring America’s proud legacy of leadership in space.\\n\\nOur Vice President cares very deeply about space policy, and for good reason -- space exploration is not only essential to our character as a nation, but also our economy and our great nation’s security.  \\n\\nOur travels beyond the Earth propel scientific discoveries that improve our lives in countless ways here, right here, at home:  powering vast new industry, spurring incredible new technology, and providing the space security we need to protect the American people.  And security is going to be a very big factor with respect to space and space exploration.  At some point in the future, we’re going to look back and say how did we do it without space? \\n\\nThe Vice President will serve as the council’s chair.  Several representatives of my administration will join him including the Secretaries of State, Defense, Commerce, Transportation, and Homeland Security; the Chairman of the great -- I’ll tell you, he’s doing a fantastic job, always working, always fighting, and winning -- winning big against ISIS, that I can tell you, seeing what’s happening there -- the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Security Advisor, NASA, and the Director of National Intelligence. \\n\\nThe council will also draw the expertise of other White House offices as well as insights from scientists, innovators, and business leaders from across the country.  Many business leaders that want to be a big part of this.  I think the privatization of certain aspects is going to play a very crucial role, don’t you think?  They are truly into it.  This coordination will be accomplished through an advisory group that is being convened by today’s executive order, which I’ll be signing in a minute.  \\n\\nThe National Space Council will be a central hub guiding space policy within the administration.  And I will draw on it for advice and information and recommendations for action.  And the Vice President, myself, and a few others are going to pick some private people to be on the board.  I will say that’s not easy because everybody wants to be on this board.  People that you wouldn’t have believed loved what we’re doing so much they want to -- some of the most successful people in the world want to be on this board.    \\n\\nThe human soul yearns for discovery.  By unlocking the mysteries of the universe, we unlock truths within ourselves.  That’s true.  Our journey into space will not only make us stronger and more prosperous, but will unite us behind grand ambitions and bring us all closer together.  Wouldn’t that be nice?  Can you believe that space is going to do that?  I thought politics would do that.  (Laughter.)  Well, we’ll have to rely on space instead. \\n\\nEvery launch into the skies is another step forward toward a future where our differences seem small against the vast expanse of our common humanity.  Sometimes you have to view things from a distance in order to see the real truth.  It is America’s destiny to be at the forefront of humanity’s eternal quest for knowledge and to be the leader amongst nations on our adventure into the great unknown.  And I could say the great and very beautiful unknown.  Nothing more beautiful.  \\n\\nWith the actions we are launching today, America will think big once again.  Important words:  Think big.  We haven’t been thinking so big for a long time, but we’re thinking big again as a county.  We will inspire millions of children to carry on this proud tradition of American space leadership -- and they’re excited -- and to never stop wondering, hoping, and dreaming about what lies beyond the stars.\\n\\nSo, I just want to tell you that we are now going to sign an executive order, and this is going to launch a whole new chapter for our great country.  And people are very excited about it and I can tell you, I’m very excited about it.  Thank you all very much.  (Applause.)  \\n\\n(The order is signed.)\\n  \\nCOLONEL ALDRIN:  Infinity and beyond.  (Laughter.)\\n\\nTHE PRESIDENT:  This is infinity here.  It could be infinity.  We don’t really don’t know.  But it could be.  It has to be something -- but it could be infinity, right?\\n\\nOkay.  (Applause.)",0,0

It would show the successes are that much sweeter.\\n\\nWas a bit disappointed there was nothing like that in any of exhibits at Kennedy Space Center, but I suppose in NASA's case they don't want to show the down-side where sometimes lives were lost. (Astronauts are well aware and willing to take those risks. The appeal of what they're doing isn't without sacrifice.)

74zJ4scJzNs,"This is not very well thought out... First of all obviously Joey ISNT the father of the actors. Yes it is strange that all of the children had blonde hair but at the same time they were children when they were casted, and hair can change when they age, for instance i was born with red hair but it changed to blonde then auburn and then a dark more brown auburn, my mom has auburn hair that was more red and my dad has black brown hair, which made it darker then my moms but with red undertones still.\\n\\n DJ was more of a dirty blonde which could be due to their mothers AND the fact that Dannys mom was i believe is a blonde as well, which makes his brown a bit less dominant. Dannys children being blonde is not illogical because his hair may have been more blonde during early childhood. As far as Uncle Jesse's children, the mother was blonde, and Jesse's sister was blonde, which means he carries the genetic trait. I dont know about you but you need the other genes from ancestors to come to that conclusion as definite.\\n Also isn't it more weird to think they'd both cheat on a talkshow host(Danny) and a band member(Jesse) for Joey the cartoony comedian. Plus the fact that they got blonde haired actors on purpose to make it harder to forget their mother and so they each had a part of her, to torment Danny and Jesse, by having a constant reminder of her. If you want to discuss a theory at least think it out first.",0,0

74zJ4scJzNs,"OBJECTION! Danny's mother, who appears multiple times on the show including the first episode, is shown to be blonde. Thus, according to my 9th grade biology class, makes it so there is a higher chance of the girls having blonde hair as he carries the recessive gene, as does Rebecca and Jesse as, if I remember correctly, Rebecca's mother is also blonde and as Pam is blonde then that means Jesse also holds the gene. Not to mention we find out Becky's expecting only seven episodes after the wedding episode with the wiki stating that the twins were born the day the episode they were born on aired which was 9 months and 2 weeks after the wedding episode aired. This evidence concludes that the twins could have been conceived during the honeymoon and were late or conceived after the honeymoon when Becky and Jesse lived in a different house for about a week. Meaning there was no possible time for when Joey could have slept with Becky. We must also take into account that DJ's kids, except the baby, all have dark hair. Plus, in episode 1 of season 4, Jesse's grandparents come to visit the also bring a young cousin named Melina who looks exactly like Michelle, as she was played by one of the twins but this is about genetics.Therefore this theory is hogwash. I rest my case and frankly spent far too much of my time debunking this theory.",0,0

Wow, call the press, the aluminati is real, bob the builder is shaped like a dick because Tom Cruise is an alien, everything is a flase flag and the government leaves clues everywhere so sheeple can find the truth, tupac isnt dead, Jay-z is a reptilian and the leader of the illuminati and HAARP opened up portals creating the Mandela Effect.

Nonwhites are expected to become the majority of the nation's children by 2020, as our colleague Bill Chappell reported last year.

The newest estimate shows that on July 1, 2015, the population of racial or ethnic minority babies was 50.2 percent.\\nBut the scales may have actually tipped in 2013 — the Census Bureau often revises past population estimates as new data become available. That means the first of these babies are now preschool-aged.\\n\\nWe've already been seeing this shift in U.S. schools: the 2014-15 school year marked the first time that minority student enrollment in public schools surpassed that of white students.\\n\\nNPR could not reach any babies for comment.\\n\\n\\n BLACKS.... we don't die we multiply 🤷🏾‍♂️",0,0

I am sure everyone who perform in AGT is great, but you are the greatest. Whatever you are going to be, always give your song to become a bless to everyone. Don't care about the haters. Haters are haters. They will always see you in different sides. They choose their life for that. They just wanted to show how they care to their favorite one, or if they do not have any in AGT, probably they are created as people who dislike you because lotsa people love you.  So, Use them as your strength to give the best to your fans. Angelica, you are already the winner. Good luck for the next performance. Greetings from Indonesia.",2,0

74zJ4scJzNs,"Genetics aren't that simple.   Depending on the parents of the dark haired parent, if one is blonde for example, the gene for blonde hair can be stronger.

This means more of the woman's genes will be carried over.",0,0

74zJ4scJzNs,"This is not very well thought out... First of all obviously Joey ISNT the father of the actors. Yes it is strange that all of the children had blonde hair but at the same time they were children when they were casted, and hair can change when they age, for instance i was born with red hair but it changed to blonde then auburn and then a dark more brown auburn, my mom has auburn hair that was more red and my dad has black brown hair, which made it darker then my moms but with red undertones still.\\n\\n DJ was more of a dirty blonde which could be due to their mothers AND the fact that Dannys mom was i believe is a blonde as well, which makes his brown a bit less dominant. Dannys children being blonde is not illogical because his hair may have been more blonde during early childhood. As far as Uncle Jesse's children, the mother was blonde, and Jesse's sister was blonde, which means he carries the genetic trait. I dont know about you but you need the other genes from ancestors to come to that conclusion as definite.\\n Also isn't it more weird to think they'd both cheat on a talkshow host(Danny) and a band member(Jesse) for Joey the cartoony comedian. Plus the fact that they got blonde haired actors on purpose to make it harder to forget their mother and so they each had a part of her, to torment Danny and Jesse, by having a constant reminder of her. If you want to discuss a theory at least think it out first.",0,0

bvim4rsNHkQ,"Next up: Mars!  Now if only SpaceX would think outside the box a bit and start work on developing Propulsive Fluid Accumulators (which can be solar-powered if they are kept at a high enough operating-altitude) and orbital fuel depots to store the surplus Liquid Oxygen they collect.\\nPropulsive Fluid Accumulators are entirely technologically feasible.  Their main requirements are powerful microgravity vacuum-pumps, cryogenic cooling-systems, any kind of electric thruster that can operate on Nitrogen (N2), and orbital fuel-transfer and storage systems.\\nPFA's basically operate by scooping up the residual gasses that can be found in the Thermosphere at altitudes encompassing parts of Low Earth Orbit (most Propulsive Fluid Accumulator proposals suggest operating at significantly lower altitudes than the International Space Station- which already encounters significant drag from residual atmosphere and even has a Night-Glide mode for its solar panels to reduce drag during the part of its orbit where the Earth blocks the Sun from reaching the panels...) and cryogenically-storing those gasses.  The Nitrogen collected is used for propulsion- both to fight drag and for maneuvers to rendezvous with other spacecraft- while the Oxygern collected is cryogenically stored so it can be used to refuel other spacecraft- which is the main purpose of a Propulsive Fluid Accumulator...\\nSpaceX *ALREADY* needs to develop orbital-refueling technology for the ITS plan to reach Mars, so developing Propulsive Fluid Accumulators would be an exceedingly USEFUL way to gain experience with orbital-refueling technology first...  And if Propulsive Fluid Accumulators prove cost-effective enough, they could completely revolutionize space travel, by nearly QUADRUPLING the propellant-mass available to any Kero/LOX spacecraft to reach orbit (as Kero/LOX us only 22% RP-1 at stochiometric ratio), and increasing the propellant-mass available to Hydro/LOX stages to reach orbit nearly nine-fold (as 8 times as much Oxygen mass is required as Hydrogen for a Hydro/LOX engine burning at stochiometric ratio...)  Why carry your Liquid Oxygen with you to Low Earth Orbit when a Propulsive Fluid Accumulator can harvest it for you in-situ instead? (In a way, this is a branch of In Situ Resource Utilization and relies on the principle of mass-leveraging to increase your available mass-budgets...)",1,0

CYoRmfI0LUc,"Today's generation of schoolchildren looks much different than one just a few decades ago. Nonwhites are expected to become the majority of the nation's children by 2020, as our colleague Bill Chappell reported last year. This is now the reality among the very youngest Americans: babies.\\n\\nBabies of color now outnumber non-Hispanic white babies (1 year or younger), according to new estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau. The newest estimate shows that on July 1, 2015, the population of racial or ethnic minority babies was 50.2 percent.\\nBut the scales may have actually tipped in 2013 — the Census Bureau often revises past population estimates as new data become available. That means the first of these babies are now preschool-aged.\\n\\nWe've already been seeing this shift in U.S. schools: the 2014-15 school year marked the first time that minority student enrollment in public schools surpassed that of white students.\\n\\nNPR could not reach any babies for comment.\\n\\n\\n BLACKS.... we don't die we multiply 🤷🏾‍♂️",1,0

cOlibbx5sx0,I have so little faith in the current American government to do the right thing for anyone anymore. Not even a shred of human decency in these people. The Trump administration has really revealed to the world how despicable Republicans really are.,3,0
cOlibbx5sx0,I think Jimmy actually spent more time coming up with this monologue than the Republicans spent coming up with this latest Healthcare bill:  Tax cuts for the Top 1% .  Yep.  That checks all the boxes.,1,0
cOlibbx5sx0,This bill likely is going to get passed however it should add an amendment where it only drops the individual mandate for us citizens who are the voters who cast ballots. The 13.3m lawful permanent residents (LPRs)/Green card holders or so in the US should still face the current Obamacare fines if they don't receive insurance from their employer or purchase it on the individual market based on the minimum provisions in their state of residency. Those 13M+ assumed enrollments should further help stabilize national insurance markets so the Americans who choose to buy insurance can see some more spreading of risk which ultimately should lead to somewhat lower premiums. This would also incentivize LPRs not to go on state medicaid rolls and increase their incomes above the eligibility requirement because they will have health insurance regardless (medicaid/or purchase it to avoid fine). Obviously the poorest/sickest in this group should still be able to apply for a hardship exception if they can't get insurance to avoid a fine. Then they can apply for medicaid. Majority of America hates the individual mandate but only the citizens can vote with their rage and feet. And having health insurance in general is in the best interest of the LPRs regardless. The libertarians among them will have the incentive to naturalize into citizens faster so they don't have to be inclined to buy insurance or face fines.,1,0
cOlibbx5sx0,Meanwhile CNN is talking about Trump's golf meme. Thanks for holding our elected officials accountable Jimmy.,1,0

cOlibbx5sx0,"Thank you for standing up to these cruel people with zero empathy for the disabled, elderly, children, pregnant women of ALL classes, and people who can't afford to be punished for simply being ill or disabled. How dare these republicans pretend to be Christians and yet they're nothing like Jesus but so much like the devil. Money is their god and they'd worship a golden cow if they thought they'd get some kind of kick back from it. This is repulsive to even try to punish the most in need people in our nation who are already struggling more than the rest of society with terrible health issues. You people who support this cruel stuff I hope to God you become disabled or sick for life and I hope it's a painful health issue and you find yourself with NO insurance.

It wasn't your basic superhero movie with CGI etc. Someone should take similar action with video game movies and break the cycle. I know creating something new might seem difficult and daunting as we saw with Assassin's Creed. But they lost their way with the 85% modern day stuff.

N_zDcuX1Y54,Completely agree about it being matte for dry skin. I experiment with different beauty oils at work and find that Korres Wild Rose Oil and Tatcha's Oil mixed make this foundation more comfortable and wearable. I do 2 drops to warm up and prep on my skin. Then Fenty primer and then 1-2 pumps of foundation with 2 drops of oil mixed in. Then the foundation will dry down to a natural soft luminous matte look for dryer skin. It's beautiful 😍 Try it with an oil 💕,0,0

That a woman that gorgeous could be so badass. Now Lara Croft looks like a 14 year-old girl. I will give Vikander this though - her British accent is equally as bad as Jolie's was. Otherwise - I'll pass. She's not believable as an action hero and I really can't get over the fact that she looks like a teenager girl and the characters supposed to be 21 and she's 27 in real life.

8ndhidEmUbI,"God’s Message To Mankind By Maester Patrick \\n(I.S.o.B.P. - International School of Biblical Prophecy - Youtube.com/ISOBP )\\n\\nAccept This Gift: Pray to Jesus and Ask for Your sins to be Covered then Seek Water Baptism.\\n\\nGOD LOVES YOU. However, God does not Condone your sins. “Good” people Have Committed Sins as well. As You have not lived a Perfect life. Nor has Anyone else. Your sins have Made you a Sinner before God. The Penalty for Your sins is the Curse of Death.\\nHowever there Is Good news: Someone who never Committed a sin, Can be Your Substitution, such a Person May Carry Your Judgment for Your sins, In Your place.\\nGod’s Love for You Inspired Him to send His son, Who’s capable of Living a Life Without Sin, and made him undergo the curse of Death in your place.\\nThis is How Eternal Life becomes Accessible to you. As Jesus, Gods son, Never Committed A sin during His Earthly Life, so By the Law of Sin and Death, God was obligated to resurrect Him, Rightfully, as that Law Only Applies to Sinners.\\nEternal life Cannot be Obtained by means of Money, Nor is there a way to “Earn” the right that God Pardons you from the Curse of Death with your Own Efforts of Recompense for Your Sins. You are unable to “Deserve” it, It’s a Gift from God.\\nIts Up to You to Choose if you Accept this Gift, and When You do so, God Arranged the Forgiveness of your sins and Will Choose to Forget that You ever Committed Them.\\nThose Who Accept this Gift will Become Sons and Daughters of God, and No Longer be Separated From Him. Such will Receive Access to the Holy Spirit and Will Dwell in Heaven with God in the Afterlife.\\nAfter your reunition with GOD, the Holy Spirit Will Help You To Not Return to that old Lifestyle of Committing Sins, Lest You Become Separated from God Again, Nor should You Desire To Be found Abusing God’ Grace Upon You.\\n\\nSOURCE:  Psalm 100:5, Deuteronomy 28, Romans 3:23, Isaiah 59:2, Hebrews 4:15, 2 Corinth 5:21 Hebrews 9:12, John 11:25, Galatians 2:16, Ephesians 2:8, Isaiah 43:25, Galatians 3:26, Romans 6:12, Romans 6:14, Leviticus 26, 1 John 1:8, Romans 6:23, Romans 10:15, Romans5:8, John 3:16, John 17:3, Romans 8:2, Romans 10:13, Acts 2:38, 2 Corinth 5:18, Philippians 3:20, Galatians 2:17-21, Romans 6:15.",1,0

cHbkEESIl7g,"When I saw Brienne and Arya fight, I couldn't help but think back to the Meereen fighting pit scene where Hizdahr zo Loraq says that the bigger person almost always ends up defeating the smaller person. However skilled and quick Arya might be, Brienne's advantages in terms of strength and wingspan give her an enormous advantage in close combat. In truth, someone huge like Brienne would defeat someone tiny like Arya quite easily for the most part. Unfortunately, GOT has a habit of ditching realism for the sake of wishful thinking quite often, as it does when Jon Snow mows effortlessly through dozens of attacking soldiers at the Battle of the Bastards, or when Brienne and Podrick defeat Stannis's soldiers though greatly outnumbered.",0,0

Read the following verses carefully, then think, meditate and reflect among entire mankind in order to maintain the harmony of human unity as well as to annihilate riot, bloodshed, discriminations and all such mischievous activities. Remember that 1000 species of Lord’s creatures are praying and glorifying Him by their souls. Therefore, it is the inevitable duty of mankind bestowed with intelligence to act in order to keep the earth and universe in its equilibrium utilizing Adhikr—the Balance and Trust from the Impartial Lord.\\n\\n4: 1\\n*Oh mankind, heed your Lord Who has created you from a single soul, and created its mate from it, and from them both scattered so many men and women; and heed Allah about Whom you will be asked, and heed the wombs; certainly Allah is ever watching over you.*\\n\\nThe soul of everyone is from the Lord itself. None has the right to select their parents or children. So there is no chance for partiality among mankind. The ‘aim of life’ should be to identify the Lord, confirm oneself as believer and to prepare Paradise in the 4th phase in order to inherit it in the 7th phase utilizing Adhikr—the Insight.\\n\\n53: 45-46\\n*He is the One Who creates in pairs male and female, when the semen drop is emitted.*\\n\\nNo one has the right to select sex (gender). Lord is the owner of the body as well as the soul. So there shouldn’t be any differentiation between male and female.\\n\\n30:21\\n*And among His signs that He created for you mates among yourselves, for you may dwell in tranquility with them, and He has put love and mercy between you; indeed in that, there are clear evidences for the people who think and reflect.*\\n\\nSo sexual intercourse should only be conducted in between male and female from the mankind, and it should be in between the married spouses. All others who do sodomy, unmarried sexual activities etc. are Mujrims (madmen who don’t think and reflect the aim of life).\\n\\n64: 2\\n*He is the One Who created you all, and among you there is disbeliever and among you there is believer; and Allah is observing whatever you do.*\\n\\nEach individual has to utilize Adhikr to become a believer. All others who received the Book are disbelievers.\\n\\n76: 3\\n*Indeed, We gave him option to select the way, either to be grateful or ungrateful.*\\n\\nSince the Lord is Impartial everyone has the right to be grateful or ungrateful, and therefore even the parents have no right to compel their children to become so and so.\\n\\n2: 256\\n*There should be no compulsion in ‘Dheen’ (religion), the right way has been made clear from the wrong way; therefore whoever rejects with the arrogant ones and believes with Allah has grasped the Firmest Rope which will never break, Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.*\\n\\n‘Firmest Rope’ which is extended from the Paradise to the earth is Adhikr. Without testifying It nobody becomes believer and enters to the paradise. Read together 31: 22.\\n\\n25: 68\\n*The beloved servants of Allah don’t appeal to any other deity besides Allah, nor kill any soul whom Allah has forbidden except for Truth, and will not fornicate; if anyone does so, he is fallen in crimes.*\\n\\nThe believer who considers Lord as impartial shouldn’t kill any soul (living thing). Believer shall not undergo or wish to undergo sexual intercourse with others than his/her spouse.\\n\\nFrom the Book  The Ultimate victory is for Islam….

The whole point of the newer Tomb Raider games (which this looks to be based off of) is that Lara finds inner strength to continue on.  Sure, she knows how to shoot guns and stuff, but she doesn't go to the island expecting to use any, and her first time killing someone comes as quite a shock to her.  She shouldn't be billy bad ass at the beginning of the movie, but instead be an intelligent, normal young woman.

ceLV1v3mV4E,"It's interesting you say it feels like body butter.  In the past, mothers used to use Crisco or lard as a skin protectant on their kids to prevent diaper rash, it was also used for dry skin or chapped lips.  It was readily available and fancy creams were not common.  In norther climates it was used to prevent frostbite.  When I was a kid if my mother had the Crisco out, I'd snitch a bit on my finger to eat.  I rarely ever use it these days unless its called for in a recipe.  Now I usually use Olive oil to cook with (which can also be used on the skin, but you will smell like it all day long).",0,0

There's just no way. Cool knife flip though",6,0
cHbkEESIl7g,"Biggest gripe for this is Arya's using the small sword, a strictly thrusting weapon, with slashes. Brienne could completely disregard the swats from the triangular steel rod, even without the armor. Certainly not the worst fight we've seen, but not the best, either.",0,0

cHbkEESIl7g,"When I saw Brienne and Arya fight, I couldn't help but think back to the Meereen fighting pit scene where Hizdahr zo Loraq says that the bigger person almost always ends up defeating the smaller person. However skilled and quick Arya might be, Brienne's advantages in terms of strength and wingspan give her an enormous advantage in close combat. In truth, someone huge like Brienne would defeat someone tiny like Arya quite easily for the most part. Unfortunately, GOT has a habit of ditching realism for the sake of wishful thinking quite often, as it does when Jon Snow mows effortlessly through dozens of attacking soldiers at the Battle of the Bastards, or when Brienne and Podrick defeat Stannis's soldiers though greatly outnumbered.",0,0

cHbkEESIl7g,"That's crazy. I was totally impressed when I saw 0:50 in that actual episode, because I thought Maisie really did the hop back on her feet since they showed her face without cutting from a different shot. I didn't realize it was a stunt double with CG of Maisie's face added onl. It's scary what they can do with CGI these days and how realistic/unnoticeable it is. Great for movies, shows, and other forms of entertainment, but if it's used for other purposes (i.e. false evidence).... it's scary.",1,0

XSCneVakGGk,"*HARMONY OF HUMAN UNITY*\\n\\nOh man! Read the following verses carefully, then think, meditate and reflect among entire mankind in order to maintain the harmony of human unity as well as to annihilate riot, bloodshed, discriminations and all such mischievous activities. Remember that 1000 species of Lord’s creatures are praying and glorifying Him by their souls. Therefore, it is the inevitable duty of mankind bestowed with intelligence to act in order to keep the earth and universe in its equilibrium utilizing Adhikr—the Balance and Trust from the Impartial Lord.\\n\\n4: 1\\n*Oh mankind, heed your Lord Who has created you from a single soul, and created its mate from it, and from them both scattered so many men and women; and heed Allah about Whom you will be asked, and heed the wombs; certainly Allah is ever watching over you.*\\n\\nThe soul of everyone is from the Lord itself. None has the right to select their parents or children. So there is no chance for partiality among mankind. The ‘aim of life’ should be to identify the Lord, confirm oneself as believer and to prepare Paradise in the 4th phase in order to inherit it in the 7th phase utilizing Adhikr—the Insight.\\n\\n53: 45-46\\n*He is the One Who creates in pairs male and female, when the semen drop is emitted.*\\n\\nNo one has the right to select sex (gender). Lord is the owner of the body as well as the soul. So there shouldn’t be any differentiation between male and female.\\n\\n30:21\\n*And among His signs that He created for you mates among yourselves, for you may dwell in tranquility with them, and He has put love and mercy between you; indeed in that, there are clear evidences for the people who think and reflect.*\\n\\nSo sexual intercourse should only be conducted in between male and female from the mankind, and it should be in between the married spouses. All others who do sodomy, unmarried sexual activities etc. are Mujrims (madmen who don’t think and reflect the aim of life).\\n\\n64: 2\\n*He is the One Who created you all, and among you there is disbeliever and among you there is believer; and Allah is observing whatever you do.*\\n\\nEach individual has to utilize Adhikr to become a believer. All others who received the Book are disbelievers.\\n\\n76: 3\\n*Indeed, We gave him option to select the way, either to be grateful or ungrateful.*\\n\\nSince the Lord is Impartial everyone has the right to be grateful or ungrateful, and therefore even the parents have no right to compel their children to become so and so.\\n\\n2: 256\\n*There should be no compulsion in ‘Dheen’ (religion), the right way has been made clear from the wrong way; therefore whoever rejects with the arrogant ones and believes with Allah has grasped the Firmest Rope which will never break, Allah is All Hearing, All Knowing.*\\n\\n‘Firmest Rope’ which is extended from the Paradise to the earth is Adhikr. Without testifying It nobody becomes believer and enters to the paradise. Read together 31: 22.\\n\\n25: 68\\n*The beloved servants of Allah don’t appeal to any other deity besides Allah, nor kill any soul whom Allah has forbidden except for Truth, and will not fornicate; if anyone does so, he is fallen in crimes.*\\n\\nThe believer who considers Lord as impartial shouldn’t kill any soul (living thing). Believer shall not undergo or wish to undergo sexual intercourse with others than his/her spouse.\\n\\nFrom the Book  The Ultimate victory is for Islam…. But not through Muslims!!! \\n\\nVisit www.straightpathonline.com",0,0

74zJ4scJzNs,"There's another explanation for this that people constantly seem to over look or misunderstand.\\n\\nThe fact that your genetics come from your parents doesn't literally mean that you have to look to literally look like your mom or dad. Everyone has dormant sets of DNA that don't effect their own appearance but can still be passed down to their children. This means that if their grandparents are blond then it actually becomes a lot more likely for them to also be blond.\\n\\nBasically it's 50/50 because you're only looking at mom and dad which is wrong. If you look at their parents you might see three blond grandparents, and one dark haired. This would make the chances for blond grandkids much higher. You keep going back generations and generations and the chances will likely keep getting higher.\\n\\nAnother thing to consider is that using your same logic, even if the chance was 50/50 that doesn't mean that they can't be blond three times in a row. The chance of them being girls was also 50/50 so by your own logic in saying they can't all be blond then you're also claiming that they can't all be girls.\\n\\n50/50 does not mean that every other child has to be blond just like there is no guarantee that if you have two kids that they're going to be 1 boy and 1 girl.\\n\\nSo this entire theory is based on a poor understanding of how science and probability work.",0,0

yj7OZ602CM8,"Ok, not sure if people have already covered this, as the comment thread is too long for me to bother looking, but...\\n\\nFirst of all, Chris White was not the lead singer of the Zombies. I think he did sing lead on a track or two (notably on Butcher's Tale on Odessey and Oracle, which he wrote), but the lead singer was primarily Colin Blunstone, with Rod Argent taking lead on a number of songs. Chris was the group's bassist and wrote a lot of their stuff.\\n\\nAlso, the timeline isn't really well represented here. Much later than the 1969 fake zombies, there was apparently a group touring around 1988(!) as the Zombies, and the original band didn't get back together to record albums, plural. They recorded one album in 1991, which the liner notes indicate was to protect the name of the band. Interestingly, Rod Argent and Paul Atkinson (keyboards and guitar, respectively) were listed as special guests on that album, not part of that record's official line-up.\\n\\nArgent and Blunstone started touring together in 2000 and released an album under their names in 2001. In 2004 they started playing as the Zombies again and have released a couple of albums under that name since. This year, the entire original band (minus Atkinson, who unfortunately passed away in 2004) for a tour celebrating the 50th anniversary of Odessey and Oracle. (Which was a fantastic show, incidentally.)\\n\\nAs far as who wins or loses here, it's probably important to note that, after the dissolution of the Zombies, Rod Argent went on to form Argent which had a pretty decent amount of success. Hold Your Head Up reached 5 on the charts and anyone alive at that time has it stuck in their heads for the rest of their lives (trust me on this). Heck, Kiss even covered one of their songs. Chris White didn't play much with Argent, but did do a bunch of writing and producing.\\n\\nCome on guys, I expect better research from you. :-)",1,0

She looks the part, has the accent down and tbh it's unfair not to give her a chance before actually seeing how well she does in the movie. This could be awesome. We don't know.

N_zDcuX1Y54,"Where as I can respect your opinion, perhaps you could have expressed a bit more your skin type.

I think it is important to stress things of this nature instead of...not liking this or that.  Please keep in mind, I am a dry skinned girl and for that reason I didn't purchase.

N_zDcuX1Y54,"Okay so a few tips:\\nUse less primer!! All you need is a pump and a half. Also, try applying the foundation with a brush next time...it blends better and if you stipple it, you can smooth out any streaks. \\n\\nWith the Matchstix, they're cream to powder so you have to warm them up first with your fingers first (even if you're gonna swipe them on and use a brush to blend), and press them into your undereye with your fingers! They melt in better that way (coming from someone who has to hydrate her undereye area with oil!).\\n\\nTry the primer/foundation/stix again?\\nxo 🖤",0,0

N_zDcuX1Y54,Online it said if you're using the blender and want the full full coverage leave the blender dry but if you want medium buildable coverage dampen the sponge hope this helps :) and the foundation and concealer is made for oily skin,0,0
N_zDcuX1Y54,I don't like wearing highlighter under my eyes or on my cheek bone but I also noticed that people are going in so heavy with Trophy Wife and saying its too pigmented. Its applied better with a eye blending brush and a light dab in the pan. I think Rihanna may have made it like that knowing people of a lower income all over the world who support the brand will get the maximum bang for their buck. How long would Trophy Wife last for a young girl in Barbados who can't run out and buy every palette that gets released? I'm guessing if you buy Trophy Wife you really don't need to buy any other highlighter.,0,0

N_zDcuX1Y54,well it's not full coverage and the concealer is dark because it is supposed to look natural. Not a brand for drag queens,0,0

He was never even on any of the band's record covers or press releases.  Heck, he never even recorded in the same studio with the rest of the band!

oSRXEHsORZo,"After a whirlwind romance and crime spree, Jason and his girlfriend's undoing comes via a tragic gas line explosion. It would seem that fate itself wanted them dead, as they were killed right as they were making yet another successful getaway by a seemingly random occurrence. Angered at the cruel trick fate has played on him, Jason rises as a vengeful spirit, ready to command his army of the damned to search this life and the next until he can be reunited with his lady love.\\n\\nAnd then they dance and shit. It's pretty cool too.",5,0

I love the zombies - their album Odessy and Oracle is a masterpiece and they just did a 50th anniversary tour for it and they actually did break up and came back full force- they released a few new albums in the last couple of years actually and they made it into the billboard charts again. This was great but yknow... You could have dug a lil deeper ;P,0,0

He was never even on any of the band's record covers or press releases.  Heck, he never even recorded in the same studio with the rest of the band!  He recorded the lead vocals on many of the songs and the rest of the tracks were recorded at different times in different studios!

Remove from the heat and sprinkle in the yeast and 1/4 teaspoon sugar (don't stir). Set aside until foamy, 5 minutes. Whisk in the melted butter, egg yolk and vanilla.\\n\\nWhisk the flour, the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, the salt and nutmeg in the bowl of a stand mixer. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture. Mix on low speed with the dough hook until thick and slightly sticky. Knead on medium speed until the dough gathers around the hook, 6 minutes. (Add up to 2 more tablespoons flour if necessary.)\\n\\nRemove the dough and shape into a ball. Butter the mixer bowl and return the dough to the bowl, turning to coat with butter. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, 1 hour 15 minutes.\\n\\nRoll out the dough, fill and cut into buns (see instructions below). Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan; place the buns cut-side down in the pan, leaving space between each. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, 40 minutes. Preheat the oven to 325.\\n\\nBake the buns until golden brown, about 35 minutes. Cool in the pan 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the glaze: Sift the confectioners' sugar into a bowl, then whisk in the cream and melted butter. Transfer the buns to a rack and spoon the glaze on top while still warm.\\n\\nHow to Form Cinnamon Buns\\n\\n1. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 12-by-14-inch rectangle with the longer side facing you.\\n\\n2. Spread with the softened butter, leaving a 1/2-inch border on the far long edge. Mix the sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over the butter.\\n\\n3. Brush the unbuttered far edge with water. Roll the dough away from you into a tight cylinder and press on the long edge to seal.\\n\\n4. Cut the cylinder with a sharp knife to make 6 equal-size buns.",0,0

I guess the point is, you are still going to need to install a drain which directs water away from the entrance. Maybe hire a plumber to hang a condensate line, i'm in Canada, budget price for that (non-union), $400.

S_9OSktlm6s,This the most cliché trailer I have ever seen.\n\n0:02 - Starts with action scenes and questions\n0:27 - Action music begins with the clicking of something\n0:30 - Reading and impactful airhorn sounds begin playing\n0:32 - Question that doubts the capabilities of the protagonist\n0:37 - Optimistic response to question\n0:38 - Bunch of gunfire and explosions\n0:43 - More reading\n0:44 - Question that is answered with a pessimistic answer that is shouted for no reason\n0:47 - Even more reading\n0:48 - Entire action scene (which is usually the best one in the movie) spoilt\n0:54 - Question by an important character that leaves protagonist split between two decisions\n\nHave a feeling this movie is gonna be a huge let down.,2,0

UApJ0enDJTs,I didn't know what I would think about this... I thought it would look like other people but I think it actually looks bizarre. Not bad not good but maybe normal? But then when I looked again it is actually distracting on you. I can't even put into words that make sense lol you look so good without them that I can't process your face with eyebrows haha,0,0

UApJ0enDJTs,"With your delicate features and fairer skin/eye/hair color, less is more.  The scant eyebrows #1 looked better to me.  The darker, thicker ones at the end were way too much.  Plus, what happens in a rain storm?  Your eyebrows would run!  Stay with what you have.  It works.",0,0
UApJ0enDJTs,"I'm sorry, but I gotta disagree with all these brows, especially the last one. 90s brows are not that sharp. Look at any model in the 90s and their brows are big, bushy, unkempt, slightly defined but they were big and bushy or the extreme opposite was very thin, plucked eyebrows, eg drew berrymore going through her awkward plucked phase.

UApJ0enDJTs,You look great either way but as an ex brow stylist I didn't think these styles suited you as much as it would if they where just a little but thinner.

cFVRCo6-FUU,"Ok, here's the thing. 1) I wish I could have been recruited to do this with you, as I am a pumpkin spice fiend. 2) Not everything Pumpkin flavored will taste like pumpkin pie/pumpkin spice. Pumpkin, itself, doesn't taste like pumpkin pie and you have to add all those awesome spices to it to make it that way. So, yes, some of these things are going to be kind of bland. Also, not all of these things are just Autumn specialties. There are many pumpkin things that are year round things. I've seen Pumpkin Raviolit in Trader Joe's in the middle of May. And Pumpkin butter is a thing you can find at some stores that aren't Trader Joe's even....year round. The Pumpkin Yogurt, Noosa makes amazing pumpkin yogurt and it's a year round thing (if your store carries it, it's amazing, try it). Last, but not least..go to Sprouts Farmers Market if you have one. Get the pumpkin snaps. Like ginger snaps, only pumpkin spice flavoured. Most amazing cookie. Quaker's Pumpkin Spice Oatmeal is f'ing amazing, sadly the Pumpkin Spice/Pumpkin Pie Kellogg's pop-tarts fell horribly flat (NEEDS MORE FILLING). The Pumpkin Spice/Pumpkin Pie Oreo's were a meh. They smelled amazing but...taste wise, I don't know. Was not that impressed. If you want to taste something really horrific, try Pumpkin Spice Cheerio's. Tastes like vomit. Edy's Pumpkin Ice Cream....MOST AMAZING THING!",0,0

I spilled a full glas of red vine over my 1 week old macbook pro (late 2013 bought it 2nd hand). i was frustrating and hated myself. you gave me confidence so i decided to open it up and repair it on my own. it was completly dead (even no light on the charger). i renew all damaged connections... some pins even vaporized when i heated them up because of the acid from the vine. i was lucky that i didn't need to buy any new components. i want to thank you for motivating people to do those repairs on their own, and you do well in showing that your skills are not special, actually everyone can do it with some practice. the microscope aswell the ultra sonic cleaner on my working place helped a lot of course... keep moving on - your repair videos are just fucking hilarious, i had to laugh a lot while i was realising i potentially lost 1000$. lots greetings from germany :)))) this message has been written on a water damaged macbook pro",6,0

c0FjpqLfGN8,"The unit isn't exactly leaking per se, its just hot and humid outside so water is accumulating on the evaporator coil. Looks like that is a packaged window AC which are intentionally slanted to the outside for drainage, rather than running a condensate drain line. Looks like whoever you hired, installed a piece of shit condensate line. The condensate drain can be done cheaply with soldered copper.  I guess the point is, you are still going to need to install a drain which directs water away from the entrance. Maybe hire a plumber to hang a condensate line, i'm in Canada, budget price for that (non-union), $400. Also, get a quote with a scope of work you both can sign off on, that way you can hold them to a copper line for instance, rather than taped tubes or whatever this guy used.

What did they charge ?    I would have installed a auxiliary condensate pump below it then ran the vinyl tubing to a downspout or corner to drain.  The purpose of an air conditioner is to remove humidity from a location.  The moisture leaves the evaporator coil and sent in this case to the condenser then flung into the condenser dropping head pressure and discharge temps.

7pOXunRYJIw,"Destin, I think the reason it failed was not necessarily due to the axial component of the stress alone.  It seems to me what happened is that the hoop direction stress stretched the acrylic until you lost enough thread engagement at the aft end for the axial to overcome the shear resistance of the threads due to not as much contact.  That would be my guess based on the fact that hoop direction stress in a cylinder under pressure is twice that of the axial stress (pressure x radius/2xthickness for axial vs (pressure x radius/thickness in hoop).",1,0

I guess the point is, you are still going to need to install a drain which directs water away from the entrance. Maybe hire a plumber to hang a condensate line, i'm in Canada, budget price for that (non-union), $400. Also, get a quote with a scope of work you both can sign off on, that way you can hold them to a copper line for instance, rather than taped tubes or whatever this guy used.

Liquid Nitrogen is -289 degrees F and non toxic, about 78% of our atmosphere. I wonder what would happen if the full cargo of such a ship were discharged in the eye of a Hurricane. It would create tremendous pressure as it returned to a gas plus it would crash the temperature. Would be interesting to see how much was required. The place to hit a Hurricane would be off the coast of Africa while it was still forming. The downside is that it might be that the Earth needs these storms and there might be some disastrous effect if we didn't have them.

ON3x2wWZLHk,"Tranquility, serenity and firmness. This was the order that the commanders of the Police transmitted to their agents in the briefing of the afternoon of Saturday and yesterday these they fulfilled with order. They did not respond to a single provocation, despite being literally sometimes cornered by an aggressive and provocative mass, perfectly organized by subjects that some attributed to being members of the Catalan National Assembly (ANC). At the end of the day, sad and hard because it showed the extent to which Catalan is a broken society, the secessionists had the photograph of the alleged police repression, which they longed for. And the Mossos, as they wanted, managed to avoid it even at the cost of seeming to forget their status as a Judicial Police. It was only late in the afternoon that there were reports that polls had been taken from schools.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Balmes Institute is on the Pau Claris street corner with Consell de Cent. At eight-thirty in the morning, a hundred people, some of them boys and girls as young as 15, waited for the doors of the center to open to vote. A few vans from the Police Intervention Units then made an appearance to comply with the order of the Superior Court of Justice of Catalonia: close the polling stations and requisition all the necessary material to carry out the illegal referendum.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSurgery\\nThe operation was surgical. Between shouts and insults the policemen were removing, one by one, all those who, from the ground, tried to prevent their access to the institute. A woman, in the middle of the thrusts, fell to the floor, otherwise wet and slippery. The cries of pain made the spirits even more unhappy, as well as the uncontrollable cries of the minors used by their own parents as human shields, and now, upon seeing the state of nerves of their offspring, they were carried back home, holding them responsible to the Police of what happened. It was no place for them, but the procès seems to justify everything.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHalf an hour later, it was over. The police withdrew with the ballot boxes, the documentation and the ballots between voices of outside the occupation forces! Or the streets will always be ours! And some career that another. Not one more problem. Of course, as soon as the agents left the political commissar on duty warned those present not to go home, there would be more ballot boxes and ballots. Democratic guarantees were the least; the butirreferendum, in the fortunate expression of some policemen, had to continue. By then the Generalitat had already announced that they could vote wherever they wanted, regardless of which electoral college they belonged to.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt complicates the situation\\nThe police knew that the first blow, relatively simple, was not going to be the general tone of the morning. The Mossos had already made it clear that they were not going to take a single effective measure to prevent the commission of the crime. And also, from the first moments it was perceived that the mobilization was going to be very important. Not even the heavy rain, which accentuated even more the gloom of the day, made the concentrates desist. This is already very difficult to fix, one of the police officers said before the new intervention: Catalan society is divided into two irreconcilable parts, and that is not a problem that can be solved by the Security Forces; is political. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEscola Diputació, at 114 of the street of the same name, was the next station of the Operation Copernicus, lived live on ABC. The arrival at that point, at nine-thirty in the morning, revealed to what extent secessionism had mobilized. The tails turned around the block. Entering now will be very complicated if you do not want to provoke a pitched battle, predicted one of the policemen. And many more agents were needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOnce again the manipulation of the weaker became evident. Inside the school were elderly people with reduced mobility, some of them arriving in wheelchairs amid the applause of those present. Once again a political commissary distributed slogans: Put the mobiles in plane mode!, He was disgusted, it seems that to try that those who acted from within tried to put in place the computer system, totally unused by the Security Forces ... It was all in vain, and after ten-thirty the voting began with the members of the table, pointing out the identity of the voters without further processing than presenting documentation that was not looked at either.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAt eleven-fifteen, the alarm sounded, when the presence of riot police was detected. The agents, always without their defense, and with the sole protection of their shields, closed the center block. The moods were exalted to the maximum. A few inches away, blinded with hatred, the congregation insulted, harassed, spat and vexed",0,0

If you where flying that slow though you probably be flying at all, you'd be falling.

O2pyRDQgVjk,"Basically, Hahn was a chemist, and so barium showing up, uninvited as it were, in the middle of his uranium preparation was a complete mystery.  Meitner was a nuclear physicist, and for her it was more a question of fitting the pieces together.  SciShow should have emphasized that she not only recognized that the barium indicated fission, but also determined that krypton was the other part (a noble gas, it would have been very difficult to find the way the barium was), and further determined the loss of weight in the nuclei from the original U-235 nucleus, and found that it accounted, through Einstein's formula, for the huge amount of kinetic energy released.  All done in her head, while on a skiing vacation over the Christmas holiday with her nephew when Hahn's communique arrived.\\n\\nAlso, she communicated the discovery to Nils Bohr who went to the US in early January to attend a physics conference, in which he passed the news on to all the physicists, native and alien, in America.  That including Ernest O. Lawrence, who carried it back to his lab in Berkeley, CA and reproduced the results there.  In this way the news spread much faster than the journals would have been able to do it.\\n\\nFinally, Enrico Fermi witnessed the same results 6 months before in his lab in Rome, but he mis-guessed about the what was happening. After describing his results incorrectly at a conference, he moved his family to America, and was present there to hear Bohr's news. He could have been the discoverer of fission.",0,0

O2pyRDQgVjk,"This video begins with an extremely unfortunate trope: accidental scientific discovery.  Scientific discoveries that can be reasonably called accidental are extremely rare.  Louis Pasteur wrote, Chance only favors the prepared mind.  Columbus, as an example, is commonly said to have accidentally blundered into the Americas.  Hogwash.  Columbus worked hard, over a considerable period, to assemble a voyage of discovery.  It was a perilous voyage, fraught with serious uncertainty and risk.  Had he not undertaken this perilous voyage, he could not have run into the Americas.  He could not, for example, have found the Americas by composing lute sonatas in Genoa.  Goodyear's discovery of vulcanization is similarly not at all accidental.  By his own account, he specifically set out to do experiments in an attempt to find a cure for the deficiencies of unvulcanized rubber.  His hot stove observation resulted from an early experiment involving heating rubber.  He continued a program of systematic experiments to develop a practical method of vulcanization.  There is also good reason to believe he benefited from the discoveries of others working on the same subject.\\n\\nIf the definition of accidental discovery is that it involves finding something one was not expecting, then that encompasses a very large fraction of all discoveries.  But, discoveries of any sort are highly unlikely to result from indolence.  Hahn, Meitner et al set out on a specific, difficult, detailed program of experiments to discover the effects of neutron irradiation of heavy elements.  Is it accidental that they found one of those effects?",0,1

Then a newton is defined as the the amount of force you need to exert to give an object 1 Joule of kinetic energy after pushing it 1 meter. Then you can define the kilogram as the amount of mass you have if pushing with 1 newton provides 1 m/s^2 of acceleration.\\n\\nYou could also define the joule in terms of the amount of energy released when a certain number of (~6.7e9) are annihilated with anti-protons, and follow the same logic. Or once you have the definition of the joule you can base the kilogram on the amount of mass that would need to be annihilated to get ~1.8e10 J of energy (1 kg matter, 1 kg antimatter, or 1 total kg of matter and antimatter if the energy is ~9e9).\\n\\nNo need for a new physical standard for mass, unless I'm missing something.",0,0

-otJ1LJGzcc,"This attack in Law Vegas was caused by someone using scopolamine on the attacker. Scopolamine is a powerful drug that once inhaled or ingested, removes free will from the victim; rendering them susceptible to suggestion. Someone blew the drug in his face, and told him to fire on those people. There is even a testimony from an eye witness that said two Spanish people made threats to the people at the venue 45 minutes prior to the shooting. I don't know if this drug was ever used in the previous shooting, but I do know that only law abiding citizens follow laws. There's a lot of talk about gun control or tougher regulations, but I think the only way to curb gun violence is to make gun ownership mandatory. You carry your identification around with you, why not a tiny pistol for your own defense? Robbery, rape, murder, and harassment would all go down if criminals even had the notion that 90% of citizens they preyed upon were armed. If you're a feminist, you definitely should support gun ownership. Men give us a lot more respect when they see a holster hanging from our bra line beneath our blouse. They stare at our tits anyway.

And the hotel just seems kinda off for the shooter to be coming from there.  Idk.. most of the time I’m not even phased by these because after it all I see these videos claiming it’s fake or false and so.. you just don’t know.

Small children fight in wars,\\n running from one position to another while laying down accurate fire with an ak-47 that weighs half as much as themselves.\\n I think a 64 year old man can handle firing an automatic weapon from a fixed position. Especially with a bi-pod. People talking about \\nhow the shots were too accurate for someone who is untrained. Again, bullshit. I think someone who is fluently proficient with\\nan automatic weapon would have killed a lot more people. There were thousands of people grouped together.

When you're being shot at you're going to hear 3 different sounds for every one bullet fired.\\n The sound of the bullet impact, the crack of the bullet mid-air when it breaks the sound barrier, and the muzzle burst itself. \\nNot to mention the echo from a gunshot at a distance. One automatic rifle CAN and DOES sound like multiple weapons being fired. \\nI can't claim to be certain of shit, and that's my point.

Bite marks, for example, surely are not completely random, so they could very well provide evidence - just not nearly as strong as previously stated and probably not enough to warrant a \\nconviction on their own.

O2pyRDQgVjk,"Basically, Hahn was a chemist, and so barium showing up, uninvited as it were, in the middle of his uranium preparation was a complete mystery.  Meitner was a nuclear physicist, and for her it was more a question of fitting the pieces together.  SciShow should have emphasized that she not only recognized that the barium indicated fission, but also determined that krypton was the other part (a noble gas, it would have been very difficult to find the way the barium was), and further determined the loss of weight in the nuclei from the original U-235 nucleus, and found that it accounted, through Einstein's formula, for the huge amount of kinetic energy released.  All done in her head, while on a skiing vacation over the Christmas holiday with her nephew when Hahn's communique arrived.\\n\\nAlso, she communicated the discovery to Nils Bohr who went to the US in early January to attend a physics conference, in which he passed the news on to all the physicists, native and alien, in America.  That including Ernest O. Lawrence, who carried it back to his lab in Berkeley, CA and reproduced the results there.  In this way the news spread much faster than the journals would have been able to do it.\\n\\nFinally, Enrico Fermi witnessed the same results 6 months before in his lab in Rome, but he mis-guessed about the what was happening. After describing his results incorrectly at a conference, he moved his family to America, and was present there to hear Bohr's news. He could have been the discoverer of fission.",0,0

O2pyRDQgVjk,"This video begins with an extremely unfortunate trope: accidental scientific discovery.  Scientific discoveries that can be reasonably called accidental are extremely rare.  Louis Pasteur wrote, Chance only favors the prepared mind.  Columbus, as an example, is commonly said to have accidentally blundered into the Americas.  Hogwash.  Columbus worked hard, over a considerable period, to assemble a voyage of discovery.  It was a perilous voyage, fraught with serious uncertainty and risk.  Had he not undertaken this perilous voyage, he could not have run into the Americas.  He could not, for example, have found the Americas by composing lute sonatas in Genoa.  Goodyear's discovery of vulcanization is similarly not at all accidental.  By his own account, he specifically set out to do experiments in an attempt to find a cure for the deficiencies of unvulcanized rubber.  His hot stove observation resulted from an early experiment involving heating rubber.  He continued a program of systematic experiments to develop a practical method of vulcanization.  There is also good reason to believe he benefited from the discoveries of others working on the same subject.\\n\\nIf the definition of accidental discovery is that it involves finding something one was not expecting, then that encompasses a very large fraction of all discoveries.  But, discoveries of any sort are highly unlikely to result from indolence.  Hahn, Meitner et al set out on a specific, difficult, detailed program of experiments to discover the effects of neutron irradiation of heavy elements.  Is it accidental that they found one of those effects?",0,1

Then a newton is defined as the the amount of force you need to exert to give an object 1 Joule of kinetic energy after pushing it 1 meter. Then you can define the kilogram as the amount of mass you have if pushing with 1 newton provides 1 m/s^2 of acceleration.\\n\\nYou could also define the joule in terms of the amount of energy released when a certain number of (~6.7e9) are annihilated with anti-protons, and follow the same logic. Or once you have the definition of the joule you can base the kilogram on the amount of mass that would need to be annihilated to get ~1.8e10 J of energy (1 kg matter, 1 kg antimatter, or 1 total kg of matter and antimatter if the energy is ~9e9).\\n\\nNo need for a new physical standard for mass, unless I'm missing something.",0,0

-q47sHA4eAo,"Jesus will rapture His faithful on the Feast of Trumpets in October 2017\\n\\nThe Jews didn't keep up with their own calendar. Big surprise with what we learn of them from the scriptures. This means the watchmen haven't been wrong about the timing of the rapture. What was wrong was the calendar due to it being shoddily put together ahead of time. \\n\\nWe know now that the Jews neither kept up their own calendar nor did they account for the leap year this year which pushes the Feast of Trumpets (and all of the Fall Feasts) back one month / lunar cycle.\\n\\nPremade calendars don't work well on God's timeline. We were one month early. The Feast of Trumpets hasn't even happened yet!\\n\\nCheck out Jerry Toney's video that explains the Hebrew leap year which pushes all of the Feast days, and everything else, back by an entire month / lunar cycle. This is done just days before the month is changed over. We had no idea it was even a thing until now.\\n\\nHere is Jerry Toney's video: https://youtu.be/h32TOHhUyB8\\n\\nJesus is still returning on the Feast of Trumpets this year! October 20th or 21st, 2017 when the new moon is sighted!\\n\\nDid you know that even the scoffers are fulfilling Biblical end times prophecy?\\n\\n2 Peter 3:3-4\\n3 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,\\n4 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation.\\n\\nJude 1:18\\nHow that they told you there should be mockers in the last time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.\\n\\nIf you want:\\n\\n- Proof the Bible is True\\n- To know what Jesus did for you\\n- To know how to be saved\\n\\nThen this link provides answers: https://tinyurl.com/y9el7ua4",0,0

-q47sHA4eAo,"238 Tsar Bombas per day equates to 0.0027546296 per second. What do you mean that they aren't powerful enough?\\nA Tsar Bomba releases 2.1*10^17 J in total where as a hurricane releases 6*10^14 J per second. Results from Wikipedia link below. The majority of the energy from the bomb will be released within a few seconds, this combined with the fact it is 3 powers of ten higher suggests that there is enough energy in just one of the bombs to cause an impact or at least suggest that energy is not the reason it wouldn't work. Simply saying that the energy release isn't high enough is false. For that to be true the energy release would need to take longer than 350 seconds although as I said the rate of energy release from the explosion would probably be much higher in the start and reduce in a non linear fashion.\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(energy)",0,0

3e9tJJKBlwM,"John, I love you, there is no tilde above the n in habanero. The reason is that Habanero literally means from Havana just as Jalapeño literally means from Jalapa. A lot of times in spanish when you have a person or thing originating from a location, you take off the last vowel and switch it with eño, like a person from Puerto Rico being called Puertorriqueño (also lets not forget they need our help). However, like most things in Spanish, there are many exceptions. When the last consonant of the location is an n, we don't add eño because saying Havaneño is really awkward to pronounce. Instead, ero is added (and the v becomes a b because they sound similar in Spanish). Please stop spreading this false pronunciation of habanero. It comes from a good place, in which people are trying to be respectful of Spanish culture and language, but instead they are just being wrong.",0,0

-otJ1LJGzcc,"This attack in Law Vegas was caused by someone using scopolamine on the attacker. Scopolamine is a powerful drug that once inhaled or ingested, removes free will from the victim; rendering them susceptible to suggestion. Someone blew the drug in his face, and told him to fire on those people. There is even a testimony from an eye witness that said two Spanish people made threats to the people at the venue 45 minutes prior to the shooting. I don't know if this drug was ever used in the previous shooting, but I do know that only law abiding citizens follow laws. There's a lot of talk about gun control or tougher regulations, but I think the only way to curb gun violence is to make gun ownership mandatory. You carry your identification around with you, why not a tiny pistol for your own defense? Robbery, rape, murder, and harassment would all go down if criminals even had the notion that 90% of citizens they preyed upon were armed. If you're a feminist, you definitely should support gun ownership. Men give us a lot more respect when they see a holster hanging from our bra line beneath our blouse. They stare at our tits anyway.

One automatic rifle CAN and DOES sound like multiple weapons being fired. \\nI can't claim to be certain of shit, and that's my point.

ScmJvmzDcG0,"I have to disagree with LWT on this one. If their fear is dangerous precedents, publicly attacking the most accurate methods we possess to identify criminals without offering an alternative sets a very dangerous one indeed. What's the alternative? eye-witness testimony? That's proven to be the LEAST accurate form of evidence possible.\\nI'm not some right wingnut; but part of me wants to let the far-left leaners open the prison doors, and legalize their drugs, just so I can hear what excuses they manufacture when they have no guns to defend themselves, and they and their families fall prey to all of the convicts that effective legal procedures have CORRECTLY put away.\\nDo the math. According to the statistics cited by this show, 0.003% of forensic science is flawed. If you've got something with a lower margin for error, I'm all ears. Until that time however, I'm afraid that we have to tolerate the rogue cases of individuals wrongly convicted by faulty evidence, and continue to strive to either eliminate that erroneous margin, or come up with something better.",0,0

I don't hate America but you see, shootings in America IS an issue and such attacks ARE terror attacks Because if you put yourself in the shoes of families whose people got shot were in a mass which WERE terrorized. If you see it from this perspective maybe, just maybe consider Gun control. Please America, we the people from developing countries idolize you in bringing your culture to us. If you take other developed countries like Australia for example, even they had a traumatizing  shooting after which they enforced better gun control laws and looking at the amount of shootings after that has certainly decreased.

O2pyRDQgVjk,"Basically, Hahn was a chemist, and so barium showing up, uninvited as it were, in the middle of his uranium preparation was a complete mystery.  Meitner was a nuclear physicist, and for her it was more a question of fitting the pieces together.  SciShow should have emphasized that she not only recognized that the barium indicated fission, but also determined that krypton was the other part (a noble gas, it would have been very difficult to find the way the barium was), and further determined the loss of weight in the nuclei from the original U-235 nucleus, and found that it accounted, through Einstein's formula, for the huge amount of kinetic energy released.  All done in her head, while on a skiing vacation over the Christmas holiday with her nephew when Hahn's communique arrived.\\n\\nAlso, she communicated the discovery to Nils Bohr who went to the US in early January to attend a physics conference, in which he passed the news on to all the physicists, native and alien, in America.  That including Ernest O. Lawrence, who carried it back to his lab in Berkeley, CA and reproduced the results there.  In this way the news spread much faster than the journals would have been able to do it.\\n\\nFinally, Enrico Fermi witnessed the same results 6 months before in his lab in Rome, but he mis-guessed about the what was happening. After describing his results incorrectly at a conference, he moved his family to America, and was present there to hear Bohr's news. He could have been the discoverer of fission.",0,0

O2pyRDQgVjk,"This video begins with an extremely unfortunate trope: accidental scientific discovery.  Scientific discoveries that can be reasonably called accidental are extremely rare.  Louis Pasteur wrote, Chance only favors the prepared mind.  Columbus, as an example, is commonly said to have accidentally blundered into the Americas.  Hogwash.  Columbus worked hard, over a considerable period, to assemble a voyage of discovery.  It was a perilous voyage, fraught with serious uncertainty and risk.  Had he not undertaken this perilous voyage, he could not have run into the Americas.  He could not, for example, have found the Americas by composing lute sonatas in Genoa.  Goodyear's discovery of vulcanization is similarly not at all accidental.  By his own account, he specifically set out to do experiments in an attempt to find a cure for the deficiencies of unvulcanized rubber.  His hot stove observation resulted from an early experiment involving heating rubber.  He continued a program of systematic experiments to develop a practical method of vulcanization.  There is also good reason to believe he benefited from the discoveries of others working on the same subject.\\n\\nIf the definition of accidental discovery is that it involves finding something one was not expecting, then that encompasses a very large fraction of all discoveries.  But, discoveries of any sort are highly unlikely to result from indolence.  Hahn, Meitner et al set out on a specific, difficult, detailed program of experiments to discover the effects of neutron irradiation of heavy elements.  Is it accidental that they found one of those effects?",0,1

N0lsMVNXZJY,"He was a gun runner framed by CIA/Mossad. They made a criminal into a bigger criminal and sacrificed him for their own version of a greater good. Many reported more than one shooter. He somehow got 20 guns into a hotel room by himself. Now they say he likely had help. No shit. His help killed him before the shooting started. 4chan post shows a warning weeks prior to this shooting saying something big is about to go down in Vegas and to stay away from crowded areas, saying he is leaking information from gov't operations. FBI knows this by know if anyone can look this up. But we should all know FBI, CIA, and Mossad are all at odds with each other. The leaker is definitely dead by now unless he's very, very good at what he does. Say I'm a moron or a crackpot, I really don't care. Look it up or shut the fuck up. Figure it out.",0,0

A lot of times in spanish when you have a person or thing originating from a location, you take off the last vowel and switch it with eño, like a person from Puerto Rico being called Puertorriqueño (also lets not forget they need our help). However, like most things in Spanish, there are many exceptions. When the last consonant of the location is an n, we don't add eño because saying Havaneño is really awkward to pronounce. Instead, ero is added (and the v becomes a b because they sound similar in Spanish). Please stop spreading this false pronunciation of habanero. It comes from a good place, in which people are trying to be respectful of Spanish culture and language, but instead they are just being wrong.",0,0

There will be no more pain or suffering. In fact, God Himself will wipe all tears from our eyes. \\n\\nSo please, if you don't know Jesus, call upon Him today. Repent of your sins and put your faith in Jesus Christ. He loves you, my friends. He is not angry at you, although the devil will have you to believe that He is. This is not true, because Jesus is waiting on you to call upon Him in Truth. \\n\\nHe is not a God who forces Himself on you, He is a God that respects your decision, but He has shown us that each decision we make has consequences. \\n\\nSo make the greatest decision of your life and make Jesus your Lord and Savior. You will be forgiven, you will be delivered, you will be set free. \\n\\nTrust in His Love. \\n\\nI pray you consider calling out to Jesus, because to die without The Lord is a very dangerous thing - there is a major consequence to it. \\n\\nShalom, friends.",1,4

vaAzCXxAoQE,"Dear Pittsburgh Dad,\\n\\nI'm English and I live in New Zealand.  I went on holiday to Pittsburgh in 1989 and even before then they were my favourite team.  At the time American Football was gaining popularity in the UK as a sport on Channel 4 but they only played highlights and the Super Bowl.  Most of my mates supported the Dolphins, the Dallas Cryboys or the Chicago Care Bears and I was the only one that supported the Steelers, despite their 88 season of 5-11.  Before I got to Pittsburgh, they'd lost to The Hated Cleve Brownies 51-0 and the Bungles 34-10 and the season looked bleak.  I was booked to see the Steelers at Cleveland and then at home against the KC Cheats.  We all know the outcome of those matches... If you're over thirty-five... and a bit obsessed...\\n\\nAnyway, we love what you're doing, and did I mention I once got to speak to Myron Cope on the phone?\\nGo Steelers!",0,0

-otJ1LJGzcc,"This attack in Law Vegas was caused by someone using scopolamine on the attacker. Scopolamine is a powerful drug that once inhaled or ingested, removes free will from the victim; rendering them susceptible to suggestion. Someone blew the drug in his face, and told him to fire on those people. There is even a testimony from an eye witness that said two Spanish people made threats to the people at the venue 45 minutes prior to the shooting. I don't know if this drug was ever used in the previous shooting, but I do know that only law abiding citizens follow laws. There's a lot of talk about gun control or tougher regulations, but I think the only way to curb gun violence is to make gun ownership mandatory. You carry your identification around with you, why not a tiny pistol for your own defense? Robbery, rape, murder, and harassment would all go down if criminals even had the notion that 90% of citizens they preyed upon were armed. If you're a feminist, you definitely should support gun ownership. Men give us a lot more respect when they see a holster hanging from our bra line beneath our blouse. They stare at our tits anyway.

ScmJvmzDcG0,"If you really want to see examples of this, look at the evidence that sometimes has convicted people of arson.  In the seventies, the government paid for studies of evidence of arson using controlled tests that compared evidence of a fire started accidentally to fires started with accelerants.  They found that at least seven signs of arson, signs presented to juries as proof of arson, were false.  \\n\\nFor example, they thought if glass had a bunch of small cracks it was evidence of quick heating; in fact, quick heating did not produce the cracks but quick cooling did.  So something that was caused by the fire department putting out the fire was considered evidence of arson.  \\n\\nEven after these lab tests established on the basis of real science the reliable evidence of arson, people were still being convicted in court based on the disproved signs used by so-called experts.  In some cases, judges refused to reverse convictions of arson even though the evidence presented that got the defendant convicted were among the signs proven to be bogus indicators of arson.

ScmJvmzDcG0,"Remember, television is FICTION, forensics is a genuine science, requiring years of training.  It is not Bones,NCIS or CSI.  The majority are certified forensic anthropologists or forensic pathologists..be sure the one you hire is certified!  The public is not trained in forensic technique or the sciences, particularly anatomy, chemistry, physics, or bioengineering.  Most juries tend to zone out when science is introduced into a court case.  Fortunately DNA can now be used to exonerate, not just implicate - this is good, and can correct mistakes of the past. The science and technologies in forensics have grown exponentially since 2000. I do not consider a criminologist or a coroner to be a forensic scientist.  Coroners are elected, they do not require extensive scientific training, to declare a person dead.  Criminologists don't hide out in morgues doing autopsies.  Forensic scientists DO. We can even tell where an individual is from, their diet and lifestyle --centuries after their death. Unfortunately, many forensic labs are understaffed and overwhelmed by backlogs, usually caused by legal and political clashes.  Politics do not belong in a morgue, sorry.  Like any other job,  a few narcissists pop up. They should be reprimanded and barred from practice.  It would also help if local politicians didn't slash funding for scientific research.  But....scientific research is commonly slashed of its government funding.  So are the arts.  Yet both have much in common and often blend - there is art in science, and science in art.

According to the statistics cited by this show, 0.003% of forensic science is flawed. If you've got something with a lower margin for error, I'm all ears.

O2pyRDQgVjk,"Basically, Hahn was a chemist, and so barium showing up, uninvited as it were, in the middle of his uranium preparation was a complete mystery.  Meitner was a nuclear physicist, and for her it was more a question of fitting the pieces together.  SciShow should have emphasized that she not only recognized that the barium indicated fission, but also determined that krypton was the other part (a noble gas, it would have been very difficult to find the way the barium was), and further determined the loss of weight in the nuclei from the original U-235 nucleus, and found that it accounted, through Einstein's formula, for the huge amount of kinetic energy released.  All done in her head, while on a skiing vacation over the Christmas holiday with her nephew when Hahn's communique arrived.\\n\\nAlso, she communicated the discovery to Nils Bohr who went to the US in early January to attend a physics conference, in which he passed the news on to all the physicists, native and alien, in America.  That including Ernest O. Lawrence, who carried it back to his lab in Berkeley, CA and reproduced the results there.  In this way the news spread much faster than the journals would have been able to do it.\\n\\nFinally, Enrico Fermi witnessed the same results 6 months before in his lab in Rome, but he mis-guessed about the what was happening. After describing his results incorrectly at a conference, he moved his family to America, and was present there to hear Bohr's news. He could have been the discoverer of fission.",0,0

O2pyRDQgVjk,"This video begins with an extremely unfortunate trope: accidental scientific discovery.  Scientific discoveries that can be reasonably called accidental are extremely rare.  Louis Pasteur wrote, Chance only favors the prepared mind.  Columbus, as an example, is commonly said to have accidentally blundered into the Americas.  Hogwash.  Columbus worked hard, over a considerable period, to assemble a voyage of discovery.  It was a perilous voyage, fraught with serious uncertainty and risk.  Had he not undertaken this perilous voyage, he could not have run into the Americas.  He could not, for example, have found the Americas by composing lute sonatas in Genoa.  Goodyear's discovery of vulcanization is similarly not at all accidental.  By his own account, he specifically set out to do experiments in an attempt to find a cure for the deficiencies of unvulcanized rubber.  His hot stove observation resulted from an early experiment involving heating rubber.  He continued a program of systematic experiments to develop a practical method of vulcanization.  There is also good reason to believe he benefited from the discoveries of others working on the same subject.\\n\\nIf the definition of accidental discovery is that it involves finding something one was not expecting, then that encompasses a very large fraction of all discoveries.  But, discoveries of any sort are highly unlikely to result from indolence.  Hahn, Meitner et al set out on a specific, difficult, detailed program of experiments to discover the effects of neutron irradiation of heavy elements.  Is it accidental that they found one of those effects?",0,1

Evidence is suggesting that Paddock was possibly a gun runner for an intelligence agency, which would explain all the guns and the other aforementioned oddities surrounding the shooting.

Paddock worked for a major aerospace company which had connections with Skunkworks(Area-51) – and he held multiple pilot licenses.\\n\\n3.There were over 20 firearms transported to Paddock’s room in a casino\\nwhich is under constant surveillance, even in the hotel rooms\\nthemselves. Notice how the mainstream media was so quick to claim\\nPaddock was a “lone operator” the morning after the shooting, despite\\nthis clear discrepancy.\\n\\n4.

The air strip he supposedly used was right next to the Hotel he was at. He gambled so free rain of unlimited cash while preparing. He was never violent, he had a girlfriend, he was wealthy,healthy, and well known around the places he went. Seems everyone liked him with out thinking about it. Maybe they got him when the girl friend left. Maybe they made her leave and she never knew so this wouldn't raise any suspicion while preparing For what was to come. He wore gloves. I bet they only find his prints and absolutely clean shell casings. Even the guns will only have his prints too and everything also it the room will be completely clean, except for his prints. If he did this it would be a first. Killers have done bad things before. He just didn't pull a gun out in the heat of the moment like lower scaled killers do when the shoot someone over BS. He planed this?, and carried it out with not a hint. Even the guy that brought up the room service didnt think anything wrong. He probably knew of him or knew him more well with how many times he gambles and gets rooms. I just cant wrap my head around him being the killer. What about the explosive materials he had that were never used in the car. They said he was gonna escape but i would like to realistically have you guys think about that. Yeah the higher up you are the better shot but, that would make your escape that much harder. And all the cameras on the way down wouldn't have helped. I think towards the end he was in the room waiting to die by the hand of the killers. I say killers because in this short of time it would have taken even professional murders to set up. This guy had no kids either just the girlfriend that was sent away. If he was abducted by killers, they would have to kill her to to keep quiet or just send her away so no one looks for her and foil the plans. The 100 thousand was probably to distract her when she got home so they didnt have to talk much. It could have easily have happened. He just doesn't set the picture as making him the killer. No one ever saw him shoot the guns, even the swat. Just a dead man on the gound when they went in. I think when they tried to breach they shot him in the head and somehow left out of there. Even if they told him to do it by himself that wouldn't make sense to me either because if it were me i would shoot myself before 100's of people without a further thought. Every killer has rubbed someone wrong at on time and all the witnesses that ever talked to him face to face never felt threatened. People just don't become maniacs the blink of an eye and live to you 60's then turn into a super evil person. Every bullet he supposedly fired, with even a semi sane person would have stopped a long time ago.

A lot of times in spanish when you have a person or thing originating from a location, you take off the last vowel and switch it with eño, like a person from Puerto Rico being called Puertorriqueño (also lets not forget they need our help). However, like most things in Spanish, there are many exceptions. When the last consonant of the location is an n, we don't add eño because saying Havaneño is really awkward to pronounce. Instead, ero is added (and the v becomes a b because they sound similar in Spanish). Please stop spreading this false pronunciation of habanero.

-otJ1LJGzcc,"This attack in Law Vegas was caused by someone using scopolamine on the attacker. Scopolamine is a powerful drug that once inhaled or ingested, removes free will from the victim; rendering them susceptible to suggestion. Someone blew the drug in his face, and told him to fire on those people. There is even a testimony from an eye witness that said two Spanish people made threats to the people at the venue 45 minutes prior to the shooting. I don't know if this drug was ever used in the previous shooting, but I do know that only law abiding citizens follow laws. There's a lot of talk about gun control or tougher regulations, but I think the only way to curb gun violence is to make gun ownership mandatory. You carry your identification around with you, why not a tiny pistol for your own defense? Robbery, rape, murder, and harassment would all go down if criminals even had the notion that 90% of citizens they preyed upon were armed. If you're a feminist, you definitely should support gun ownership. Men give us a lot more respect when they see a holster hanging from our bra line beneath our blouse. They stare at our tits anyway. Might as well give them a warning that we are armed and willing to defend ourselves.",0,0

One automatic rifle CAN and DOES sound like multiple weapons being fired. \\nI can't claim to be certain of shit, and that's my point.

This is the poster child of what you've described... it is constantly praised as iron clad evidence by every crime television show around... CSI, Law and Order, etc.\\n\\nBut that has been one of the most thoroughly debunked sciences. They've used the polygraph on *_plants_* and determined they had emotional responses. The inventor if the polygraph machine has denounced it... publicly stating it is unreliable.\\n\\nIt works by detecting changes in various physiological factors such as blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and skin conductivity. A person who is merely nervous can fail the test... questions that are asked may cause a reaction but not always because a lie is forthcoming... the question may be personal, emotional, confusing.. or any number of reasons we have physiological changes in our system. Furthermore there is no evidence that any pattern of physiological reactions is unique to deception.\\n\\nLastly... people can train themselves to beat the polygraph... so if you have a criminal that is skilled at beating a polygraph... they would be enthusiastic about being tested so they will have evidence in their favor. While the general public that believes all the television shows... may enthusiastically take the test to exonerate themselves... only to fail it because of those physiological changes they weren't controlling.\\n\\nAnd prosecutors have no room to complain about any CSI Effect... because it benefits them far more than it harms... they know full well that the jurors CSI perception... allows the prosecutors to sell their expert scientist to them hook, line, and sinker. It is that CSI Effect that dupes people into taking those polygraphs... and allows them to use the shoddy results and convince the jurors it is iron clad evidence... just as they do with bite marks and fingerprints, and hair analysis etc.",0,0

ScmJvmzDcG0,"If you really want to see examples of this, look at the evidence that sometimes has convicted people of arson.  In the seventies, the government paid for studies of evidence of arson using controlled tests that compared evidence of a fire started accidentally to fires started with accelerants.  They found that at least seven signs of arson, signs presented to juries as proof of arson, were false.  \\n\\nFor example, they thought if glass had a bunch of small cracks it was evidence of quick heating; in fact, quick heating did not produce the cracks but quick cooling did.  So something that was caused by the fire department putting out the fire was considered evidence of arson.  \\n\\nEven after these lab tests established on the basis of real science the reliable evidence of arson, people were still being convicted in court based on the disproved signs used by so-called experts.  In some cases, judges refused to reverse convictions of arson even though the evidence presented that got the defendant convicted were among the signs proven to be bogus indicators of arson.  So teach your kids science, before its too late.\\n\\nhttp://discovermagazine.com/2011/nov/24-seven-myths-about-arson",0,0

ScmJvmzDcG0,"Remember, television is FICTION, forensics is a genuine science, requiring years of training.  It is not Bones,NCIS or CSI.  The majority are certified forensic anthropologists or forensic pathologists..be sure the one you hire is certified!  The public is not trained in forensic technique or the sciences, particularly anatomy, chemistry, physics, or bioengineering.  Most juries tend to zone out when science is introduced into a court case.  Fortunately DNA can now be used to exonerate, not just implicate - this is good, and can correct mistakes of the past. The science and technologies in forensics have grown exponentially since 2000. I do not consider a criminologist or a coroner to be a forensic scientist.  Coroners are elected, they do not require extensive scientific training, to declare a person dead.  Criminologists don't hide out in morgues doing autopsies.  Forensic scientists DO. We can even tell where an individual is from, their diet and lifestyle --centuries after their death. Unfortunately, many forensic labs are understaffed and overwhelmed by backlogs, usually caused by legal and political clashes.  Politics do not belong in a morgue, sorry.  Like any other job,  a few narcissists pop up. They should be reprimanded and barred from practice.  It would also help if local politicians didn't slash funding for scientific research.  But....scientific research is commonly slashed of its government funding.  So are the arts.  Yet both have much in common and often blend - there is art in science, and science in art.   Think of the mathematics involved in something like the Sistine Chapel, or any cathedral.

According to the statistics cited by this show, 0.003% of forensic science is flawed. If you've got something with a lower margin for error, I'm all ears.

N0lsMVNXZJY,Deep State and Bob Mueller weren't considering everyones cellphone footage and recordings when they planned this and this is because of Plan A..\n.Plan A...they shot at fuel tanks first .\nthat was plan A..they intended to incinerate everyone and to make thier escape in confusion..when that failed Plan B went into play....\nPlan B  it was to open up with full auto mini mac gun..multiple shooters for sure .. dont you dare believe otherwise .\n... They wont get away with this like the did on 9/11,1,0

N0lsMVNXZJY,Dont take this theory to serious but what if..Maybe he was severely deppressed and obviosly mentally disturbed. Could it be possible his gambling addiction caused him a tremendous burden? One he could not overcome? He probably planned his suicide for that day cause he knew the festival would be an open area with thousands of ppl that could easily be killed from his room. Maybe  he wanted to go out with a bang so to speak. This is not unheard of. Many ppl have went on killing sprees taking other lives with them before killing themselves. You hear it all the time! Unhappy father/ husband in dept kills entire family before killing himself. This massacre could be as simple as that. However it appears their were more shooters involved so..perhaps he asked for help to carry out the biggest mass murder in the U.S. history. He wanted to be remembered  as a legend of sorts.  perhaps like those of Charlie Manson and Ted Bundy and the like. Who really knows!!  The FBI is just making this case more difficult by hiding the hotel camera evidence and other pieces of evidence from his room.  He did behave as tho he planned on committing suicide by deleting his social media accounts before the shooting and wiring the money to his girlfriend..whom i think has it hidden. He offered to buy her family a house according to other sources. so perhaps he sent his girl back home incase the law caught him before he could kill himself. He obviosly loved her very much and didnt want her to get hurt in the process. Idk..but theirs possibilities that this man wanted to die but not until he killed alot of ppl first. Maybe he was angry at the casinos for causing his gambling addiction which he obviosly was a slave to. Its not that far fetched.,0,0

Plus if it were true that the guns were legal, the man was still found with enough explosives to kill everyone in that area(thank god he didnt).

No one comes to the Father except through Me.”  NKJV\\n\\nActs 4:12 states; Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name [Jesus] under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.  NKJV\\n\\nJesus said in John 3:16-17; For God so greatly loved and dearly prized the world (YOU) that He even gave His One and only begotten Son, so that whoever believes and trusts in Him as Savior shall not perish, but have eternal life.  For God did not send the Son into the world to judge and condemn the world, that is, to initiate the final judgment of the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.  AMP\\n\\nJesus said in John 3:3; I assure you and most solemnly say to you, unless a person is Born Again, reborn from above, spiritually transformed, renewed, sanctified, he cannot ever see and experience the kingdom of God.  AMP\\n\\nRomans 10:9-11 states; that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. 10 For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. 11 For the Scripture says, “Whoever believes on Him will not be put to shame.  NKJV\\n\\nRomans 10:13 states; For “whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.”  NKJV\\n\\n1 Corinthians 15:1-5 states; Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, 2 by which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you—unless you believed in vain.  3 For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ Died for our sins according to the Scriptures, 4 and that He was Buried, and that He Rose Again the third day according to the Scriptures, 5 and that He was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve.  NKJV\\n\\nAnd REPENT...\\n\\nActs 17:30 Therefore God overlooked and disregarded the former ages of ignorance; but now He commands all people everywhere to REPENT [that is, to change their old way of thinking, to regret their past sins, and to seek God’s purpose for their lives].  AMP\\n\\nJesus said in Mark 1:15 “The [appointed period of] time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; REPENT [change your inner self—your old way of thinking, regret past sins, live your life in a way that proves REPENTANCE; seek God’s purpose for your life] and believe [with a deep, abiding trust] in the good news [regarding salvation].”  AMP\\n\\n1 John 3:10 In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.  NKJV\\n\\nFrom what I have read we know how 8 of Jesus' disciples died and all 8 of those 8 chose death rather than to simply state that Jesus had not actually rose from the dead, that they were just lying, we made it all up.  Think about that!  Would you ever choose to be murdered to maintain a complete LIE?  No you would not.  You would say “ok, ok, it was a lie”.  They would not deny their Lord to keep this life because they knew they have eternal life in Jesus because they saw Him raised from the dead.\\n\\nPlease get in a quiet and alone place SOON and pray to Jesus that He show you somehow if these things above are true.  If you are sincere, He will answer you…\\n\\nAnd don’t ever forget just as there is a GOD that made the Heavens and the Earth there is also a devil, a Satan that hates God and everything God as ever made and that means he Hates YOU and wants to deceive and trick you into believing ANYTHING except Jesus and His salvation through the cross.

N0lsMVNXZJY,"Stop investigating. What's done is done. He's dead, he killed people. If people don't like these concert shootings than they shouldn't go to concerts. They basically killed themselves.

FqdsYn9TdWQ,The new blaster isn't functionally credible - there's no place for the bullets and no apparent way to load them. The inability to fire blanks means they have to resort to a CGI cop out - this new blaster is a total fail! I don't blame the person who made it - I blame the director for allowing him to get away with it. Which means the director may not really understand what made the original film (and blaster) great. I smell a flop. Shame on Ridley for not directing it himself.,0,0

3e9tJJKBlwM,"John, I love you, there is no tilde above the n in habanero. The reason is that Habanero literally means from Havana just as Jalapeño literally means from Jalapa. A lot of times in spanish when you have a person or thing originating from a location, you take off the last vowel and switch it with eño, like a person from Puerto Rico being called Puertorriqueño (also lets not forget they need our help). However, like most things in Spanish, there are many exceptions. When the last consonant of the location is an n, we don't add eño because saying Havaneño is really awkward to pronounce. Instead, ero is added (and the v becomes a b because they sound similar in Spanish). Please stop spreading this false pronunciation of habanero. It comes from a good place, in which people are trying to be respectful of Spanish culture and language, but instead they are just being wrong.",0,0

vaAzCXxAoQE,"Dear Pittsburgh Dad,\\n\\nI'm English and I live in New Zealand.  I went on holiday to Pittsburgh in 1989 and even before then they were my favourite team.  At the time American Football was gaining popularity in the UK as a sport on Channel 4 but they only played highlights and the Super Bowl.  Most of my mates supported the Dolphins, the Dallas Cryboys or the Chicago Care Bears and I was the only one that supported the Steelers, despite their 88 season of 5-11.  Before I got to Pittsburgh, they'd lost to The Hated Cleve Brownies 51-0 and the Bungles 34-10 and the season looked bleak.  I was booked to see the Steelers at Cleveland and then at home against the KC Cheats.  We all know the outcome of those matches...

Plus if it were true that the guns were legal, the man was still found with enough explosives to kill everyone in that area(thank god he didnt).

N0lsMVNXZJY,Dont take this theory to serious but what if..Maybe he was severely deppressed and obviosly mentally disturbed. Could it be possible his gambling addiction caused him a tremendous burden? One he could not overcome? He probably planned his suicide for that day cause he knew the festival would be an open area with thousands of ppl that could easily be killed from his room. Maybe  he wanted to go out with a bang so to speak. This is not unheard of. Many ppl have went on killing sprees taking other lives with them before killing themselves. You hear it all the time! Unhappy father/ husband in dept kills entire family before killing himself. This massacre could be as simple as that. However it appears their were more shooters involved so..perhaps he asked for help to carry out the biggest mass murder in the U.S. history. He wanted to be remembered  as a legend of sorts.  perhaps like those of Charlie Manson and Ted Bundy and the like. Who really knows!!  The FBI is just making this case more difficult by hiding the hotel camera evidence and other pieces of evidence from his room.  He did behave as tho he planned on committing suicide by deleting his social media accounts before the shooting and wiring the money to his girlfriend..whom i think has it hidden. He offered to buy her family a house according to other sources. so perhaps he sent his girl back home incase the law caught him before he could kill himself. He obviosly loved her very much and didnt want her to get hurt in the process. Idk..but theirs possibilities that this man wanted to die but not until he killed alot of ppl first. Maybe he was angry at the casinos for causing his gambling addiction which he obviosly was a slave to. Its not that far fetched.,0,0

A lot of times in spanish when you have a person or thing originating from a location, you take off the last vowel and switch it with eño, like a person from Puerto Rico being called Puertorriqueño (also lets not forget they need our help). However, like most things in Spanish, there are many exceptions. When the last consonant of the location is an n, we don't add eño because saying Havaneño is really awkward to pronounce. Instead, ero is added (and the v becomes a b because they sound similar in Spanish). Please stop spreading this false pronunciation of habanero. It comes from a good place, in which people are trying to be respectful of Spanish culture and language, but instead they are just being wrong.",2,0

His father wanted to start a church in Vegas due to his love for gambling and to fund that gambling.  \\nPaddock liked to stay in hotel rooms and read the bible.  The hotel rooms he rented/compt were the messages.  \\nFloor 32 room 125 is Exodus 32 verse 25.  That is where Moses kills 3,000 of his own people for partying and having a good time.  \\n\\n25 And when Moses saw that the people had broken loose (for Aaron had let them break loose, to the derision of their enemies), \\n26 then Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said, “Who is on the Lord's side? Come to me.” And all the sons of Levi gathered around him. \\n27 And he said to them, “Thus says the Lord God of Israel, ‘Put your sword on your side each of you, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and each of you kill his brother and his companion and his neighbor.’” \\n28 And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses.

N0lsMVNXZJY,Dont take this theory to serious but what if..Maybe he was severely deppressed and obviosly mentally disturbed. Could it be possible his gambling addiction caused him a tremendous burden? One he could not overcome? He probably planned his suicide for that day cause he knew the festival would be an open area with thousands of ppl that could easily be killed from his room. Maybe  he wanted to go out with a bang so to speak. This is not unheard of. Many ppl have went on killing sprees taking other lives with them before killing themselves. You hear it all the time! Unhappy father/ husband in dept kills entire family before killing himself. This massacre could be as simple as that. However it appears their were more shooters involved so..perhaps he asked for help to carry out the biggest mass murder in the U.S. history. He wanted to be remembered  as a legend of sorts.  perhaps like those of Charlie Manson and Ted Bundy and the like. Who really knows!!  The FBI is just making this case more difficult by hiding the hotel camera evidence and other pieces of evidence from his room.  He did behave as tho he planned on committing suicide by deleting his social media accounts before the shooting and wiring the money to his girlfriend..whom i think has it hidden. He offered to buy her family a house according to other sources. so perhaps he sent his girl back home incase the law caught him before he could kill himself. He obviosly loved her very much and didnt want her to get hurt in the process. Idk..but theirs possibilities that this man wanted to die but not until he killed alot of ppl first. Maybe he was angry at the casinos for causing his gambling addiction which he obviosly was a slave to. Its not that far fetched.,0,0

FqdsYn9TdWQ,Doug should have given credit to Tomenosuke & Adam knows better. They may have made one Hero from scratch but most of those blasters are a kit from Tomenosuke; not fabricated by hand from scratch like he is claiming.\n\nThat is why Adam is not raving over the classic blasters and is fascinated by the rubber one and the new versions.  It's because he knows what they are and has several.,2,1

tv19Sd9dS38,"No-one believes that I have social anxiety apart from my best friend, they think I'm just awkward because I'm a teen, sure my social anxiety might only last throughout my teenage years but it's still social anxiety no matter what. When I get panic attacks most of my friends dismiss it as just being upset and having a small meltdown. \\nIt's because I always seem happy and not awkward. My sister is a lot more shy than me, I'm the louder and more confident sibling, when really the only reason i put on a confident front is so I don't seem weird to other people. I'm probably not making sense but just because I don't seem like I have social anxiety doesn't mean I don't have it. I wish people would understand that and not take me for a drama queen when I start crying for small reasons.",4,0
tv19Sd9dS38,"I've struggled with mental health problems pretty much my entire life. Panic attacks, eating disorders, severe mood swings, dysphoria... They put me on Prozac when i was 13. It didn't help. When I was about 16, i started to suspect i might be bipolar. My symptoms matched a lot better with Bipolar Disorder than they did with Major Depressive Disorder, my diagnosis at the time. When i brought it up with my psychiatrist, she completely blew me off. She made me feel stupid for even thinking it. I figured, she's the professional, if she says i don't have it, then i don't have it. I continued with the antidepressants. I continued feeling agitated and out of control. I continued feeling completely insane. Then when i was 21, I was diagnosed with type 2 bipolar disorder. I'm on a mood stabilizer now, which helps a lot. I wish my doctor had listened to me back in high school. I still struggle sometimes, but now I'm on the right treatment plan.

tv19Sd9dS38,"Time to throw my story Into the ring.\\nSo for years I tried to tell people, friends, family and professionals alike, that there was something wrong with me because I was slowly losing the ability to handle life. I hated everything, I found no joy in things I used to. And most importantly I hated myself. No one tried to actually help me until I attempted to commit suicide this past summer. Now suddenly some people care. I was so pissed off when my mom and aunt told me that I should have told them how much pain it was in. I am getting a bit of help now but there are people who still don't believe me like my dad. I tried to explain to him that I'm not ready to go back to work yet but he just tells me that I am physically able to work so I should be fine.",1,0

I'm worried that I might not actually have something and that I'm making it up or that I may just be blowing things out of proportion.

tv19Sd9dS38,"It honestly baffles me that people still dont beleive in mental illness... like do they think millions of people are just making it up or...? OCD controls every aspect of my life, Im constantly in a state of high anxiety, and anything can set me off into an overwhelmed mess. No normal person would be so overwhelmed by the number of steps they take, the place they sit, the number of times they lock and unlock and lock again the room door and the house door and the car door, the exact time waking up, exact time eating, exact time leaving, exact time arriving. The world overwhelms me in itself and I know Im not the only person who feels that way. Its important that when someone is ignorant like this, we educate them, because sometimes they just dont understand what the symptoms of different mental disorders can be, and how debilitating they often are. However if someone is presistantly being a negitive voice in your life and making you feel invalid, its perfectly okay to distance yourself from them, because its most important to be healthy. It just frustrates me so much to see people set aside mental ilness as not being a big deal, when its a real problem that keeps so many people from having a high quallity of life and even functioning on a basic level.",0,0
tv19Sd9dS38,"At 9 years old I was playing baseball with my pee-wee team and blacked out visually and could not move.  I could hear shouting to go back a base but I could not move.  This was the scariest thing of my life;  to realize that some thing is wrong and not able to do any thing.  Once I could actually move I went to my mom and told her I couldn't move or see.   She calmed me down and the rest of the day was normal. That normal helped me later when I was taken to a doctor who asked my parents if any thing had happened like this before.  They had said that there were some times were it seemed like I was not eating enough  and causing black outs, they wanted tests done to be sure.  The first tests were inconclusive but pointing to some thing wrong so I was sent to a children's hospital were tests proved that what ever happened at the ball game was happening in my sleep.  My brain was rebooting, it was stopping at least some of it's functions if not ALL of them.  There were times in the test that I was not even breathing.  My parents were told that it is called petit mal seizures or absence seizures. As luck would have these seizures could be out grown and talks with my grandmother on my mother's side pointed towards that.

The hotel rooms he rented/compt were the messages.  \\nFloor 32 room 125 is Exodus 32 verse 25.

Come to me.” And all the sons of Levi gathered around him. \\n27 And he said to them, “Thus says the Lord God of Israel, ‘Put your sword on your side each of you, and go to and fro from gate to gate throughout the camp, and each of you kill his brother and his companion and his neighbor.’” \\n28 And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses.

He either didn't do it and it was somebody else who had connections to the hotel (hence there being no footage) or he was with somebody else but was betrayed. \\n\\nEither way, he wasn't working alone and until I see CCTV evidence that he was in that room shooting or carrying bags up there, then I refuse to believe he did anything at all.\\n\\nDead men don't tend to talk very much.",0,0

The first tests were inconclusive but pointing to some thing wrong so I was sent to a children's hospital were tests proved that what ever happened at the ball game was happening in my sleep.

(Plus anxiety disorder, depression and Borderline Personality Disorder) It was really hard to get diagnosed because the PMDD would exacerbate my anxiety and depression to extreme levels. I actually went to the psych ward once because I was so depressed I was afraid I'd hurt myself. That's where I got diagnosed. My psychiatrist at the time didn't believe the hospital's diagnosis, and said he'd drop me  if I sought treatment for it (also he didn't want me to go back to school, despite the hospital telling him it was fine) So I said goodbye to him and found someone new. Also, I just wanted to point out that PMDD is a physical illness as much as a mental one, and while it can be treated with psych meds, it can also be treated with certain birth control pills. That's what I take, and I personally think it's easier and more effective, especially if you're already on a lot of meds, like me, since you don't have to screw around with the dosage or worry about drug interactions.",0,0

Every action or thought was turned into something vile. My depression then turned into starving myself but since I had an underlining condition I didn't lose weight I actually gained, which didn't help. So I started thinking about death. I would convince myself that most of my friends and family would get over me in a day or week. I still have relapses still to this day. I would say I'm happy all around but I just know I need a therapist but I can't afford one and I still feel selfish to even ask for one.

r8jWAvF3rcE,"Ehhh only modestly misleading this time I guess... and you didnt bother mentioning pikachurin when you brought up sonic hedgehog.. tsk tsk - also these two in particular sparked conversation about naming convention lol\\n\\nMost notably cancer is really freakin cool - like really. No one thing 'causes' cancer - cancer requires a number of things to go wrong, and continue to go wrong, to actually be worth noting. Merely having a cell recieving constant proliferation signals, is not enough to make a cell cancerous - there's a bunch o checks in place, and the cell may well just apoptose and that's that. If it does manage to have a compromised check system so that it can proliferate uncontrollably, there's still additional anti-proliferation checks - even if it's being told to replicate constantly (and I'll ignore immediate physical cell to cell stops or kill signals) it's movements will still be limited by stop signals at tissue boundary extracellular matrix. The cells may only proliferate in that tiny boxed in area... but wait the cells need a particularly regulated environment to survive... but that doesn't just magically happen there needs to be at minimum a blood supply, and if you start growing uncontrollably, only some of the outer layer of cells have a chance. So more goes wrong and one of the cells develops vascular promoting signals and hey you've got veins and stuff growing in to keep everything alive.... but it still can't go nowhere, it's just a very dense bit o cells.. up to this point, the tumor could be removed safely in its entirety.... but obviously we know cancers go horribly wrong... sooo what happens if it starts ignoring those 'no movement' signals.. well it starts moving away from the area and there's still a ton of things that can stop it at this point, maybe the immune system mounts a response, kills the escaping cells and even goes on to kill the entire cancer itself now that it's noticed it... and I've just realized my knowledge on this is super rusty and im very tired - can't remember half the protein names im thinking of and that makes things awkward lol... go read a cell bio book, cancer is cool as hell - only gene therapy or genetically modified humans is currently expected be a viable cure for cancer in general, though many types of cancers are using the easiest possible path to become malignant (what we call cancer that is able to spread (especially via blood) and stay alive - as per what I was describing above... that's many checkpoints passed)... and we've come up with some brilliant ways to murder them, usually with monoclonal antibodies (if you see any commercial for a drug that ends with '-mab', that's what it is)\\n\\n...annnnnd im gonna get some sleep.",0,0

Everyone should know this but, since the blade is sharp and far thinner on the edge than the pellet (0.177 of an inch) along with the force the air pistol puts on the back of the pellet causes it to split.\\n\\n2. The pellet that was used was made of lead, the majority of pellets are. While being a lot heavier, it is also much softer than steel, which is what the blade is made out of. This difference is what makes the cut so clean and like butter, which you can see in 28,500fps. The lead on steel is also why the cut edge that Dan shows is so smooth and perfect, along with the great made knife by SOG! Which, by the way, is said like hog but with an 'S'.\\n\\nThanks for the video guys, nice to see the split in action!\\n\\nNOTE: The reason real bullets fired out of a firearm also split is because bullets are made of lead as well. A lot of them have a copper lining on them, which is also softer than steel.",1,0

r8jWAvF3rcE,"Ehhh only modestly misleading this time I guess... and you didnt bother mentioning pikachurin when you brought up sonic hedgehog.. tsk tsk - also these two in particular sparked conversation about naming convention lol\\n\\nMost notably cancer is really freakin cool - like really. No one thing 'causes' cancer - cancer requires a number of things to go wrong, and continue to go wrong, to actually be worth noting. Merely having a cell recieving constant proliferation signals, is not enough to make a cell cancerous - there's a bunch o checks in place, and the cell may well just apoptose and that's that. If it does manage to have a compromised check system so that it can proliferate uncontrollably, there's still additional anti-proliferation checks - even if it's being told to replicate constantly (and I'll ignore immediate physical cell to cell stops or kill signals) it's movements will still be limited by stop signals at tissue boundary extracellular matrix. The cells may only proliferate in that tiny boxed in area... but wait the cells need a particularly regulated environment to survive... but that doesn't just magically happen there needs to be at minimum a blood supply, and if you start growing uncontrollably, only some of the outer layer of cells have a chance. So more goes wrong and one of the cells develops vascular promoting signals and hey you've got veins and stuff growing in to keep everything alive.... but it still can't go nowhere, it's just a very dense bit o cells.. up to this point, the tumor could be removed safely in its entirety.... but obviously we know cancers go horribly wrong... sooo what happens if it starts ignoring those 'no movement' signals.. well it starts moving away from the area and there's still a ton of things that can stop it at this point, maybe the immune system mounts a response, kills the escaping cells and even goes on to kill the entire cancer itself now that it's noticed it... and I've just realized my knowledge on this is super rusty and im very tired - can't remember half the protein names im thinking of and that makes things awkward lol... go read a cell bio book, cancer is cool as hell - only gene therapy or genetically modified humans is currently expected be a viable cure for cancer in general, though many types of cancers are using the easiest possible path to become malignant (what we call cancer that is able to spread (especially via blood) and stay alive - as per what I was describing above... that's many checkpoints passed)... and we've come up with some brilliant ways to murder them, usually with monoclonal antibodies (if you see any commercial for a drug that ends with '-mab', that's what it is)\\n\\n...annnnnd im gonna get some sleep.",0,0

I had no clue at the time what the scene was about until I saw it again at a friends house here over the weekend. Jeezo, we spoke about it and prayed that we are still just guessing at its meaning, but the scene now seems creepy second time around ....",1,1

KCNvREKTnQc,"Why do people applaud this? It was common knowledge for people in Hollywood to know Harvey was a beast, everyone knew. Seth isn't calling Harvey out hes making fun of what Harvey does to woman. Does Seth look serious? No. He told a sick joke and expected everyone to laughed at it like they did. Everyone in the room knows about Harvey and they still laughed including Seth smh. Seth never reported Harvey to the authorities so i wouldn't say he called him out.",0,1

_95NxbsbMF4,as much as it seemed to have hurt him what got me was the genuine hurt that you can see from her when she talks about loosing her best friend it can be  hard to watch.  how she wanted to really have him back as a friend and did not want him to just use it for  a video and did not want to get excited about getting him back just to loose him again. very genuine stuff,0,0

_95NxbsbMF4,"I actually feel like she purposely led him into believing that she likes him lol don't get all angry but maybe she did see him as friend but she liked the attention that he gives her so she friend zoned him. I totally believe Shane when he says she was giving him signals because she probably did so she would have him all over her, she liked that feeling. I am so convinced it's this and ofc she's gonna deny it all, everyone would hate her.",0,0

I just really wanna talk to her about what happened and what I did cuz I guess I made her feel some type of way but it seems she just doesn't wanna talk at all which really makes me mad and also sad. Like I'm willing to actually sit down in person and have both of us confront each other face to face but I guess that just won't happen. Just hopefully I'll get over her soon....,0,0

S0G5EloK3LE,"Hey guys! I wanted to let you know that using some wooden sticks could potentially hurt you if you fell over, etc. I honestly didn't even think about that aspect of the makeup application until it was pointed out to me! Use a flexible small bendable piece to use for the pins instead of the wooden sticks like I did! So so sorry guys! I want you to always be safe!

I thought that reputation album is gonna be album, where she'll sing about revenge, rap and some cool beats, like LWYMMD or Ready for it had. LWYMMD is tge best sing so far from her upcomming album and if the other songs will have similiar lyrics about love, like Ready for it or Gorgeous has, I'll be still buying this just because I'm her fan and I wanna hear the whole album, but I won't be excited.

She seems really sweet and I'm glad back then she was honest about her feelings with him back then even though he was hurt, some people will lie or stretch the truth cause they don't want to hurt someone's feelings but it's better to just be honest.

Im really happy that she was very cool with this and was open about her being a bit naive to his feelings. sometimes a lot of girls do that and dont even realize and guys who are a bit insecure can take it as them liking them back. either way this was a good video about them getting closure and im really happy for them \n:)),0,0

S0G5EloK3LE,"Hey guys! I wanted to let you know that using some wooden sticks could potentially hurt you if you fell over, etc. I honestly didn't even think about that aspect of the makeup application until it was pointed out to me! Use a flexible small bendable piece to use for the pins instead of the wooden sticks like I did! So so sorry guys! I want you to always be safe!

Ummmm if she did tht, then tht would of been leading him on. And also to the ppl saying it's disrespectful to Ryland yall are fools him and shane are in love. And both a very confident in their relationship and support each other. I can bet shane talked to him about this before even doing it. And if he expressed it would hurt him shane wouldn't of done it. Like for real on her channel her shane and Ryland all hang out! And they seem like they all get along. If Ryland is OK with shane being friends with his ex why would he have a problem with this.

There have been 4 others killed in hostile combat so far this year. Did Trump not call any of their families?\\n2. More than likely, Trump did not precede the phrase He knew what he was getting into with He was doing exactly what he wanted to do. which definitely softens the He knew what he was getting into phrase. Guessing Trump just blurted out He knew what he was getting into, which would be hurtful to hear without a preceding softening phrase.\\n3. What does a congresswoman listening to the call have to do with anything and why does it stun Kelly? Was Kelly stunned because someone who is unafraid of Trump was able to hear how Trump has zero empathy for anyone?\\n4. If Kelly wants to keep the loss of life sacred, how about coaching Trump to do a better job on these kinds of calls, including knowing the person's name? That would go a long way to keeping it sacred.\\n5.

Du2iFOoTaE0,"Religion does not deserve great respect. It deserves ridicule. The right for one to believe ridiculous things deserves great veneration. I’m sure what he meant to say is that his version of religion or religions he agrees with deserve respect. No wonder it’s a known fact that you can’t be an out of the closet atheist while in the army. Women aren’t “sacred” either. They are equals and should be treated with the utmost respect like all other human beings. Saying women are sacred means fawning over them and putting them on a pedestal. My gf doesn’t want me to hold the door for her, organize her banking or mow the lawn. I don’t do all the “man’s work” we do it together. I don’t respect her because she’s a woman, I respect her because she’s a great human being. I guarantee that this guy does not support women in the military. A trans gender person would blow his mind hahaha. Things are “sacred” are things that can’t be touched or critiqued. Things that aren’t up for negotiation or debate. Nothing should be sacred. Is marriage between a man and a woman sacred in his eyes? Probably. The crappy part is that wackos on the left have made truly debating things like employment equity impossible. Things can’t be sacred. One of the CNN meat heads said we need “civil discourse”. NO. If you tell me the world is flat I’m not going to be polite. I’m going to call you an idiot. If you tell me climate change is a hoax I will not be polite. But now I’m labelled as being on “the left”. Well I think BLM is going about things poorly, HRC was a soooooper liar and I’m unsure about employment equity and really have doubts about this wage gap thing (seems to be mounting evidence on both sides). But the left has made these sacred. Facts are sacred but facts are often difficult to come by. Trump has lied so much and has shown such little empathy that attempting this grand phone call was no doubt over his head. On the flip side if my father who was in the army, died and had his body brought back and then some politician showed up with a fucking bedazzled cowboy hat CLEARLY using situation as an opportunity, I would have rolled up that cowboy hat and smoked those rocks all the way back to Miami.",0,0

I wanted to let you know that using some wooden sticks could potentially hurt you if you fell over, etc. I honestly didn't even think about that aspect of the makeup application until it was pointed out to me! Use a flexible small bendable piece to use for the pins instead of the wooden sticks like I did! So so sorry guys! I want you to always be safe!

S0G5EloK3LE,"Very cool. I honestly can’t tell if I just didn’t necessarily like how u did the raised areas around the pins like little hills or if it’s because pinhead is just such a classic character that I am so used to seeing him with his classic makeup and pins how they normally look, that maybe I am just not used to seeing it any other way. But regardless, either way it is, I still like the look a lot. I just wouldn’t call it the classic pinheaded look, it’s just a little different take on it. But I especially loved that chatterer, that was insane! Perfect collab. For the pins, I don’t really know anything honestly. but maybe instead of wrapping the tape around the nails, just puncture the nail through the tape so it can lay flat. Or maybe if u had a cast or form or w.e of ur head and just put a bald cap on it or just have a friend help do it on ur head but then maybe they could have just all been stuck on to the bald cap with sprit gum or like liquid latex and flour so u had a thick consistency and could have just put that all over the head and the pins could just stick right into it or maybe even some cotton balls and Latex or w.e.?

_95NxbsbMF4,"i was in a somewhat similar situation about three weeks ago. i dropped out of school about 2-3 years ago (grade 12) because i've been depressed since about 2010. and i have been in no contact with anyone what so ever. till i found out someone i went to school with for about 10 years committed suicide.. i went to the funeral service. saw so many people from my classes... i got so many hugs that day. i never got that while in school. i hated the fact it was on those terms that i was seeing everyone. but everyone was together again. most were surprised to see me haha. i've been emotionally messed up since. especially because the same night/next day early morning (2 am) my boyfriend attempted suicide while drunk. luckily he lives here with us so i can keep an eye on him. but as im sitting here, i feel this numbness. i keep re imagining that night and i don't know if its pain im feeling.. but its something.",0,0

More than likely, Trump did not precede the phrase He knew what he was getting into with He was doing exactly what he wanted to do. which definitely softens the He knew what he was getting into phrase. Guessing Trump just blurted out He knew what he was getting into, which would be hurtful to hear without a preceding softening phrase.\\n3. What does a congresswoman listening to the call have to do with anything and why does it stun Kelly? Was Kelly stunned because someone who is unafraid of Trump was able to hear how Trump has zero empathy for anyone?\\n4. If Kelly wants to keep the loss of life sacred, how about coaching Trump to do a better job on these kinds of calls, including knowing the person's name? That would go a long way to keeping it sacred.\\n5. If Kelly wants Gold Star families to be sacred, why were the words of the Gold Star family Kahn attacked by Trump? Has Kelly ever criticized Trump for that attack?\\n6. How is calling a sitting Representative an empty barrel helping the situation? It's just a thoroughly divisive comment which he learned from Trump.\\n7. It's now been proven based on recordings of Representative Wilson's speech that Kelly lied about what she said in the speech. Kelly should issue an apology to Representative Wilson.\\n8.

Du2iFOoTaE0,"Religion does not deserve great respect. It deserves ridicule. The right for one to believe ridiculous things deserves great veneration. I’m sure what he meant to say is that his version of religion or religions he agrees with deserve respect. No wonder it’s a known fact that you can’t be an out of the closet atheist while in the army. Women aren’t “sacred” either. They are equals and should be treated with the utmost respect like all other human beings. Saying women are sacred means fawning over them and putting them on a pedestal. My gf doesn’t want me to hold the door for her, organize her banking or mow the lawn. I don’t do all the “man’s work” we do it together. I don’t respect her because she’s a woman, I respect her because she’s a great human being. I guarantee that this guy does not support women in the military. A trans gender person would blow his mind hahaha. Things are “sacred” are things that can’t be touched or critiqued. Things that aren’t up for negotiation or debate. Nothing should be sacred. Is marriage between a man and a woman sacred in his eyes? Probably. The crappy part is that wackos on the left have made truly debating things like employment equity impossible. Things can’t be sacred. One of the CNN meat heads said we need “civil discourse”. NO. If you tell me the world is flat I’m not going to be polite. I’m going to call you an idiot. If you tell me climate change is a hoax I will not be polite. But now I’m labelled as being on “the left”. Well I think BLM is going about things poorly, HRC was a soooooper liar and I’m unsure about employment equity and really have doubts about this wage gap thing (seems to be mounting evidence on both sides). But the left has made these sacred. Facts are sacred but facts are often difficult to come by. Trump has lied so much and has shown such little empathy that attempting this grand phone call was no doubt over his head.

S0G5EloK3LE,"Hey guys! I wanted to let you know that using some wooden sticks could potentially hurt you if you fell over, etc. I honestly didn't even think about that aspect of the makeup application until it was pointed out to me! Use a flexible small bendable piece to use for the pins instead of the wooden sticks like I did! So so sorry guys! I want you to always be safe! Courtney Little MUA recently did the MOST amazing job creating a full Pinhead look, so for an idea of what to properly use for pins, check her video! <3",338,10

S0G5EloK3LE,"Very cool. I honestly can’t tell if I just didn’t necessarily like how u did the raised areas around the pins like little hills or if it’s because pinhead is just such a classic character that I am so used to seeing him with his classic makeup and pins how they normally look, that maybe I am just not used to seeing it any other way. But regardless, either way it is, I still like the look a lot. I just wouldn’t call it the classic pinheaded look, it’s just a little different take on it. But I especially loved that chatterer, that was insane! Perfect collab. For the pins, I don’t really know anything honestly. but maybe instead of wrapping the tape around the nails, just puncture the nail through the tape so it can lay flat. Or maybe if u had a cast or form or w.e of ur head and just put a bald cap on it or just have a friend help do it on ur head but then maybe they could have just all been stuck on to the bald cap with sprit gum or like liquid latex and flour so u had a thick consistency and could have just put that all over the head and the pins could just stick right into it or maybe even some cotton balls and Latex or w.e.? I dono. I know nothing lol",0,0
