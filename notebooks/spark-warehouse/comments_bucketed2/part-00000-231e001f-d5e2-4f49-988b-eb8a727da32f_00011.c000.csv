I explained my problem to my friend and she suggested that I should rather contact a spell caster that could help me cast a spell to bring him back but I am the type that never believed in spell, I had no choice than to try it, I mailed the spell caster, and he told me there was no problem that everything will be okay before three days, that my ex will return to me before three days, he cast the spell and surprisingly in the second day, it was around 4 pm. My ex called me, I was so surprised, I answered the call and all he said was that he was so sorry for everything that happened that he wanted me to return to him, that he loves me so much. I was so happy and went to him that was how we started living together happily again. Since then, I have made promise that anybody I know that have a relationship problem, I would be of help to such person by referring him or her to the only real and powerful spell caster who helped me with my own problem.

vu_9muoxT50,"Whenever a magician needs to touch something, that's usually where the magic occurs. Unfortunately for Colin, the camera angle right before he asks Heidi to say stop reveals a white item cupped in his right hand (this is of course the magical list of 3 items - Rome/Cheese/Ellen - about to be pressed onto the printed paper wherever she says stop). To see this white item, you'll have to watch the DVR version of the TV broadcast as this internet version has been edited by AGT to remove this reveal. At 03:06, Colin brings this small piece of paper from his right pocket with his right hand. It's all actually a simple slight-of-hand trick performed with far more flair and advance video preparation than wily subterfuge.\\n\\nAlways be suspicious when a magician needs to touch something with any part of their body or any device they are holding.

He's such a good presenter that when Heidi and simon new what was going on they didn't buzz probably because they didn't want to spoil it for america right when they are so happy and anticipated. \n\nAlso it's pretty impressive that howie ordered a Ellen Burger and just everything that happened was impressive.,0,0

Voters shouldn't care about the color of a politician's toupee or pantsuit. What matters is process and, even more so, results, and the person (or, rather, team of people) managing that political process shouldn't be determined by a popularity contest.

She's written a book exploring what happened, which, no matter how you slice it, will mean looking at the reasons why she lost. Being able to reflect on that experience, mistakes and all - and learn from it is pretty important for anyone to be able to do. You won't get far in life if you can't do this. But slather this with kneejerk hatred and it suddenly becomes entirely a blame game! \\n\\nI mean, it takes a deep plunge into the the pit of 'alternative facts' to be able to watch this interview and come away with the conclusion that Hillary is simply doling out blame. And yet, here we are.\\n\\nI say this as an international observer - someone who hasn't been caught up with the hyper-partisanship and tribalism that is clearly afflicting many Americans - you guys need to take a step back and have a good look at yourselves and what you're becoming. What you've already become. When you can't tell fact from fiction at the most basic levels - when your prejudices are affecting your judgement to this extent, something has gone seriously wrong. And as alarming as this is - and it should be alarming to just about everyone - it appears like a huge segment of both media and laypeople (as evidenced in the comment section here) alike are clearly more interested in indulging in their hatred and self satisfied criticism, than giving any thought to the content of the discussion.",0,0

GGm0FQ6i74U,"One of Hillary's problems is that her positions on issues may have seemed more grounded, by they also didn't solve the problem. For example: When Sanders talked about public college being free (through a regulatory measure, similar to what is done in the UK), Hillary's proposal was tuition free college in which tax credits would be given to help subsidize the cost of college, but only for families below a certain income bracket. So you have tax money being used for college credits for certain people, which does nothing to actually curb the out-of-control costs of college education. All it does is give colleges an excuse to increase their tuition rates because now, the money would be coming from the government instead of students. \\n\\nAnother example: Universal Healthcare. Hillary said, 90% of people are covered, so it's easier to just get the other 10%. Maybe. But the 90% don't all have good, or affordable coverage. They're just covered. The plan of extending Obamacare further doesn't do anything to actually curb the out-of-control costs of healthcare, because her plan continued to see cooperation with the money-sucking insurance companies. See? There's a pattern here.",0,0

GGm0FQ6i74U,"I definitely think Hillary Clinton's viewpoint that the American people care about details, analyses, facts, and legislative precision was inaccurate. A large portion of both the primaries and the general election *is* a personality contest, whether we like to admit it or not. You need to learn to appeal to different crowds while still maintaining a focus on your agenda items.\\n\\nIt wasn't that Hillary didn't have that focus - I think she expended far too much energy in maintaining it, and not enough on figuring out what crowds wanted, or how to tailor her speeches so that both laypeople and those in-the-know would get a sense of who she was as a person and leader.\\n\\nThe end result of the loss can be blamed on the timing of a variety of events and the presence of a variety of scandals, real or imagined, but a large part of the responsibility lies with how she chose to run a data-centric, cold-and-clinical campaign. I hope future leaders learn from her missteps.\\n\\nAs for her commentary on Obama and her husband...I don't think they ran anywhere near as clinically as she believes. I do think they were more capable of being a visionary, of matching personalities with their opponents.",0,0

uBGECC5U09Q,"This proper shit movie got me really angry. A shop keeper would have made more intelligent decisions than this idiotic ''astronauts''.   I also have a question. How do those while aliens see ? They have no eyes.

AAZbviHZVhE,"Dear Friends..\\n\\nOne day soon for all of us all of these distractions will not matter. There is a real battle for souls right now going on and millions upon billions are being lured away by satanic forces, spending all of their time, money and energy on everything except God.\\n\\nThere is a real place called heaven, and one called hell.   Hell is said to be eternal torment and separation from God, where there is no more hope ever.  Likely a most horrid place you wouldn't want any one to go for 5 minutes let alone trillions upon trillions of years...forever.  \\n\\nSee here; \\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5gv-V9axtg\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLOAUB9Vjo0\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vywj182oFw\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDsn5v4pdgY\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmp3UNjeu0k\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15k-1V2gx6I\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2G6yFeWmw8\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYAVkuNk8pU\\n\\nHave you ever stopped to really think about how little time you may have left on this planet?  I mean really let it sink in and think about it.  What are you spending your short amount of time on? Friend..Do you know absolutely sure 100% if you died today where you would go?  Jesus said what would it profit you if you gained everything in this entire world, but you lost your own soul...in hell FOREVER.  Jesus asked what would you give in exchange for your own soul?\\n\\nFortunately God desires all to come be with him forever and it is an awesome place beyond description forever and ever...\\nTo make this possible Jesus came to pay for our punishment our sin, our destination without God, and to bring us home to the most awesome, loving inconceivable place for all eternity. But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\\n\\nAlso all of us have done wrong things and broken laws that God gave us.  Don't worry you don't get to heaven by being a good person.  And there aren't many different paths to heaven.  Fortunately there is a way that everyone who has done bad things can change and go to heaven forever and ever.  God said there is only one way to heaven..not many paths and fortunately we don't get there by being a good person\\n\\nIn John 14:6 Jesus said to him, “I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. Nobody goes to heaven without Jesus.  Plain and simple that is how we go to heaven.  Not by being good, or following many different paths...it comes down to Jesus and Jesus alone.  What is required?  Well we learn that what is required is to repent of our wrong doings, and believe on the Jesus, and endure to the end of our lives continuing in our faith in Jesus.\\n\\nIt all comes down to this...will you Believe on and Trust Jesus today.  Change your eternal destiny right now be laying your trust in the only thing that can save us and fill the void in our hearts. Jesus Christ.\\n\\nWill you trust on him Before its too late!\\n\\nYou will all meet him VERY Soon whether in this life or the soon coming afterlife!\\n\\nWill you put your trust in him right now friend?\\n\\nPlease let this settle in deeply.  When you draw your last breath that God gives you, which could happen any moment.  In that moment you draw your last breath...the only thing that will matter is What YOU did with Jesus in this life....nothing else at all in that moment will matter..nothing else (everything but that is temporary and fading).  What you did with Jesus in this life will be the ONLY thing left that will matter in the moment you draw your final breath.  You cannot at this time begin to conceive just how important this message is.  I pray that you will take heed to it while their is still a short time for you to do so, and it is everlastingly too late for you.  Please friends do not ignore or delay in this serious message about turning to Jesus right now, and truly following him the rest of your days. \\n\\nHas anyone ever told you that: GOD LOVES YOU & has a wonderful plan for your life?\\nI have a real quick but important question to ask you... If you died tonight, would you go to heaven?\\n\\nMuch Love to You\\n\\n(If you found value in this message please share this crucial message of hope with as many people as possible).\\n\\nhttp://howtofollowjesus.net\\nhttp://embarktoheaven.info",0,1

JJc1Tqcu-8E,Yesterday for the 1st time I saw The Fate of the Fast and Furious. A much as Tyrese lead off into a rant. Going by how the movie ended. I completely get why he is saying what he is saying. \n\n*Spoiler*\n\nThe movie ends off with everyone from the original cast and the now retired Rock sitting at a table all together and calling themselves family. Basically moving together as one unit. This is literally portrayed and Flashbacked on through out the entire movie. Where people you've seen in prior Fast & Furious movies were revealed in the latest movie. That you had no idea was there till they revealed there scenes. \n\nNow you have a franchise built on this ideal being ripped apart by The Rock who wants a solo movie not including any of them. To which makes no sense being that he quit his government work and dedicated himself to his daughter and this new Fast Family. \n\nI can see why Tyrese is concerned. Being the message of sticking together that the movie portrayed for over a decade is being torn apart by a solo actor wanting to do a solo project. Who might not even do it justice given his recent flop of movies. Thus this would be alarming. Being he could literally destroy everything they built over the years in just 1 solo movie project.  \n\nI don't think its about him getting his own gig or jealousy. Yet more of trying to maintain the brand.,0,0

sD6RIeNP41I,I'm a ggg fan but for me canelo clearly won! A lot of casual fans know nothing about boxing and think that just because one fighter is moving forward and more aggressive he wins. Most of ggg's shots either hit the glove or missed completely. Canelo got much more power shots and his counter punching was so impressive it reminded me of Floyd Mayweather a little bit.,0,0

sD6RIeNP41I,"GGG won that fight... it was close, but not close enough to not be able to see a clear winner. The judge who was banging Canelo clearly was cherry picked by the promoter.

sD6RIeNP41I,"Triple G fan being delusional. He probably lost money on the fight and that's why he is pissed. All the Triple G fans were saying that he was going to destroy Canelo and knock him down. Triple G took the hardest punches the whole night. His legs wobble in the 10th round and then took hard punches round 11 and 12. I too saw triple G winning but surprised about the draw I was not because both boxers did their job at the ring.canelo was great avoiding Triple G best shots while at the same time manage to land the best shots through the night. Point was Triple G won. But this isn't Mayweather anymore, this is Canelo's time and to beat Canelo you need to beat him at his game and Triple G didn't do that.",0,0
sD6RIeNP41I,This guy is crazy. It's a draw not a Canelo win. Look at compubox. If anything Canelo got robbed. Canelo landed 41.9% of his power punches compared to GGG 32.2% Also Canelo landed 33.5% total punches to GGG's 31%. That's a close fight. \n\nYes 118-110 is horrible but it doesn't mean Canelo rigged the fight to a draw. If anyone cheats they cheat to win not tie.,0,0

XSLc0d5aM04,I have a feeling that this man was passed around the elite pedophile rings in the music industry when he was in his preteen and teen years. A lot of childstars are subjected to sexual abuse and mk ultra mind control in hollyweird. That's why you see so many childstars have mental breakdowns or major substance abuse issues in their mid to late 20's. Around that age they start to remember those repressed memories and the unimaginable abuse they endured and their mind cannot simply comprehend the trauma of the abuse. That's why you see 99% turn into full blown addicts and suffer from mental illness. Why when Brittany shaved her head did she tell the stylist to cut her hair off? She told the stylist that she was sick of people hacking her brain and plugging shit into her mind. Sounds like mind control to me. Everyone needs to research pedophilia and mk ultra mind control in the entertainment industry. Youtube Jay Myers he has a few great documentary on the subject. It will blow you away.,1,0

I'll stay in my room and not leave my place for 3 full days when I'm off because I'm afraid of people looking at me and still thinking I look like a skeleton druggie with all these problems even though I have changed back so much to myself before all the drugs but I'll always be different from the scary experiences I've been through etc. Everyday I think about suicide but I'm too scared to actually ever do it so I hermit at all my off times. 😢",1,1

Mayweather was a log his whole career in what this idiots saying, yet he's 50-0. There's the argument punches landed but in reality I'm looking at quality of punches. Canelo threw less but his had much more quality. It's a draw Teddy, get over it. That 118-110 call was BS, but just because you land weak jabs all fight does not make you the winner.

XSLc0d5aM04,I have a feeling that this man was passed around the elite pedophile rings in the music industry when he was in his preteen and teen years. A lot of childstars are subjected to sexual abuse and mk ultra mind control in hollyweird. That's why you see so many childstars have mental breakdowns or major substance abuse issues in their mid to late 20's. Around that age they start to remember those repressed memories and the unimaginable abuse they endured and their mind cannot simply comprehend the trauma of the abuse. That's why you see 99% turn into full blown addicts and suffer from mental illness. Why when Brittany shaved her head did she tell the stylist to cut her hair off? She told the stylist that she was sick of people hacking her brain and plugging shit into her mind. Sounds like mind control to me. Everyone needs to research pedophilia and mk ultra mind control in the entertainment industry. Youtube Jay Myers he has a few great documentary on the subject. It will blow you away.,1,0

ZGlYvprDKNM,"Arguably the scariest magical item of  your universe, a  cell phone feeds upon human happiness and leaves its victim in a state of depression and despair. The Dark creature's ultimate weapon is called the Wifi, which it gives when it removes its cloak, clamps its jaw around a victim's mouth, and sucks out his or her soul. This fate is often considered worse than death. The Wifi leaves the person in a persistent vegetative state, and a person in this condition does not have the option of becoming a ghost, since a person's soul must be in tact to roam the earth. Cell phones are among the foulest items that are on this earth. They infest the darkest, filthiest places, they glory in decay and despair, they grow like fungus where it is decay, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around them... Get too near a cell phone and every good feeling, every happy memory will be sucked out of you. If it can, the cell phone will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like itself... soulless and evil. You will be left with nothing but the worst experiences of your life.",0,0

sD6RIeNP41I,"Fucc all Gennady dicc riders that repeat everything you hear. Y'all thought that Canelo would get destroyed and that did not happen at All. Did y'all watch the entire fight? Either Canelo is not bad like y'all thought or Gennady is not as beast as he usually is against opponents of lower caliber. It was very close. I gave Canelo rounds 1-4, 10, 12 and 11 was a good one too. That's seven rounds but if I missed one I agree with a draw but I don't agree with the score card. That's what has all of the Gennady dicc riders talking shit. I definitely don't agree that Gennady won. They both connected a lot of punches and power punches. Yes Canelo was against the ropes a lot but if Gennady misses punches, which he missed a lot and Canelo blocked a lot of them, then that doesn't mean shit. Gennady's punches didn't really affect Canelo that's why he worked Gennady late in the match in the 10th and 12th rounds. Gennady almost fell twice I believe, on two separate occasions. Did y'all see their faces after the Match? Canelo surprised everyone except those nothing knowing ass followers. Give him some damn credit.",0,0

sD6RIeNP41I,Canelo didnt win i thought it was a draw GGG landed more punches 218 to 169 but over a 12 rd fight thats about 4 more landed punches per round not a lot so it was a close fight but Canelo was more accurate with his power punches throwing less landed more 114/272 almost 42 % now ggg threw more landed less 110/342 at 32 % but the big difference was in the jab Ggg threw more and landed more 108/361 about 30% Canelo 55/233 at 24% so i dont think Ggg won because he only land more jabs than Canelo he also miss more but 8 to 4 or 7 to 5 either way or a draw(my choice) is acceptable but not 118 to 110 no way,0,0

Canelo couldn't get pass g jabs. Canelo should had took it in the middle of the ring but instead ran to the ropes. Yes g miss a lot punches but he landed more and he was more aggressive. But boxing rigg. Triple g shouldn't take the rematch unless he is the A side. Plus Canelo got his ass boo by his Mexican fan because they knew he lost clearly. When I heard 118-110 Canelo? This fight was rigg and setup.,0,0

GGG had many opportunities to throw flurries and he chose not to. Canelo danced around and did some showboating just to entertain the viewers. It was a setup for a future money grab and rematch.

Between GGG missing a lot, and Canelo countering well, that could certainly skew some rounds in Canelo's favor. Sometimes people forget that more landed punches in a round isn't the only significant statistic in a boxing match. Anyways, 118-110 is disgusting; we all know that's BS!

Mayweather was a log his whole career in what this idiots saying, yet he's 50-0. There's the argument punches landed but in reality I'm looking at quality of punches. Canelo threw less but his had much more quality. It's a draw Teddy, get over it. That 118-110 call was BS, but just because you land weak jabs all fight does not make you the winner.

RLmqKBRqyA8,the set looks awesome but im a little dissappointed with the build. I know this is a model for show only but they could have made some more secure connections around the ship and i dont like how some of the top plate builds just sit and rest. I figured the build would have been solid so that you could pick it up with no pieces falling off and move it around if you needed to...........think i might pass on this and get the lego ghostbusters firehouse instead,0,0

XSLc0d5aM04,I have a feeling that this man was passed around the elite pedophile rings in the music industry when he was in his preteen and teen years. A lot of childstars are subjected to sexual abuse and mk ultra mind control in hollyweird. That's why you see so many childstars have mental breakdowns or major substance abuse issues in their mid to late 20's. Around that age they start to remember those repressed memories and the unimaginable abuse they endured and their mind cannot simply comprehend the trauma of the abuse. That's why you see 99% turn into full blown addicts and suffer from mental illness. Why when Brittany shaved her head did she tell the stylist to cut her hair off? She told the stylist that she was sick of people hacking her brain and plugging shit into her mind. Sounds like mind control to me. Everyone needs to research pedophilia and mk ultra mind control in the entertainment industry. Youtube Jay Myers he has a few great documentary on the subject. It will blow you away.,1,0

Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \\nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\\n\\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\\n\\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\\n\\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\\n\\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\\n\\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\\n\\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\\n\\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\\n\\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\\n\\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\\n\\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\\n\\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\\n\\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \\n\\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\\n\\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",0,0

ZGlYvprDKNM,"Wil, be careful with your EXTREME HOT SAUCE taste. I think it's very bad for your health. Please check with your doctor.\\nWhen I started working and had to go thru my first official work related doctor check-up, they found traces of blood in my urine. One of the advice to me was to avoid HOT stuff. Too much of it supposedly might SLICE your inner organ and cause bleeding. I recalled a fondness for hot sauce but nowhere near your level. Two weeks of lots of water therapy and I was given a clean bill of health. This observation might just be an old wives' tale but please double check with your doctor. \\n\\nYour EXTREME, FANATIC, OVER-THE-TOP, ALMOST OBSESSIVE and ABUSIVE CONSUMPTION of hot sauce on your food at every given opportunity (base on your pass blogs) cannot be healthy at best and certainly not now when your at a weaken condition due to your sickness and going thru chemotherapy.

And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \\nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\\n\\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\\n\\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\\n\\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\\n\\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\\n\\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\\n\\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\\n\\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\\n\\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\\n\\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\\n\\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\\n\\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\\n\\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \\n\\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\\n\\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",0,0

There are places in USA that have over 90 percent success with cancer also. You are a You Tuber trust in it search and you will find the true natural answer. What you are doing to your body also kills good cells and your white blood cells that fight for you. You are listening to Doctors and they do not cure your problems.

Are they going to be lovers of their flesh more then lovers of their God/Creator??? And here is the scriptural Proff in the scriptures)))...  \\nThen the Lord said, The outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great and their sins so grievous that I will go down and see if what they have done is as bad as the outcry that has reached me, if not, I will know. (Genesis 18:20-21). Before they had gone to bed, all the men from every part of the city of Sodom-Both young and old-surrounded the house. They called to lot, Where are the men, (Two Angels), who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can have sex with them. (Genesis 19:4-5). Get out of our way, They replied. And they said, This fellow, (Angels), came here as alien, and now they want to play the judge we'll treat you worse than them.  They kept bringing pressure on Lot and moved forward to break down the door. But the men/Angels inside reached out and pulled Lot back into the house and shut the door. Then the Men/Angels struck the men who were at the door of the house young and old, with blindness so that they could not find the door. (Genesis 19:9-11). The Angels said to Lot, Get your relatives out of here, Because we are going to destroy this place. The outcry to the Lord against its people is so great that he has sent us to destroy it. (Genesis 19:12-13).\\n\\nDo not lie with a man as one lies with a women; it is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:22). If a man lies with a man as one lies with a women, both of them have committed an abomination. They must be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads. (Leviticus 20:13). A woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear women's clothing, for all that do so are an abomination unto the Lord thy God. (Deuteronomy 22:5). There were even Sodomites in the land; The people engaged in all the abomination practices of the nations the Lord had driven out before the Israelites. (1 Kings 14:24).\\n\\n Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as his father David had done. He expelled the Sodomites from the land and got rid of all the idols his fathers had made. (1 Kings 15:11-12). He rid the land of the rest of the Sodomites who remained there even after the reign of his father Asa. (1 Kings 22:46). He also tore down the quarters of the Sodomites that were by the house of the Lord and where women did weaving for Asherah. (2 Kings 23:7). No one who has been emasculated/castrated by cutting or crushing the male sex organ may enter the assembly of the Lord. (Deuteronomy 23:1).\\n\\nGod gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion. (Romans 1:26-27). (Homosexual/Sodomite sympathizers), although they know God's righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things, but also approve of those who practice them. (Romans 1:32). Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the fornicators, nor idolaters nor adulterers nor Homosexual/Effeminate/Sodomites nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And that is what some of you were. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the spirit of our God. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11). That the law is not made for a righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murders of fathers and mothers, for manslayers, for fornicators, for Sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine. ( 1 Timothy 1:9-10). Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding towns gave themselves up to fornication and going after strange flesh, (Homosexual/Sodomites). They serve as an example of those who suffer the punishment of eternal fire. (Jude 7). Dear friends, I urge you, as aliens and strangers in the world, to abstain from fleshly desires, which war against your souls. (1 Peter 2:11).\\n\\n Everyone that is Proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord: though they join forces, none will go unpunished. (Proverbs 16:5). Pride goes before destruction, a haughty spirit before a fall. (Proverbs 16:18). To fear the Lord is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil behavior and perverse speech. (Proverbs 8:13). He (God) beholdeth all high things: He (Satan) is a king over all the children of pride. (Job 41:34). God opposed the Proud but gives grace to the humble. (James 4:6).\\n\\nThe look on their faces testifies against them; they parade their sin like Sodom; they do not hide it, Woe to them! They have brought disaster upon themselves. (Isaiah 3:9). God is just: He will pay back to those who trouble you, and give relief to you who are troubled, and to us as well. This will happen when The Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful Angel punishing those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our lord Jesus. They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out of the presence of the Lord. (2 Thessalonians 1:7-9). Call on to Jesus for forgiveness and He will set you free and be your God. Jesus said: Unless you are born again, (With the Holy spirit), you cannot enter the Kingdom of God. (John 3:3).\\n\\nJesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Parish. (Luke 13:3). Don't you know that you yourself are Gods temple and that God spirit lives in you? If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy them; For Gods temple is sacred, and you are that temple. (1 Corinthians 3:16-17). So if the Sodomite commit, or anyone by that matter commit suicide and not repent of their sins. Jesus said: Unless you repent you will all likewise Perish. (Luke 13:3).\\n\\nThey will be cast into outer darkness. Where there will be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, where the worm never dies and the fire is never quenched. Jesus said in, (Luke 13:28), (Matthew 13:42), (Matthew 25:29-30), (Matthew 8:12), (Matthew 22:13), (Mark 9:48).\\n\\nSee Jesus always talked about Hell, but people never wanted to talk or hear about it. Always love love love. But people are going to find out about Gods wrath the hard way if they keep going to these false ministers and living in Sin.\\n\\nJesus said: Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the son of man. (Luke 6:22). Jesus said: Woe to you when all men speak well of you, for that is how their fathers treated the false Prophets. (Luke 6:26). Jesus said: If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. (John 15:18). Jesus said: If you belong to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world that is why the world hates you. (John 15:19).\\n\\nAm I now trying to win the approval of men, or of God? Or am I trying to please men? If I were still trying to please men, I would not be a servant of Christ. (Galatians 1:10).\\n\\nJesus said: the world does not hate you, but It hates me because I testify its works are evil. (John 7:7).\\nJesus said: Nevertheless I tell you the truth; it is expedient for you that I go away, the comforter/Holy spirit will not come unto you, but if I depart, I will send him unto you, and when he comes, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of Judgment: of sin, because they believe not on me. (John 16:7).\\n\\nTopheth ,(Hell), has long been prepared; it has been made ready for the king (Satan). Its fire pit has been made deep and wide with an abundance of fire and wood; the breath of the Lord, like a stream of burning sulfur, sets it ablaze. (Isaiah 30:33).  \\n\\nJesus said: Then he will say to those on his left. Depart from me, you who are cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels. (Matthew 25:41).\\n\\nThis is not a hate speech, this is love speech. Please don't trample on the Blood of Jesus. He wants to save you and set you free. I love each and every one of you, just like Jesus did on the cross for you and me.",0,0

They are definitely using their name now to sell products instead of using the product to sell products. \\nYou can’t tell me that a company that raves on their engineers couldn’t at least made the iPhone 8 & 8+ screen bigger, but I’m sure they knew what they were doing. It looks like they had some supplies left over from the 7 & 7+ and didn’t want to waste them. Sure it would of cost them a little more to make the screens bigger but not as much as the Samsung OLED screen for the X. They also did not want to directly compete with the iPhone X with the iPhone 8 so they made little changes just enough not to overshadow their iPhone X. If  would of made screen bigger on the 8 more people would of bought it taking away from the X’s sells. I can’t think of any other logical reason that  would purposely make the phone the same for 4 years in a row. \\n\\nP.S.  These Benchmark test are ridiculous and inaccurate.

It's a bit disappointing I was never able to run my MK2s reliably before the announcement of its successor. Also not to be able to fully upgrade to the new model does not leave a warm and fuzzy feeling. It is understandable from the hardware point of view, though. I might spring for the 2.5 upgrade because print-speed was never much of a concern to me and all my real MK2 issues have been addressed and probably been resolved with this upgrade.\\n\\nI don't want to end on a negative note. I think your design is terrific and when the MK2 printed it did so in astonishing quality in regard to the price. So - thumbs up for the new model - it's one step huge closer to what regular consumers might want - even if that is not your target audience. Cheers! JM",0,0

hwNIzQLtHnU,Had this for 30 days and the head burnt up. I contacted them and they tried to sell me more parts to fix it. THEY assembled it. And because THEY screwed up they wanted to charge me more money to fix it. I waited 6 months for them to ship it. i paid full price for the unit and the build. after a few emails about the issues i was having they simply stop responding. 100%  UNHAPPY with this company.,1,0
hwNIzQLtHnU,I got mine MK2S just a few days ago and got a broken part (gently pushed a nut in and it cracked) and a faulty PINDA probe which caused a damaged printing surface. Now you release a new printer. Great. I'm pretty curious what the support thinks about that.,0,1
hwNIzQLtHnU,"You printers are great but your video skills SUCK. Maybe invest some of that sweet profit into someone who knows how to make good videos? And why does it cost more in euro than in USD? WTF? THis shit it manufactured in europe! 749 USD = 630€, even with 20% tax added that's 756€ and not 769€",6,7

hwNIzQLtHnU,Bought the MK2S because everybody on the internet tells you that Prusa has a great support. Yeah.

I received my first 3D printer just days before the MK3 was announced and hat to pay the old price (130 Euros difference). Then I had a cracked part after pushing a nut in and due to an loose connection in the PINDA-cable the nozzle crashed into the printing bed after perfect calibration.

It's a bit disappointing I was never able to run my MK2s reliably before the announcement of its successor. Also not to be able to fully upgrade to the new model does not leave a warm and fuzzy feeling. It is understandable from the hardware point of view, though. I might spring for the 2.5 upgrade because print-speed was never much of a concern to me and all my real MK2 issues have been addressed and probably been resolved with this upgrade.\\n\\nI don't want to end on a negative note. I think your design is terrific and when the MK2 printed it did so in astonishing quality in regard to the price.

As a consumer I like that cuz nobody else is  doing that. In my opinion if I had an iPhone 7 I wouldn't get the 8 but coming from Android I'd consider it I just hate they copied Samsung and got a glass back. I liked the back on the 7,0,0

I’ve had several iPhones and none of them have ever slow down my iPhone 6s Plus is as fast is the day and I got it or year and a half ago. Keep the great videos common.,1,0

NPptT6BsnWQ,"This proves that Apple is a money making company for itself, regardless of what the consumer wants or thinks. They are definitely using their name now to sell products instead of using the product to sell products. \\nYou can’t tell me that a company that raves on their engineers couldn’t at least made the iPhone 8 & 8+ screen bigger, but I’m sure they knew what they were doing. It looks like they had some supplies left over from the 7 & 7+ and didn’t want to waste them. Sure it would of cost them a little more to make the screens bigger but not as much as the Samsung OLED screen for the X. They also did not want to directly compete with the iPhone X with the iPhone 8 so they made little changes just enough not to overshadow their iPhone X. If  would of made screen bigger on the 8 more people would of bought it taking away from the X’s sells. I can’t think of any other logical reason that  would purposely make the phone the same for 4 years in a row. \\n\\nP.S.  These Benchmark test are ridiculous and inaccurate. Please stop running them",0,1

ZYSjPZUqLdk,"CORRECTIONS AND Q'S A'ed:\\n1. NIXON WAS NEVER ACTUALLY IMPEACHED. He resigned. Articles of impeachment passed out of committee, but he resigned before the impeachment vote. MY MISTAKE.\\n\\n2. Why didn't you talk about Ukraine's support of Hillary Clinton? This is a good and interesting question. There is some evidence that Ukraine's government sought to influence the election for Clinton (although it was not nearly as extensive as the meddling by the government of Russia). But as I say in the video, benefiting from a propaganda campaign is not a crime, and no evidence has emerged that any Clinton staffers received or accepted any thing of value. So I didn't talk about it because it wasn't the topic of the video.\\n\\n3. Why didn't you talk about the incredibly coincidental timing of later in the summer and Trump asking Russia to release Clinton's 33,000 emails? Okay, so lots of people believe that it's not a coincidence that Donald Trump Jr. said later in the summer and then the DNC emails were indeed released later in the summer, and that it's not a coincidence that (then-candidate) Trump asked Russia to release Clinton's emails very shortly after the meeting between the Kremlin-connected Lawyer and Manafort/Kushner/Donald Trump Jr. And maybe it isn't a coincidence, but it seems perfectly possible to me that it IS a coincidence.\\n\\n4. Did you ignore evidence that Putin wasn't behind the DNC hack? Not to my knowledge. The sources I link to above are very convincing. I think it's important to remember here that there is VERY BROAD CONSENSUS across political parties among U.S. leaders that the Russian government was behind the DNC hack, as well as the other facets of their campaign to influence the election. They've seen information that we don't have, and they ALL consider it to be credible. If there were more Republicans saying, Wait a minute, as was the case with Democrats and the intelligence about WMD in Iraq, I'd be more hesitant. As it is, I think it's just a very inconvenient fact for a lot of people's political narratives that Putin decided whose emails we got to read in the runup to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.\\n\\n5. Why didn't you mention Carter Page or Roger Stone or et cetera? Because the video was already nine minutes long, and also because most of the people you're asking about left Trump's official campaign relatively early on. It's important to remember that these days a LOT of U.S. political consultants do business abroad. I don't think in and of itself that should be a red flag.\\n\\n6. John Podesta was the chairman of Clinton's campaign, not of the DNC. MY MISTAKE.\\n\\n7. Why didn't you talk about Trump drafting the untrue initial press release for Donald Trump Jr? There's reporting about this here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/us/politics/trump-was-involved-in-drafting-sons-statement-aide-confirms.html Some people think this is a crime (likely obstruction of justice), but it seems a stretch to me. They made the meeting to be about adoption; it's perfectly possible that adoption was mentioned. That doesn't strike me as a likely crime. If we put every politician or businessperson in prison who massaged the truth in a press release, our incarceration rate would be very high, indeed. \\n\\nI'll add more answers (and corrections, I'm sure) as they come in. Thanks for watching. -John",749,85

I remember last year with just the kapernick thing ratings were visibly going down. If the owners of the team say they do not want that sort of advertising(that could potentially cost a loss in revenue) then they should have that right as the players are their representatives. Now if the owners are completely cool with it(losing revenue) then by all means do whatever you want with your company. It ain't my dime.

qdWUQGHtyPk,"1) Trump has had it out for the NFL ever since he was an owner of a former USFL team.  Trump had sued the NFL for having a monopoly on professional football because his team and football league had a hard time going up against the NFL for viewership and profitability.  The thing was he actually won, but what he won was nothing more than a public slap to his ego in the form of a whole one dollar bill -- that's 100 centavos -- and to add insult to injury the usfl folded soon thereafter costing him a small fortune.  How could he not now be trying to vindictively destroy the NFL knowing the type of petty animal he is? \\n\\n2) The Westboro baptist church truly disrespects those service members who paid the ultimate price by protesting at their funerals with disgusting and vile signs that state how the deceased veteran is burning in hell because of America's sins, and all the while the parents of the KIA service members are present having to witness their protests without having the ability to confront them because they to are exercising their rights to freedom of speech and expression that were deemed constitutional by the US Supreme Court a few years back, but I don't hear trump condemning their unpatriotic and disturbing behavior as the WBC continue their protests to this day.",0,0
qdWUQGHtyPk,"My thoughts on the NFL stupidness: Everyone knows that in the NFL taking a knee means intentionally ending a play and in most cases the game. So by doing so they clearly are admitting defeat, after all taking a knee is subservient and when protesting it's called taking a stand. So, poor symbolic gestures aside, the whole thing is ridiculous. I understand the right of freedom of speech, but no one at the game is there for that and it takes away from the experience. This is their job, it's entertainment, not a political debate.  Not to mention the poor singer is being incredibly insulted by players who don't even come onto the field. Now all that being said, I personally don't care that they're doing it, if anything it adds to the clown fiesta that is the NFL. For me the real issue is this is all just the same grandstanding, shit-slinging, and finger pointing that happens with literally every other controversial topic.

Part of what makes the American flag so powerful to me is that it still represents an ideology that would protect those who protest it. Normally I would say that I'm a casual Trump supporter (liked him more than Hillary but he wasn't my preferred candidate) but the fact that he is going after people from the position of President is very concerning. Not going to hyperbolize the situation and call him a dictator (he isn't) but I do think he needs to be aware of the importance his office holds more often.\\n\\nP.S.

qdWUQGHtyPk,"I feel that freedom of speech & expression, which is most certainly under assault from those who want to control speech in the United States today, is also powerfully exercised by refusing to say or do something that everyone expects you to. I sit during the cultish rituals of patriotism at sports events, or in any other setting. Quite simply, I do not pledge my undying support to any symbol, or especially any *state* at all -- especially for the odd reason that I happened to be born on a specific plot of dirt. And the amount of unfocused anger some people are willing to raise in knee-jerk reaction to that almost feels enough to justify my choice on its own. I don't think it's edgy. It might be, but I don't enjoy it. I wish others joined with me. It just feels like a more powerful response than merely explaining to people how I feel, just because of how ingrained all of the ritual is into American culture now.",0,0

There's a legitimate reasoning behind NK/Venezuela, but the only reason they're being put on is to make it not a muslim ban.\\nIt's a political statement to add them on there, saying we won't support countries that won't behave, but the ONLY reason trump even cares is to try and get people to not view it as a muslim ban. There's SO many changes and countries that should be added and/or removed if it's actually about making a political statement, or national security. These are just the easy ones. They don't have to reach or research, it's just common knowledge that there's serious issues with these 2 countries.... and Venezuela isn't even a national security issue. They're a moral and humanitarian issue, not a security issue. They're simply not a threat to the US.",0,0

qdWUQGHtyPk,"My personal opinion (being of a mixed ethnic background and being targeted from racists and racial bullying in my young formative years) on the peaceful protesting of the sportsball variety is this: I have no issue with the players kneeling, staying in their locker rooms or locking arms to show their support against racial inequality. That being said, I will stand, remove my hat, and hold my hand over my heart because I hold the flag dear to me as a lot of my family and friends have served their country overseas. I see the flag as a symbol of them and not the big wigs in DC.   \\n\\nSo again, I have no issue with the ones who choose to use this kneeling and/or locking arms as a way to protest.

The mothers will leave abandoned kittens in the garage like they know we will take care of them. Some are so tiny that they have to be tube fed and others bottle or dish works fine. Once they are healthy and used to human contact they get adopted. I recently lost one that I fell in love with; he was an orange tabby and he had 28 toes and I named him Gizmo, MoMo for short. We have a doggie door and he used to love to go outside and lay in the grass in the sunshine or go hunt for mice. One day he came home after someone shot him and by the time we came home and found him laying on the dining room floor he had already lost too much blood to save him. We never did find out who shot my beautiful and loving cat.",0,0

NPptT6BsnWQ,"Apple doesn't upgrade their phones enough, how can you get excited when the only change is wireless charging? In the space of 2 years, I upgraded from an HTC M8 to a Galaxy S8, here's the list of changes - wireless charging, curved edge screen, 3x better camera, fingerprint scanner, iris scanner, 2x RAM, 4x Storage, virtual reality, all the S health stuff.\\n\\nThe best thing about getting a new phone is showing your mates all the new shit it does, you don't get that with an iPhone. I get the impression that apple just wanna drain as much money as possible but in doing so they are falling behind, ill admit I've never been an apple guy but competition is healthy, it's what pushes the market forward yet Apple has stopped competing, in terms of what you get for your money, there is no competition between Apple and Samsung.",1,0

NPptT6BsnWQ,"This proves that Apple is a money making company for itself, regardless of what the consumer wants or thinks. They are definitely using their name now to sell products instead of using the product to sell products. \\nYou can’t tell me that a company that raves on their engineers couldn’t at least made the iPhone 8 & 8+ screen bigger, but I’m sure they knew what they were doing. It looks like they had some supplies left over from the 7 & 7+ and didn’t want to waste them. Sure it would of cost them a little more to make the screens bigger but not as much as the Samsung OLED screen for the X. They also did not want to directly compete with the iPhone X with the iPhone 8 so they made little changes just enough not to overshadow their iPhone X. If  would of made screen bigger on the 8 more people would of bought it taking away from the X’s sells. I can’t think of any other logical reason that  would purposely make the phone the same for 4 years in a row. \\n\\nP.S.  These Benchmark test are ridiculous and inaccurate. Please stop running them",0,1
NPptT6BsnWQ,I think new iPhones are so beautiful and I really like how iOS works smoothly with OSX and Apple Watch etc but I honestly got really bored so I moved to a Note 8. It's my first Samsung / Android phone so it felt really weird at first but I'm honestly loving it. The thing I hate the most going from iPhone to the Note is that the keyboard and emoji are sooooo different. It's definitely taking me some time to get used to. Also this isn't super important to me but I definitely noticed that the speakers on the Note are terrible in comparison to the iPhone. I might go back to an iPhone a few years down the line. just the past 3 years i've been very bored with what Apple's brought to the table. I'm a Mac user and I was pleasantly surprised at how good the synergy is.,0,2

I might spring for the 2.5 upgrade because print-speed was never much of a concern to me and all my real MK2 issues have been addressed and probably been resolved with this upgrade.\\n\\nI don't want to end on a negative note.

IqLi6Pn_rVo,"I suffered from acne almost 3 years. I tried a lot of products but it in the end my skin was more damaged as it was in the beginning. The only thing that helped me was aloe vera gel with a tablespoon of pure turmeric powder. Depending on the amount you need of aloe vera gel, just mix a tablespoon of turmeric powder and create a mask. The mask is vegan and cruelty free. The mask will clear your skin and make your skin glow. If you want you can use aloe vera gel afterwards to cool off your skin.",0,0

But as I say in the video, benefiting from a propaganda campaign is not a crime, and no evidence has emerged that any Clinton staffers received or accepted any thing of value. So I didn't talk about it because it wasn't the topic of the video.\\n\\n3. Why didn't you talk about the incredibly coincidental timing of later in the summer and Trump asking Russia to release Clinton's 33,000 emails? Okay, so lots of people believe that it's not a coincidence that Donald Trump Jr. said later in the summer and then the DNC emails were indeed released later in the summer, and that it's not a coincidence that (then-candidate) Trump asked Russia to release Clinton's emails very shortly after the meeting between the Kremlin-connected Lawyer and Manafort/Kushner/Donald Trump Jr. And maybe it isn't a coincidence, but it seems perfectly possible to me that it IS a coincidence.\\n\\n4. Did you ignore evidence that Putin wasn't behind the DNC hack? Not to my knowledge. The sources I link to above are very convincing. I think it's important to remember here that there is VERY BROAD CONSENSUS across political parties among U.S. leaders that the Russian government was behind the DNC hack, as well as the other facets of their campaign to influence the election. They've seen information that we don't have, and they ALL consider it to be credible. If there were more Republicans saying, Wait a minute, as was the case with Democrats and the intelligence about WMD in Iraq, I'd be more hesitant. As it is, I think it's just a very inconvenient fact for a lot of people's political narratives that Putin decided whose emails we got to read in the runup to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.\\n\\n5. Why didn't you mention Carter Page or Roger Stone or et cetera? Because the video was already nine minutes long, and also because most of the people you're asking about left Trump's official campaign relatively early on. It's important to remember that these days a LOT of U.S. political consultants do business abroad. I don't think in and of itself that should be a red flag.\\n\\n6. John Podesta was the chairman of Clinton's campaign, not of the DNC. MY MISTAKE.\\n\\n7. Why didn't you talk about Trump drafting the untrue initial press release for Donald Trump Jr? There's reporting about this here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/us/politics/trump-was-involved-in-drafting-sons-statement-aide-confirms.html Some people think this is a crime (likely obstruction of justice), but it seems a stretch to me. They made the meeting to be about adoption; it's perfectly possible that adoption was mentioned. That doesn't strike me as a likely crime. If we put every politician or businessperson in prison who massaged the truth in a press release, our incarceration rate would be very high, indeed. \\n\\nI'll add more answers (and corrections, I'm sure) as they come in. Thanks for watching. -John",1336,141

But if Obama and Co. used to power of the state to spy on an opposition party during a campaign (we call that a 'fishing expedition'), this is a very real and present threat which can be abused by either party.

qdWUQGHtyPk,"I believe simply that anyone who thinks it's right for any American, let alone the POTUS, to threaten someone for refusing to honor the flag needs to take a closer look at their idea of freedom. Part of being in a free society absolutely means that an individual has the freedom to criticize and disrespect their nation, and while an employer absolutely has the right (assuming it's in their contract) to fire their employees for certain behaviors, and we as citizens absolutely have the right to criticize those taking a knee, to do so while screaming about being a patriot is sad irony.",0,0
qdWUQGHtyPk,"YOU'RE FIRED!  There are 10,080 minutes during the week they're free to do their black power thingy but choosing to do so by disrespecting the flag and the anthem?  BIG MISTAKE!  Whatever the hell it is they're trying to accomplish, rest assured will result in a big dose of the opposite. \\n\\nAnd what business would tolerate their employees (while on the clock) publicly disrespecting their country and pissing off the majority of their customers?  In the meantime ...\\n\\nWhat's with the 'Social Injustice' thingy?  Do they mean by Black Lives Matters standards?  You know, like in Baltimore when the looting (early Christmas shopping) and rioting started before anyone even realized that 3 of the cops were black (much less the facts)?  Or better yet, in Charlotte where a 'black' suspect who won't drop his weapon is shot by a 'black' cop who works for a 'black' police chief who works for a 'black' mayor naturally led to race riots with looting, destruction of property and beating up of whites?  That was special (MLK would have been truly ashamed).\\n\\nBut that's what happens when you automatically assume that if something bad happens to a black suspect that there must not only be wrong-doing, but it 'must' have been racially motivated (that means police vs 'citizen' becomes null and void and blacks have to be treated special?).  And never mind that blacks are 3 times more likely per capita to commit felonies.\\n\\nThe sad part is that had the suspects been other than black, the stories would have never even made it past their local news!!!\\n\\nAnd has anyone noticed that BLM hasn't even found a reason to misbehave (even by their lofty standards) for over a year now (Charlotte, with a change in the White House since)?  So what's the beef?\\n\\nIs it oppression?  We are talking about this millennium right?  Never mind we had a two term black president (how's that for oppressed?), or maybe too little impact on our culture?  That's a joke.  Perhaps not enough successful blacks (or millionaires for that matter) or enough special privileges or special rights?  Oh the oppression!\\n\\nAnd what about the double standards like how come it's OK for affirmative action (race based favoritism), black college funds (ditto), black colleges (ditto), association for the 'advancement' of the race (NAACP - just imagine the furor over a NAAWP), black pride, black advocacy, black this and black that (the list goes on and on and on) ... but yet somehow if you were to replace the word 'black' with 'white' would be considered prejudiced, racist and supremacist?  It does make a good point though for 'racial inequality'.  Speaking of equality, does mean blacks are going to raise their high school graduation rate or cut their crime rate by two thirds?  \\n\\nThat flag by the way, also represents the 100's of thousands of Union Soldiers (Northern Republicans) that died fighting to free the slaves from Southern Democrats.  Guess they never thought of that.\\n\\nAnd yeah, you have the right to embarrass yourselves, but like anything else in life, you're accountable  for your actions.  That's where the rights of others to boo, boycott, and fire your ass kick in.  And last time I checked, pissing people off isn't exactly the way to get what you want - whatever the hell that is (a higher pedestal?).  This is horseshit.\\n\\nAnother shameful day for the NFL punctuated by a player 'celebrating' by pretending to urinate like a dog.  Pretty much sums up the state of the league and the dangers of concussions.\\n\\nYOU'RE FIRED!",0,0
qdWUQGHtyPk,"I agree with what many military vets including all the way back to those that fought in WW2, they fought for the players rights to do what they are doing and support them all the way.  I have seen pictures of vets taking a knee, I have and completely agree with you as well, removing the rights of those to protest removes what that flag should represent.  Trump has done more to divide this nation in 1 year than Obama did in 8, as so many try to claim he did.  I have lost long term friendships and family even that are so brainwashed into this rhetoric but turn a blind eye to all rules that show disrespect.  Those who hang flags at night without a light on it, those that wear clothing with american flags on them, those that let flags touch the ground, those that display the flag horizontal, all of which are documented ways of disrespecting the flag they all love so much but apparently they love to cherry pick the rules they want to force people to follow that fit into their current biased bubbles.  Either follow and get uptight about all the rules or none of the rules, you don't get to pick the ones you like,  like some religion of the flag.  \\n  All Trump has done is totally pervert the message the taking a knee was meant to do.  He succeeded in making you forget this is about murderers who happen to do it while hiding behind a badge getting off with what boils down to a slap on the wrist.  He has won in a sense and to a narcissist like him, he is probably so pleased with himself.  I think it is disgusting and disrespectful to the seat of the white house for a president to abuse his place of power and call for the firing of anyone for any reason.  It disgusts me more and more every day to see what this country is turning into.  There is a huge divide forming and it all stems back to Trump and everything he does.  He is the most divisive president to sit in the highest place of power in this country.",0,0
qdWUQGHtyPk,"excuse my ignorance since I'm American but why does the NFL player feels there is unjust in America? America is the country that provided opportunity for his career in the first place. we need to respect and honor the country first before any debate or dialogue. I disagree with Trump using his influence and power to try to shut down that player's freedom to express dissatisfaction, but he does have the freedom to do so as well.",0,0
qdWUQGHtyPk,"This is going to be long. I have served in the Military. I will always stand for the Anthem. Do I feel there is disrespect in the taking the knee protest... yes. However, that is due to my own personal feelings for the flag, and anthem. They are using their constitutional, inalienable rights of freedom of speech/expression to peacefully protest. I may not agree with how they protest, but I do understand the initial reasoning of the protest. I do feel there could be other more beneficial ways to protest these injustices. I will not condemn though for their protest. I, much like any other personage that has served, swore an oath to uphold the constitution, and defend it. It is in The Oath of Enlistment. Although I have my personal feelings about this particular usage of taking the knee. I would also like to point out that there are several instances in history where taking a knee is considered a high form of respect. One would kneel before royalty. Getting knighted one would kneel. Kneeling was a form of showing fealty. Kneeling before a battle cross is an iconic form of remembrance, and respect for most of the people I served with. ( Battle Cross being a wooden cross grave marker usually, jammed into the ground boots, and dogtags hanging from it helmet on the top, and rifle leaning against it.) One of the biggest issues people do need to remember though with this protest, is that these protestor are protected by their rights from government persecution. That includes our President. He is at the top of our government. Also, a reminder is just because they're exercising their rights, does not make anyone else's usage of those same rights any less valid. All people have these rights.",0,0

qdWUQGHtyPk,"Odd how when it's someone on the right saying or doing some shit that the far left dislikes, they have no problem rallying to get that person fired or run out of town. I do believe your saying is You have the freedom to say what you want, but not freedom from the consequences? Is that right?\\n\\nEither you hold the same fucking standard for everyone, or you are a fool who should be ignored. Period.",0,0
qdWUQGHtyPk,"Freedom of speech does not include a freedom from facing the consequences of your free speech. Every American also has the right to react nonviolently to another's free speech. President Trump only exercised this right. \\nAlso, most of us are not allowed to exercise our freedom of speech right while at our place of employment. If I did this, I would expect to be fired or at least suspended. I'm sure that's true for most Americans.\\nIts funny how the player that started this protest was allowed to do it in the first place. He was allowed to wear socks depicting police officers as pigs on the field. He was allowed to wear a t-shirt supporting Fidel Castro, and Malcolm X during a press conference. How can one protest the uncivil treatment of minorities while supporting a dictator who had a history of violating civil rights and the liberty of his people. Racism in Castro's Cuba toward Black people far outweighs anything you see in today's USA. Yet he was protesting the oppression of blacks and other minorities in this country.\\nThen there is the NFL. After the tragic murders of five Dallas police officers, the Dallas Cowboys asked the NFL if players could wear a decal on their helmets commemorating the officers’ sacrifice. In this case, the NFL did not support its players when they wanted to see change in society. When the Cowboys wanted to send the message that police officers should not be hunted, the NFL denied that right to free speech. The NFL fines players for dancing in the end zone. It threatens fines for 9/11 tributes. It shows leniency for other issues, such as domestic violence. \\nLast, we have the good ole' MSM. It's all about Trump being a white supremacist. Trump has now attacked Jemele Hill, Colin Kaepernick, black NFL players, and Stephen Curry. All have something in common blah blah blah. They are actually trying to say that Trump only goes after black people. Sure, try telling that to psycho Kathy Griffin, Jeb Bush, Carly Fiorina, Ted Cruz, John McCain, Hillary Clinton, or Megyn Kelly. \\nMore leftist liberal spin. More say anything to get the black vote. More absolute BS!",0,0

What about the blacks dieing at the hands of cops? The millions locked up due to bullshit racial disparity when it comes to crack and powder cocaine.

If anything, the inclusion of North Korea in this ban only shows that the government's efforts to assert power and strength over the United States are working.",0,0
qdWUQGHtyPk,I think the NFL Players taking the knee for the national anthem are doing the right thing to support their beliefs and freedom to express themselves as best they can.

I know it probably wasn’t on the radar since hockey isn’t very popular but it’s incredibly relevant to the story that was covered. The NHL is a predominately white league with approximately THIRTY black players. Having the Pittsburgh Penguins confirm they will visit the White House is very telling that they do not care about their POC and LGBTQ fans, despite saying “Hockey is for everyone.” Not only is that incredibly disheartening as a fan of the team and of hockey, it’s horrible timing. They released their statement on Sunday around the same time as the NFL protests were happening. Commentators from all over the league have said that their timing was horrendous, and that had they had a choice they wouldn’t go. It’s embarrassing and upsetting as a fan to know that the face of Pittsburgh’s franchise, of hockey itself, says he is EXCITED to meet with this president, despite being aware of our current social climate.

qdWUQGHtyPk,"I'm not very old, but as a Canadian that grew up in a Conservative Canada, that had a military that went hand in hand smiling with the USA to the middle east I've never seen the American flag as a banner of freedom, or any other positive symbol. I've seen it as the symbol of a bully, as someone with more power than wisdom that lashes out at things it doesn't understand, that's what it has meant to me.

qdWUQGHtyPk,"The star-spangled banner was written by Francis Scott Key in 1814 (or '15 depending on your source), during the war of 1812. It didn't become America's national anthem until 1931.\\n\\nKey, like most people at the time, was racist. One of his biggest issues was with the Colonial Marines, a group of former slaves who fought for the British in exchange for their freedom. These men had overrun Key's company just a few weeks before he wrote the poem.\\n\\nFun fact, we only sing the first of four stanzas. The third alludes to the Colonial Marines,  and suggests that the blood of hirelings and slaves would wash away the footsteps of the British.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, I'm glad the British lost. I love this country. A large part of that is because we can freely have discussions like this. But our anthem is a ballad of war from a time where institutional racism was not just the norm, but law.\\n\\nThat being said, I believe the protests aren't about the anthem or the flag, it's about that institutional racism that still exists today, and the social injustice that stems from that system.\\n\\nAnd also the fact that our Commander (or rather Complainer) in Chief is an ass.",0,0

qdWUQGHtyPk,NASCAR drivers used to sit in their cars during the anthem. The NFL didn't do these anthem ceremonies until the military paid them too. This is not about a flag or anthem or the military. The military doesn't protect a cloth it protects the citizens of this country. Some citizens have been under siege lately by police over reach with no repercussions. Where is the military at in protecting those citizens? They took an oath to protect American citizens from threats foreign and domestic this over militarization of the police is a threat to our nation that we should all be standing against.

qdWUQGHtyPk,I will put this to you Phil as a business man. What would you do if you had an employee that used their position on your show to start protesting something? Let's say it is some very important issue. Let's say you even agree with their protest. Day after day during office hours they would build a banner and stick it on the wall behind you in your recording studio. Would you be interfering with your employees free speech if you said you can't put that up there? Would you mind paying somebody who was spending 1 or 2 hours every day to make a sign or some other way to protest? How would your other employees feel about this protester after a week or 2 of this.

xEKSJLaiZa0,You are not supposed to cook the miso for minutes. It actually looses flavour the longer you cook it. You are suposed to add it disolved at the last step and then turn the stove off inmediatly or ideally just before adding it. You'll realise like that that a little bit of miso will add more flavour than a lot of it cooked for minutes,6,0

ZYSjPZUqLdk,"CORRECTIONS AND Q'S A'ed:\\n1. NIXON WAS NEVER ACTUALLY IMPEACHED. He resigned. Articles of impeachment passed out of committee, but he resigned before the impeachment vote. MY MISTAKE.\\n\\n2. Why didn't you talk about Ukraine's support of Hillary Clinton? This is a good and interesting question. There is some evidence that Ukraine's government sought to influence the election for Clinton (although it was not nearly as extensive as the meddling by the government of Russia). But as I say in the video, benefiting from a propaganda campaign is not a crime, and no evidence has emerged that any Clinton staffers received or accepted any thing of value. So I didn't talk about it because it wasn't the topic of the video.\\n\\n3. Why didn't you talk about the incredibly coincidental timing of later in the summer and Trump asking Russia to release Clinton's 33,000 emails? Okay, so lots of people believe that it's not a coincidence that Donald Trump Jr. said later in the summer and then the DNC emails were indeed released later in the summer, and that it's not a coincidence that (then-candidate) Trump asked Russia to release Clinton's emails very shortly after the meeting between the Kremlin-connected Lawyer and Manafort/Kushner/Donald Trump Jr. And maybe it isn't a coincidence, but it seems perfectly possible to me that it IS a coincidence.\\n\\n4. Did you ignore evidence that Putin wasn't behind the DNC hack? Not to my knowledge. The sources I link to above are very convincing. I think it's important to remember here that there is VERY BROAD CONSENSUS across political parties among U.S. leaders that the Russian government was behind the DNC hack, as well as the other facets of their campaign to influence the election. They've seen information that we don't have, and they ALL consider it to be credible. If there were more Republicans saying, Wait a minute, as was the case with Democrats and the intelligence about WMD in Iraq, I'd be more hesitant. As it is, I think it's just a very inconvenient fact for a lot of people's political narratives that Putin decided whose emails we got to read in the runup to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.\\n\\n5. Why didn't you mention Carter Page or Roger Stone or et cetera? Because the video was already nine minutes long, and also because most of the people you're asking about left Trump's official campaign relatively early on. It's important to remember that these days a LOT of U.S. political consultants do business abroad. I don't think in and of itself that should be a red flag.\\n\\n6. John Podesta was the chairman of Clinton's campaign, not of the DNC. MY MISTAKE.\\n\\n7. Why didn't you talk about Trump drafting the untrue initial press release for Donald Trump Jr? There's reporting about this here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/us/politics/trump-was-involved-in-drafting-sons-statement-aide-confirms.html Some people think this is a crime (likely obstruction of justice), but it seems a stretch to me. They made the meeting to be about adoption; it's perfectly possible that adoption was mentioned. That doesn't strike me as a likely crime. If we put every politician or businessperson in prison who massaged the truth in a press release, our incarceration rate would be very high, indeed. \\n\\nI'll add more answers (and corrections, I'm sure) as they come in. Thanks for watching. -John",1449,154

Why leave out favors were going to her (playing both hands isn't uncommon and is safe).\\nAlso he kinda really kept out how most people in the cyber security world said none of the evidence shown the DNC was hacked by Russia. The guy's password was password, his IT staff told him that wasn't a real e-mail, and he still went through it. If you actually read their public notes, the security agencies say Russia did it because they put propaganda on RT not dealing with the hack. (Why is it that people forget that these law makers are also not tech savvy by any degree?)\\nLastly, he didn't mention basically everyone messes with everyone's elections. Obama even openly admitted he was messing with them overseas.There isn't a single law against 1 country advertising and pushing for who they like. Like as long as gifts aren't given (look at Clinton and she broken this majorly so), and the written laws aren't broken. There is always someone trying to push who they like in office.\\n*Oh and did everyone forget that Clinton said she wanted to go to war with Russia? She literally said war brings people together.* And it isn't like it's all that hard to find all the dirt on her. Russia paying $100k to FB which gets literally billions in ads isn't jack. People didn't want her for many reasons. Her only reason to run was it was her time. She wanting to go to war with Russia by controlling the air space over Syria (even Sanders told her that was stupid). He not really pushing for more jobs and acting like no one was financially hurting. The mountains of evidence of her corruption and shady dealings. Her being super unstable emotionally. *Hell, she is still blaming everyone but herself. Do you really want someone like that for the leader of the world?*\\n*If she didn't try her corrupt dealings with Sanders then he most likely would've won. He even won the primaries, but the DNC hacks shown she screwed with that. Why isn't she in jail yet?*",0,0

I use the Beta Clarifying cleanser, the glyco-solution (they have 5, 10, and 15% so depending on how sensitive your skin is, I started with the lowest) the Vita C serum and the oil free moisturizer. I use these all twice a day and in about 2-3 months, my skin was clear. My clogged pores either came to a head or just disappeared! I love your channel and you and I hope this helps!!! 💜💜💜💜",0,0

IqLi6Pn_rVo,I have seen on your sc that you have some deer friends. I have been doing research on current health issues and Lymes disease is scary. It is transmitted via a tick which lives on deer in the Northern East cost. Symptoms are flu-like symptoms and only 60-70% get a rash. If it is not caught in early stages it can become life-threatening. It may be a good idea to get tested or wear tick repellant. I just wanted to make you aware of the danger. Please be safe.,0,0

qdWUQGHtyPk,"On the whole standing for the national anthem thing, I feel like Trump is really driving a hyper-nationalist narrative.  You respect the flag or you're fired.  It is divisive, and I think Phil hit on a great point, the kneeling was in protest of social issues originally (specifically around policing).  I'm of the same mindset as a certain German scientist who once said, Nationalism is an infantile disease, it's the measles of humanity.  It seems the president is using his Nationalist rhetoric to create in-groups and out-groups, those who agree with or support the players, and those who do not.  Sad.",0,0

qdWUQGHtyPk,"This comment might be long and probably won't be featured on the Friday show, but this has been dawning on my mind and needed to get it out. Hopefully y'all who do read it keep it civil and give your input.\\n\\nThis is my opinion when it comes to the whole flag debate. Personally I will stand for the anthem because it shows some kind of respect for the country, even though I'm not that patriotic, but I won't condemn people who kneel during the anthem because one it's their right to just like it's mine to stand. Also because from what I heard and seen it doesn't look like they're doing this to disrespect the flag, anthem or vets but more for social injustice. Do I think it got the message out? Most likely not because everyone is shouting at everyone about what's right and what's wrong and not having a civil conversation. It's just I'm right and you're wrong mentality with most of the people debating this. Could it have been done at a better time instead of during the national anthem? Probably. Because the players and the NFL are getting really bad publicity for it, but like they bad publicity is good publicity because it shined light on them, just probably not the way they wanted. But on the flip side it seems like people of color whenever they do protest peacefully it doesn't get attention or there are more complaints about why are they protesting? There's nothing to protest about so I can see why the NFL players may have protested like this. Also to add another opinion here, I don't think the national anthem should be played at sporting events. It kinda feels like forced patriotism. There are plenty of other days in the year where I can be patriotic if I feel like it. When I go to a game I'm not there to be patriotic. I'm there to watch players play the game and have fun. Though the exception to that is if the game calls on one of those patriotic day then that's fine to be patriotic. But that's my two cents.",0,0

qdWUQGHtyPk,"I will always stand and respect our flag and anthem, but I I respect the right of other not to. However, what many are forgetting is that the players are employees.

And we'll judge you, not for the act of protesting, but for your reason for protesting. If you're protestations are deemed legitimate you'll be praised, if not you'll be condemned. But evidently I was wrong. No one even seems to care about what's being protested, but rather how they're protesting. If you disagree with what they're protesting -- I know I do: Police malfeasance is a national issue, not a racial one -- then criticize their reason for protesting.

Please stop using all Veterans to bolster your argument, no matter the side.\\n\\nAs for my opinion on the matter. A protest needs to be uncomfortable and inconvenient. If it’s not one of these two things it can be ignored and a protest that can be ignored isn’t effective. \\n\\nFor decades Pro Athletes have been role models for kids. It’s not the same as another job. Someone working as a Pipe Fitter doesn’t have the same social impact on youth as someone who is on TV every week. That’s just the way it is. The NFL has awards for outreach into communities, this is something they want. To say that Athlete’s shouldn’t be political is to complete ignore their social importance to society.\\n\\nThe flag means more than just a representation of the military. The flag represents everything about this country, it’s history, the wars it’s fought, the economic depressions we’ve overcome, the scientific advancements we’ve achieved, and the social and economic adversities we still face today.

Or better yet, in Charlotte where a 'black' suspect who won't drop his weapon is shot by a 'black' cop who works for a 'black' police chief who works for a 'black' mayor naturally led to race riots with looting, destruction of property and beating up of whites?  That was special (MLK would have been truly ashamed).\\n\\nBut that's what happens when you automatically assume that if something bad happens to a black suspect that there must not only be wrong-doing, but it 'must' have been racially motivated (that means police vs 'citizen' becomes null and void and blacks have to be treated special?).  And never mind that blacks are 3 times more likely per capita to commit felonies.\\n\\nThe sad part is that had the suspects been other than black, the stories would have never even made it past their local news!!!\\n\\nAnd has anyone noticed that BLM hasn't even found a reason to misbehave (even by their lofty standards) for over a year now (Charlotte, with a change in the White House since)?

It does make a good point though for 'racial inequality'.  Speaking of equality, does mean blacks are going to raise their high school graduation rate or cut their crime rate by two thirds?  \\n\\nThat flag by the way, also represents the 100's of thousands of Union Soldiers (Northern Republicans) that died fighting to free the slaves from Southern Democrats.

qdWUQGHtyPk,"This is going to be long. I have served in the Military. I will always stand for the Anthem. Do I feel there is disrespect in the taking the knee protest... yes.

I may not agree with how they protest, but I do understand the initial reasoning of the protest. I do feel there could be other more beneficial ways to protest these injustices. I will not condemn though for their protest. I, much like any other personage that has served, swore an oath to uphold the constitution, and defend it. It is in The Oath of Enlistment. Although I have my personal feelings about this particular usage of taking the knee. I would also like to point out that there are several instances in history where taking a knee is considered a high form of respect. One would kneel before royalty. Getting knighted one would kneel. Kneeling was a form of showing fealty. Kneeling before a battle cross is an iconic form of remembrance, and respect for most of the people I served with. ( Battle Cross being a wooden cross grave marker usually, jammed into the ground boots, and dogtags hanging from it helmet on the top, and rifle leaning against it.) One of the biggest issues people do need to remember though with this protest, is that these protestor are protected by their rights from government persecution. That includes our President. He is at the top of our government. Also, a reminder is just because they're exercising their rights, does not make anyone else's usage of those same rights any less valid.

He was allowed to wear socks depicting police officers as pigs on the field. He was allowed to wear a t-shirt supporting Fidel Castro, and Malcolm X during a press conference. How can one protest the uncivil treatment of minorities while supporting a dictator who had a history of violating civil rights and the liberty of his people. Racism in Castro's Cuba toward Black people far outweighs anything you see in today's USA. Yet he was protesting the oppression of blacks and other minorities in this country.\\nThen there is the NFL. After the tragic murders of five Dallas police officers, the Dallas Cowboys asked the NFL if players could wear a decal on their helmets commemorating the officers’ sacrifice. In this case, the NFL did not support its players when they wanted to see change in society.

qdWUQGHtyPk,"Not gonna lie, I’m kind of disappointed a huge part of the #TakeAKnee story was omitted. I know it probably wasn’t on the radar since hockey isn’t very popular but it’s incredibly relevant to the story that was covered. The NHL is a predominately white league with approximately THIRTY black players. Having the Pittsburgh Penguins confirm they will visit the White House is very telling that they do not care about their POC and LGBTQ fans, despite saying “Hockey is for everyone.” Not only is that incredibly disheartening as a fan of the team and of hockey, it’s horrible timing. They released their statement on Sunday around the same time as the NFL protests were happening. Commentators from all over the league have said that their timing was horrendous, and that had they had a choice they wouldn’t go. It’s embarrassing and upsetting as a fan to know that the face of Pittsburgh’s franchise, of hockey itself, says he is EXCITED to meet with this president, despite being aware of our current social climate. I wish this could have touched on and hope that it wasn’t something that went ignored.",0,0

TO5cYWd12lQ,"Welcome to the PC master race. Monitors, depending on the budget, are tough. I'd say, for editing, the most important options are resolution and color recreation. Gaming monitors have amazing refresh rates and low input lag but tend to come with TN panels instead of IPS, which is no good for editing. I'd stay away unless they have an IPS panel. For a mouse, it depends lol. A wireless one that I would recommend for you would be the Logitech MX Master 2S. Otherwise, look at the features you want, and don't be afraid of a mouse because its labeled as a gaming mouse. Gotta get a mechanical keyboard too. Expensive, seriously, but so worth it in terms of durability alone. Then you need to look at the type of key switch. The most popular, and kind of default, type are Cherry MX switches. If you want a tactile feel and click on each keystroke, I recommend Cherry MX Blue switches. If you want that feel with a quieter click, I recommend the Cherry Mx Brown switches. If you want a smooth keystroke, the Cherry MX red are the ones. Logitech and Razer make their own key switches, but do tell you what type of Cherry MX switches they are comparable to.",0,0

ZYSjPZUqLdk,"CORRECTIONS AND Q'S A'ed:\\n1. NIXON WAS NEVER ACTUALLY IMPEACHED. He resigned. Articles of impeachment passed out of committee, but he resigned before the impeachment vote. MY MISTAKE.\\n\\n2. Why didn't you talk about Ukraine's support of Hillary Clinton? This is a good and interesting question. There is some evidence that Ukraine's government sought to influence the election for Clinton (although it was not nearly as extensive as the meddling by the government of Russia). But as I say in the video, benefiting from a propaganda campaign is not a crime, and no evidence has emerged that any Clinton staffers received or accepted any thing of value. So I didn't talk about it because it wasn't the topic of the video.\\n\\n3. Why didn't you talk about the incredibly coincidental timing of later in the summer and Trump asking Russia to release Clinton's 33,000 emails? Okay, so lots of people believe that it's not a coincidence that Donald Trump Jr. said later in the summer and then the DNC emails were indeed released later in the summer, and that it's not a coincidence that (then-candidate) Trump asked Russia to release Clinton's emails very shortly after the meeting between the Kremlin-connected Lawyer and Manafort/Kushner/Donald Trump Jr. And maybe it isn't a coincidence, but it seems perfectly possible to me that it IS a coincidence.\\n\\n4. Did you ignore evidence that Putin wasn't behind the DNC hack? Not to my knowledge. The sources I link to above are very convincing. I think it's important to remember here that there is VERY BROAD CONSENSUS across political parties among U.S. leaders that the Russian government was behind the DNC hack, as well as the other facets of their campaign to influence the election. They've seen information that we don't have, and they ALL consider it to be credible. If there were more Republicans saying, Wait a minute, as was the case with Democrats and the intelligence about WMD in Iraq, I'd be more hesitant. As it is, I think it's just a very inconvenient fact for a lot of people's political narratives that Putin decided whose emails we got to read in the runup to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.\\n\\n5. Why didn't you mention Carter Page or Roger Stone or et cetera? Because the video was already nine minutes long, and also because most of the people you're asking about left Trump's official campaign relatively early on. It's important to remember that these days a LOT of U.S. political consultants do business abroad. I don't think in and of itself that should be a red flag.\\n\\n6. John Podesta was the chairman of Clinton's campaign, not of the DNC. MY MISTAKE.\\n\\n7. Why didn't you talk about Trump drafting the untrue initial press release for Donald Trump Jr? There's reporting about this here: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/us/politics/trump-was-involved-in-drafting-sons-statement-aide-confirms.html Some people think this is a crime (likely obstruction of justice), but it seems a stretch to me. They made the meeting to be about adoption; it's perfectly possible that adoption was mentioned. That doesn't strike me as a likely crime. If we put every politician or businessperson in prison who massaged the truth in a press release, our incarceration rate would be very high, indeed. \\n\\nI'll add more answers (and corrections, I'm sure) as they come in. Thanks for watching. -John",1519,161

ZYSjPZUqLdk,"As an ex nerdfighter and libertarian, I think this is very well done and pretty fair, but I would add 2 points to the conversion. \\n\\n1) While I despise Trumps inability to recognize he's the POTUS and with that his opinions/desires carry more weight, I believe that much like saying NFL players should be fired, him asking Comey to drop the case is exactly that, him, as a person, asking. I realize he can't do that and agree that he can't do that, but I don't think his motives are the same level of malice. Claiming he fired Comey to stop an investigation is asinine, firing a director doesn't mean the whole organizations direction changes. \\n\\n2) I hate when Trump does it just like I hated it when Obama did it. Look it up, Obama asked Putin for political grace until after his 2012 election, basically changing foreign policy just to get re-elected. It is whataboutism, but it's important to realize it's more the office than the individual. \\n\\nAlso, I could be wrong, but I believe the Russians attempted to hack the GOP servers but republican security was actually decent.",0,0
ZYSjPZUqLdk,"Its very interesting seeing what comes next out of this whole Russian conspiracy.  The more we find out the less compelling the case.

Why leave out favors were going to her (playing both hands isn't uncommon and is safe).\\nAlso he kinda really kept out how most people in the cyber security world said none of the evidence shown the DNC was hacked by Russia. The guy's password was password, his IT staff told him that wasn't a real e-mail, and he still went through it. If you actually read their public notes, the security agencies say Russia did it because they put propaganda on RT not dealing with the hack. (Why is it that people forget that these law makers are also not tech savvy by any degree?)\\nLastly, he didn't mention basically everyone messes with everyone's elections. Obama even openly admitted he was messing with them overseas.There isn't a single law against 1 country advertising and pushing for who they like. Like as long as gifts aren't given (look at Clinton and she broken this majorly so), and the written laws aren't broken. There is always someone trying to push who they like in office.\\n*Oh and did everyone forget that Clinton said she wanted to go to war with Russia? She literally said war brings people together.* And it isn't like it's all that hard to find all the dirt on her. Russia paying $100k to FB which gets literally billions in ads isn't jack. People didn't want her for many reasons. Her only reason to run was it was her time. She wanting to go to war with Russia by controlling the air space over Syria (even Sanders told her that was stupid). He not really pushing for more jobs and acting like no one was financially hurting. The mountains of evidence of her corruption and shady dealings. Her being super unstable emotionally. *Hell, she is still blaming everyone but herself. Do you really want someone like that for the leader of the world?*\\n*If she didn't try her corrupt dealings with Sanders then he most likely would've won.

ZYSjPZUqLdk,"With respect to the claims about Michael Flynn:\\nIn 2015, Flynn received about $45,000 for attending Russian state TV network RT’s gala dinner in Moscow, where he sat next to Russian president Vladimir Putin. He also received $530,000 for consulting work that likely benefited the Turkish government while working as a top adviser to Trump’s presidential campaign.\\nSource: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/apr/25/michael-flynn-russia-payment-house-panel-investigation\\n\\nSo this is 'Russian influence on the election', via Flynn?  Or is Flynn supposedly working on behalf of Putin, and not, for example, Erdogan?\\n\\nI guess that 'Turkey hacked our elections!' wouldn't sell as well, and doesn't meet propaganda goals.\\n\\n(This example is a good indicator of the quality of this Putin-Trump nonsense.  It isn't quite lies -- mostly -- but it is incredibly distorted in a deliberate fashion to misrepresent the full truth.  One result is you make allies of idiot Trump supporters -- oh, and some racists who aren't technically idiots, I guess -- and those who oppose Trump but are more concerned about the 'Trump derangement syndrome' that leads to this insanity.)",0,2

qdWUQGHtyPk,"I’ve given this a decent amount of thought. My social media feeds have been a slew of varying opinions on this topic. To denounce kneeling during the National Anthem is disrespectful to Veterans I think is an over generalization of what a Veteran is. We come from different backgrounds, socially, economically, and racially. “Veterans” isn’t a blanket statement that covers some autonomous thinking entity. Some Vets support the kneeling, some don’t. Please stop using all Veterans to bolster your argument, no matter the side.\\n\\nAs for my opinion on the matter. A protest needs to be uncomfortable and inconvenient. If it’s not one of these two things it can be ignored and a protest that can be ignored isn’t effective. \\n\\nFor decades Pro Athletes have been role models for kids. It’s not the same as another job. Someone working as a Pipe Fitter doesn’t have the same social impact on youth as someone who is on TV every week. That’s just the way it is. The NFL has awards for outreach into communities, this is something they want. To say that Athlete’s shouldn’t be political is to complete ignore their social importance to society.\\n\\nThe flag means more than just a representation of the military. The flag represents everything about this country, it’s history, the wars it’s fought, the economic depressions we’ve overcome, the scientific advancements we’ve achieved, and the social and economic adversities we still face today. To sum the flag up into just one of these causes is to ignore everything else about the country. I feel that goes for both sides of this argument.",0,0

Passed that how many time have you been at a bar or a party at house and seen ppl talking and not removing hat's during the anthem and nothing get said to them so because these athletes make millions of dollars they get treated differently.

qdWUQGHtyPk,"Part of what has made the United States great is the fact that people are allowed to floss their ass with the flag in protest: They're allowed to demean our symbols.

And we'll judge you, not for the act of protesting, but for your reason for protesting. If you're protestations are deemed legitimate you'll be praised, if not you'll be condemned. But evidently I was wrong. No one even seems to care about what's being protested, but rather how they're protesting. If you disagree with what they're protesting -- I know I do: Police malfeasance is a national issue, not a racial one -- then criticize their reason for protesting.

If he is successful at dividing Americans in the arena of what is probably America's greatest religion - sports - than we are one step closer to loosing this nation.\\nI don't know who Trump is doing this for - whether he is trying to bring back the glory of the Confederacy and have it finally secede from the Union, or if he is a secret Nazi, or if he is a Russian puppet - but every single thing he does is one step closer to the end of this fucking country.",0,0

I was thought as an outsider to have respect the flag which I agree, but most of the time some of those people showed little to no respect towards who I am. Yes I am an immigrant but I have nothing but love and respect towards my country of origin and the United states and I side with Kaepernick this time. Until we fix all the inequality in this country I wouldn't stand for the anthem either because I don't feel free and sometimes even represented well with current government.",0,0
qdWUQGHtyPk,"People might be more inclined to support the players if they werent such HUGE hypocrits! For decades police turned a blind eye to crimes committed by NFL players. Crimes like sexual abuse, rape, DWI, beating their wives (OJ is a good example here) and they, the players, didnt seem to have a problem with the police then! NFL players are dispropotionately arrested on domestic abuse, rape, sexual abuse, and a plethora of other charges, than the rest of the population. Shouldnt they clean their own house before critisizing others dirty houses?They are protesting what is also a false narrative as the stats just dont support what they claim to be protesting. Instead of protesting the problem 672 steps down the line how about protesting the fact that 6% of the population commits over 50% of violent crimes? How about prostesting the black on black violence and murder rate? How about the black abortion rate? Where are all the youth centers and mentor programs their millions of dollars could build and fund? How many black youths do they work with, and i dont just mean throwing money at the problem.Sure, they have a right to protest but protesting the National Anthem/Flag because of police brutality is like protesting God and the faithful because a bunch of priests are pedophiles.Also, I have the right to protest too but if I did it at my job I would be FIRED! There is a time and a place and while you are being paid millions to play a game is not the time or place to stick your middle finger up to people paying you to PLAY! If this really means that much to them they should address the problems directly, to the people being affected, not just tar every single police officer in the country.I get why they dont do that....because only having a few cases here or there doesnt get them near the attention that doing it during a nationally televised game does.They are presenting it like every police force has every other officer only targeting black people and that is as far from the truth and as false/misleading as the Hands up, dont shoot false, made up narrative that was spun by MSM.",1,0
qdWUQGHtyPk,"My brother is Army. Brother in law, Airforce. Husband... my entire world... Navy...\\nStanding for the anthem, respecting the flag, is for those lost in the fight for freedom. Just because you CAN do something, doesnt mean you SHOULD. My husband hates what is happening. He thinks it is absolutely disgusting. He said he doesnt want your respect, but the fallen MORE than deserve it. \\nKneeling is a slap in the face to those lost. And a slap in the face to the families of those lost.\\nThey are multi millionaires. Their fanbases are enormous. There are soooo many different ways they could make their point known, without disrespecting the fallen.\\nMy husband isnt an NFL fan, but i WAS. i refuse to give them anymore of my time or money, because they arent deserving of it.\\nThese celebrities forget that the only value they hold to the vast majority of people ends the second they no longer entertain us. Or rather, the second them entertaining us comes at too great of a cost, or too big of an inconvenience.\\nTrump likes to take things way too far, every chance he gets. This situation is no exception. I can say though that i agree with the call for a boycott.\\nJust as they have the right to be disrespectful little shits to the men and woman who died for that right... we have the right to stand against their disgusting disrespect, and take away the one thing that matters most to them, their money.\\nIf you continue to watch nfl, that is your decision and your right.

Thats a crappy right in the middle of the road opinion you got, trying not to offend anybody and be 50/50 its everybody's fault BS. \\nDid anybody (anybody) asked Kaepernick when he planned to stop protesting? What was his criterias? When zero minority is oppressed in this country? Was he planning to protest the National Anthem until the end of his f*cking career? \\nPhil, enough. \\nA f*cking football game isnt the place to protest the flag and the National Anthem because you're not happy about something. \\nYou can protest before the game, after the game, publicly, privately, online, whatever. \\nBut the football fans, who are held hostages and are forced to watch you also have the right to walk away. \\nAnd thats what they're doing. \\nThe players didn't understand that its not the NFL that pays their huge salaries. \\nIts the fans. \\nIts the eyeballs in front of the screens. \\nThese players didn't think this thing through.",0,0

qdWUQGHtyPk,"On the whole standing for the national anthem thing, I feel like Trump is really driving a hyper-nationalist narrative.  You respect the flag or you're fired.  It is divisive, and I think Phil hit on a great point, the kneeling was in protest of social issues originally (specifically around policing).  I'm of the same mindset as a certain German scientist who once said, Nationalism is an infantile disease, it's the measles of humanity.  It seems the president is using his Nationalist rhetoric to create in-groups and out-groups, those who agree with or support the players, and those who do not.  Sad.",0,0

qdWUQGHtyPk,"This comment might be long and probably won't be featured on the Friday show, but this has been dawning on my mind and needed to get it out. Hopefully y'all who do read it keep it civil and give your input.\\n\\nThis is my opinion when it comes to the whole flag debate. Personally I will stand for the anthem because it shows some kind of respect for the country, even though I'm not that patriotic, but I won't condemn people who kneel during the anthem because one it's their right to just like it's mine to stand. Also because from what I heard and seen it doesn't look like they're doing this to disrespect the flag, anthem or vets but more for social injustice. Do I think it got the message out? Most likely not because everyone is shouting at everyone about what's right and what's wrong and not having a civil conversation. It's just I'm right and you're wrong mentality with most of the people debating this. Could it have been done at a better time instead of during the national anthem? Probably. Because the players and the NFL are getting really bad publicity for it, but like they bad publicity is good publicity because it shined light on them, just probably not the way they wanted. But on the flip side it seems like people of color whenever they do protest peacefully it doesn't get attention or there are more complaints about why are they protesting? There's nothing to protest about so I can see why the NFL players may have protested like this. Also to add another opinion here, I don't think the national anthem should be played at sporting events. It kinda feels like forced patriotism. There are plenty of other days in the year where I can be patriotic if I feel like it. When I go to a game I'm not there to be patriotic. I'm there to watch players play the game and have fun. Though the exception to that is if the game calls on one of those patriotic day then that's fine to be patriotic. But that's my two cents.",0,0
qdWUQGHtyPk,"Being patriotic is a great way to become a racist. The flag is a piece of cloth. We don't need these things.\\n\\nBut someone who'd disrespect their own country in the way the NFL did don't sound to me like they have anyone's best interests at heart. It's those who appreciate America who can do the most good making it better. Anti-American actions like taking a knee only give support to those who want to see America toppled. Stand with America, and see it heal instead. You have to care about your country to mend it.\\n\\nI say this as an Englishman who can see what a fucked up place America is.

qdWUQGHtyPk,"I'd also like to add that most players are not trying to disrespect the anthem. Kneeling before it is a mode of protest.

I support soldiers and vets, and not superficially so... respecting the flag is stupid, when so many neglect the people to whom you say the honor is given.

As an African America, I find it disingenuous to say that people fighting overseas in 3rd world countries has improved my rights as an American citizen, with so many soldiers with my skin tone coming back over here to witness the realities of this county.  We have martyrs of civil liberties and rights who did not fight in any war, who gave their lives to change things.

zrOHeEA14kQ,"Hi, My name is PAUL HEINZ and i just want to share my experience with everyone. I have being hearing about this blank ATM card for a while and i never really paid any interest to it because of my doubts. Until one day i discovered a hacking guy called JOSSY . he is really good at what he is doing. Back to the point, I inquired about The Blank ATM Card. If it works or even Exist. They told me Yes and that its a card programmed for random money withdraws without being noticed and can also be used for free online purchases of any kind. This was shocking and i still had my doubts. Then i gave it a try and asked for the card and agreed to their terms and conditions.. Four days later i received my card and tried with the closest ATM machine close to me, to my greatest surprise It worked like magic. I was able to withdraw up to $3000 . This was unbelievable and the happiest day of my life. So far i have being able to withdraw up to $48000 without any stress of being caught. there is no ATM MACHINES this BLANK ATM CARD CANNOT penetrate into it because it have been programmed with various tools and software. it also has a technique that makes it impossible for the CCTV to detect you i don’t know why i am posting this here, i just felt this might help those of us in need of financial stability. blank ATM has really change my life.

Whether you believe or not does not change the fact that The One and Only Jesus Christ is on his way....shortly. Like days. How many? Not sure. But my spirit feels it. This world is messed up. You must admit that. Its all a lie...all the things you think make you happy are lies. The devil hates you and is laughing at you. Jesus loves you. He died for you and the entire world. Even if you don't  love him. He is waiting for you to receive him in your heart. If you are ready to receive Jesus into your heart pray this prayer before it's too late. This is an urgent warning. Pray: Jesus I am a sinner, I believe you died on the cross for me and my sins and rose from the dead. Please forgive me of all my sins I am repenting now and I ask you to enter my heart right now. Change me. I want to make you happy. I want to be happy and go to heaven. I do not want to be stuck in the tribulation. Help me to open my spiritual eyes and ears before you get here. I ask this in Jesus name Amen! \\n\\nIf you just prayed this prayer welcome to the family! You made the most important decision of your life right now. Don't stop praying and remember a prayer can be a simple as Jesus, help me!  now get a bible or an app and read about revelation. And read Matthew and John chapters. For a start. I pray you made the right decision and prayed that prayer. See you in heaven!💛💛😘👏👍😊 \\n\\nTwitter: @YoNaturefreek",0,0

TO5cYWd12lQ,"Bying a Keyboard and Mouse is a huge preference. It depends upon what you're doing exactly. \\nHere are few examples.\\nMechanical keys - LOUD, like really LOUD, but sturdy and last longer. Keys able to be changed/replaced easily. Popular among gamers who bash buttons. Always expensive due to the materials used. A bit overpriced, too! Go for either Razer of Corsair ones.\\n\\nMembrane based keyboard - Different variations to choose from. Slightly loud, but not as much as mechanical ones. Most common ones used worldwide for typing and offices. Choosing one is simply a matter of search what's available. \\n\\nScissor-based keyboards - The most silent ones out there. Notable mention are Natec Genesys RX22 and Red Dragon Karura K502. Very silent, my personal favorites, very cheap, too! They're good for both gaming and typing alike. Think >laptop buttons< type. \\n\\nThere are membrane x mechanical keyboards, but I think that's just stupid. I choose keyboards based on their sound since I prefer things to be kind of silent due to the music I listen to, and I think that functionality is far better than elegance/sturdiness of a keyboard. \\n\\nAs for the MICE you want to choose - think SENSORS. Find the best optical sensors and sticks with them. I personally use Razer DeathAdder Elite and it's an amazing MICE. \\nYou want to pick a MICE that suits your HAND LENGTH and feels comfortable to work with.

TO5cYWd12lQ,"Keyboard - obviously mechanical. I'd personally recommend the WASD V2. I got one over a year ago, and it has held up very well. It's a bit pricier than a lot of other mechanical keyboards, but it's built really well, has an elegant and minimalist look, and has insane customization from the factory. You can easily match your purple / white / black aesthetic and customize the legends. (Although it might have a slightly different shade of purple.) You've also got tons of switch options, but you'll probably want to look mostly at the Cherry MX Brown, Blue, or Clear switches.\\n\\nMouse - I use the Logitech G602. It's pretty handy since it has 6 thumb buttons with per-application customization. The MX Master is also really good and comfortable, more designed for general productivity than gaming.\\n\\nMonitor - IDK, probably a nice ultrawide or 4K IPS panel or something. My monitors are trash, so you probably don't want to take advice from me ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",0,0

TO5cYWd12lQ,"Sara, make sure you remove the plastic from the case window. The cooling inside your pc won't really be affected by it, it just looks better.\\n\\nAs for suggestions:\\nI'd definitely go with the Logitech MX Master for the mouse. It has many features that can be used for editing purposes, and can go wireless so it would work with your macs as well.\\nI heavily reccomend Corsair keyboards. They're mechanical and come with different switches which change the force needed for a keypress to register, as well as the sound they make. The one you were using with Austin in the video is a Corsair keyboard. They also have RGB backlighting, which PC gamers love.",0,0

I'm not sure how big you want the monitor to be, personally, i would go from anywhere from 29 to 34 (when you would take an ultra wide).

csrYDgBF2nI,"Big win, I like it... but there remain massive issues with the Hawks' offensive line, despite the gaudy numbers from this game. The awakening Rams front seven, which utterly dominated the Cowboys' vaunted O-line in the second half, holds a decisive talent advantage over Cable's guys, and should shred them next week. Ifedi is a near constant liability in the passing game, and Seattle is lucky he's been getting away with holding as much as he has. I had low expectations for Joeckel, and he's still been a disappointment. Odhiambo has a guard's body, and I don't know how much more the team can keep putting up with his predictable turnstile tendencies before they have to replace him with a proper tackle. Tobin may be the better option at this point, in which case it's going to be a long season. I don't see how Russell survives the experience for all 16 games.",0,0

You must admit that. Its all a lie...all the things you think make you happy are lies. The devil hates you and is laughing at you. Jesus loves you. He died for you and the entire world. Even if you don't  love him. He is waiting for you to receive him in your heart. If you are ready to receive Jesus into your heart pray this prayer before it's too late. This is an urgent warning. Pray: Jesus I am a sinner, I believe you died on the cross for me and my sins and rose from the dead. Please forgive me of all my sins I am repenting now and I ask you to enter my heart right now. Change me. I want to make you happy. I want to be happy and go to heaven. I do not want to be stuck in the tribulation. Help me to open my spiritual eyes and ears before you get here. I ask this in Jesus name Amen! \\n\\nIf you just prayed this prayer welcome to the family! You made the most important decision of your life right now. Don't stop praying and remember a prayer can be a simple as Jesus, help me!  now get a bible or an app and read about revelation. And read Matthew and John chapters. For a start.

TO5cYWd12lQ,Monitor Question: Stick with IPS panel for the accurate color. Also don't go any smaller than 27 and if you can find a 100Hz monitor that would be key. Or an IPS Ultra Wide IPS panel with a 3840X1440. Personally I trust Dell monitors and so far I've had good luck with them. my oldest Dell 1080P was bought back in 2006 and it's still working today and I like their contrast ratio and brightness. Just set them both to 100 and good to go. Blacks are black and whites are bright. Also if you don't want a Dell Monitor you can always look into a Samsung or LG or even ASUS. They all make Ultra Wide and once you go there you will never want to go back to 16:9 ratio again.,0,0

Get an AIO(All in one) liquid cooler for you PC to replace the big heat sync with the brown fans. You have a nice looking case and that cooler for the cpu just ruins the build aesthetic. \\n2. Check out cable mod to see if you can get some white and purple cables for your build instead of the plain black ones. Again, aesthetics. :D \\n3. Check out the MX Master mouse.

TaxAsHhex10,"Barack Obama is the biggest coward to have ever walked through the White House as president. He had 8 years to address gun violence in this country. Not only nationwide but in his home state of Illinois. In Chicago thousands of people are shot every year, Men women and children, majority of those people black. Now you can blame the guns or the culture or whatever you want to blame. But the fact of the matter is Chicago is plagued with crime and murder, and for 8 years the first black president, who is FROM Chicago, stood by and watched. Yes,what happened in Las Vegas is a terrible tragedy. And yes he should not have been able to legally purchase those weapons, no matter how you look at the facts, he acquired those weapons legally and made modifications to turn them into mass murder machines. But to now say that trump is a coward if he doesn't do anything is ridiculous. The fact is, if liberals like sadiq khan continue to say that terror is part of living in a large city, then conservatives will continue to say that guns aren't the problem, the user is. If we want to get anything done we have to go at it with facts and without emotion. Because we cannot make rational decisions while acting under emotion.",0,0

But it is not the right thing to do *now*, today, or even next week, or month, in the emotionally fraught aftermath of the tragedy. We need to be courageous and *wait*, and do nothing, until we’ve cared for the hurt, and calmed our minds, and are able to face what is a tough question calmly, and with the full force of our intellect. If we don’t...well put it this way: we already have someone (of significant power) who is running rough-shod over logic, evidence, and the more or less formal processes we have built to amplify those useful things, and is instead letting his emotion and ego and desire for approval to lead/drag us along a dark path.

It's called Due Process which is part of the 5A which happens to also be in the Constitution. Colbert has no problem eschewing the 5A to get rid of the 2A. I bet Colbert would throw a fit if a President wrote an Executive Order denying him his 1A if he wanted his son to help him deposit his checks, help pay bills, etc. Just because someone has poor vision and would like help paying bills, does not make them mentally incompetent. That falls way short of adjudication. If you want to change the Constitution, go for it, but go about it the right way.

Even if you don't  love him. He is waiting for you to receive him in your heart. If you are ready to receive Jesus into your heart pray this prayer before it's too late. This is an urgent warning. Pray: Jesus I am a sinner, I believe you died on the cross for me and my sins and rose from the dead. Please forgive me of all my sins I am repenting now and I ask you to enter my heart right now. Change me. I want to make you happy. I want to be happy and go to heaven. I do not want to be stuck in the tribulation. Help me to open my spiritual eyes and ears before you get here. I ask this in Jesus name Amen! \\n\\nIf you just prayed this prayer welcome to the family! You made the most important decision of your life right now. Don't stop praying and remember a prayer can be a simple as Jesus, help me!  now get a bible or an app and read about revelation. And read Matthew and John chapters. For a start. I pray you made the right decision and prayed that prayer. See you in heaven!💛💛😘👏👍😊 \\n\\nTwitter: @YoNaturefreek",0,0

We all go through so much and seeing someone that looks like me reaffirming these emotions, that I too find myself going through, makes me feel that I'm not alone. Thx Tamar.",0,0

Their roles in history/their church history. See what standards they hold themselves to and try to do the same with your families for a week. Look at the differences in between them and America's people today. Do a myth busters over rumors about the church. This isn't me trying to convert you through the comment section, this is a fellow nerd-fighter hoping that you can learn about them and through you others can learn about them. What's their cause? What do they believe in? A portion of people's ignorance about them can be cleared up through you. Two great sources for learning are  https://www.lds.org/?lang=eng and The Gospel Library app. These people are good with wonderful charities to help/serve and they shouldn't be persecuted so much for a lack of understanding.

csrYDgBF2nI,"Big win, I like it... but there remain massive issues with the Hawks' offensive line, despite the gaudy numbers from this game. The awakening Rams front seven, which utterly dominated the Cowboys' vaunted O-line in the second half, holds a decisive talent advantage over Cable's guys, and should shred them next week. Ifedi is a near constant liability in the passing game, and Seattle is lucky he's been getting away with holding as much as he has. I had low expectations for Joeckel, and he's still been a disappointment. Odhiambo has a guard's body, and I don't know how much more the team can keep putting up with his predictable turnstile tendencies before they have to replace him with a proper tackle. Tobin may be the better option at this point, in which case it's going to be a long season. I don't see how Russell survives the experience for all 16 games.",0,0

It was the first thing to go when I started down a path of depression and isolation, books did not transport me to new lands. My depression coincided with the rise in dystopia fiction, so despite being raised with Harry Potter and Narnia, my world felt dismal. As if the words I was flooded with defined the whole of literary achievement. I read classics to stall my distaste for reading, and nothing worked. Books can no longer hold my attention, because I can only assume the worst, which ruins the surprise or in the end I am disappointed with the empty feeling of a happy ending.

I don't usually read poetry, and I won't lie and say that I understood the meaning of every poem he read, but I was enthralled during the entire reading. What astonished me the most about Kaveh was his eloquence, and his kindness.

22tF3y_epZs,"Hank and John, \\n\\n     I have a challenge for you. John, I know you love learning about other religions. I would love to see the two of you learn about the LDS church. Their roles in history/their church history. See what standards they hold themselves to and try to do the same with your families for a week. Look at the differences in between them and America's people today. Do a myth busters over rumors about the church. This isn't me trying to convert you through the comment section, this is a fellow nerd-fighter hoping that you can learn about them and through you others can learn about them. What's their cause? What do they believe in? A portion of people's ignorance about them can be cleared up through you. Two great sources for learning are  https://www.lds.org/?lang=eng and The Gospel Library app. These people are good with wonderful charities to help/serve and they shouldn't be persecuted so much for a lack of understanding. I think you will enjoy learning about them and from them.\\n                                                                                                                                           \\n                                                                                                                                                         -A concerned Nerd-fighter",0,0

The awakening Rams front seven, which utterly dominated the Cowboys' vaunted O-line in the second half, holds a decisive talent advantage over Cable's guys, and should shred them next week. Ifedi is a near constant liability in the passing game, and Seattle is lucky he's been getting away with holding as much as he has. I had low expectations for Joeckel, and he's still been a disappointment. Odhiambo has a guard's body, and I don't know how much more the team can keep putting up with his predictable turnstile tendencies before they have to replace him with a proper tackle. Tobin may be the better option at this point, in which case it's going to be a long season. I don't see how Russell survives the experience for all 16 games.",0,0

SGuUAtJ8yMM,"Much, much better than the previous 3 singles. Still scared for this album.",0,0
SGuUAtJ8yMM,This is a great Weez tune. Has a White vibe and Green vibe. Ranking high on my Weezer overplay list. The previous 3 were flimsy. This one's strong.,0,0
SGuUAtJ8yMM,"Wonderful verse, weak chorus and OK bridge.  6/10   I'd rather listen to the Green demo than this unfortunately.",0,0
SGuUAtJ8yMM,"This has a modern yet classic 60s pop sound. Between this and Weezer's recent use of the 50s chord progression in Go Away and Endless Bummer, they are bringing back great things. This really reminds me of Weezer combined with The Monkees new song She Makes Me Laugh (written by Rivers, of course.) Buying the new album at release.",0,0

SGuUAtJ8yMM,"This has a modern yet classic 60s pop sound. Between this and Weezer's recent use of the 50s chord progression in Go Away and Endless Bummer, they are bringing back great things. This really reminds me of Weezer combined with The Monkees new song She Makes Me Laugh (written by Rivers, of course.) Buying the new album at release.",0,0
SGuUAtJ8yMM,Weezer is probably my favorite active band. I've really liked the past 2 albums and the first 2 releases from the new album are good just not as good as most of their past work. This song however sucks.,0,0

URvC6T_xhE0,"Once upon a time, there lived a lion who was always bragging about his bravery, his strength, and his cunning. ‘There is no animal in the jungle who is braver than I,’ boasted the lion to all who would listen. ‘I am the biggest and the best, and I am afraid of no animal!’ he proclaimed.\\n\\nBut the lion was not being entirely truthful. He was very afraid of rats, and he did not want any of the other animals to know this in case they made fun of him.\\n\\nThere was also a little sheep who was very meek and quiet. The sheep did not boast or brag because the sheep did not consider himself to be brave or strong or cunning. Because the sheep was so quiet, the lion often picked on him and called him names. ‘You are a frightened little animal,’ goaded the lion. ‘You are too quiet and too timid. You should be more like me.’\\n\\nThe gentle sheep never answered this name calling, he simply went about his business in his usual manner. ‘I may be quiet,’ thought the sheep, ‘but at least I have friends and do not spend my time boasting about myself or judging others.’\\n\\nOne day, when the sheep was walking through the jungle, he heard the lion screaming at the top of his voice. ‘Help me! Help me!’\\n\\nThe little sheep ran in the direction of the lion’s desperate cries for help, until he found the mighty beast clinging to the lowest branch of a tree in a small clearing. ‘Help me, little sheep!’ pleaded the lion.\\n\\n￼‘What is wrong?’ asked the sheep as he looked about on the ground to see what had frightened the lion in such a way.\\n\\n‘Rats!’ exclaimed the lion, and with his tail he pointed towards the ground where there was a family of rats searching for food at the base of the tree.\\n\\n   The little sheep trotted up to the rats and gently pushed them away from the base of the tree. ‘Run along now,’ said the sheep, ‘You are scaring the lion.’\\n\\nAnd with that, the rats all scurried off into the jungle in search of more food.\\nWhen the lion was sure that the rats had gone, he dropped to the ground and tried his best to puff out his chest as if he had not been frightened at all. But the little sheep was not convinced by the lion’s bravado.\\n\\n‘Why is it that you are so scared of rats?’ asked the little sheep.\\n\\n‘They are slithery and slimy and dirty,’ said the lion.\\n\\n‘That is not true,’ protested the sheep. ‘How can you know what they are like if you have never spoken to them?’\\n\\n￼The lion thought about this for a while and eventually admitted that he had never spoken to the rats at all but had always been afraid of them. ‘You are right, little sheep,’ said the lion, ‘I decided that the rats were slithery and slimy and dirty, just as I had decided that you were timid and frightened, but it is not true. You are brave and strong, perhaps the bravest and strongest animal in the jungle!’\\n\\nThe sheep thanked the lion for his kind words but admitted that this was probably not true. The two of them laughed together and the sheep had to admit that it was very funny to see the mighty lion hanging from the tree looking so scared.\\n\\nFrom that day on, the sheep and the lion became very good friends, and the lion learned from the sheep that it was best never to judge another animal by the way they looked.       \\n\\nWhy can't we all just learn about whats going on before we judge",1,0

URvC6T_xhE0,"Who's the dangerous person; someone who has opinions progressives don't like or the person who assaults people who have opinions they don't like? It doesn't matter how rude someone is to you. In a free society, it's important that people are able to express whatever view they want regardless of how unpopular it is. Harassment is obviously a different issue and if someone is harassing someone else, there comes a point where light violence may be necessary. However, someone saying something rude or expressing an opinion is never harassment. Harassment is prolonged pursuant aggressive behavior aimed at upsetting the target. It only becomes harassment if the aggressor is resists the target's attempts to evade the prolonged aggressive behavior. Needless to say, randomly attacking someone the moment you hear them express an opinion you don't like is nothing more than violent bigotry and intolerance.",1,0

If you aren't experiencing something yourself, or have not studied a certain phenomena, don't comment on something you have no real knowledge, experience, or background in. And do not try to use religion as an excuse to hate other people.

6eHExt8C0qw,In retrospect.. The concept does sound obscene..,49,0
6eHExt8C0qw,"Why is this trailer so dramatic? It's a film about how a guy got inspired by his sexual relationship with two women and wrote a fetish fiction about a female superhero. It isn't inception, it's an art film that's trying to say something different about society's treatment of woman in positions of power, ironically choosing the one heroine who's kryptonite is men with whips. At least the concept is original, but I'm not completely sure what this movie is actually trying to say, if anything. Obviously a film doesn't need a message to drill into the viewers head as it can just tell a story, but now of all times? When the feminist movement is being popularized and slandered by the internet? Perhaps it's banking on the popularity of the previous Wonder Woman film, which itself is trying to bank on the feminist movement. (It wasn't even a good movie when being set to the standards of Homecoming and the Batman trilogy, at least to my personal preference.) Either way this won't change the way I look at Wonder Woman. The character has made a social impact sure, but not to the extent of Batman, Spiderman, or hell, even Deadpool. I reason this because she is exactly what she is, a superhero. Except she doesn't stand out or have something she does that seperates her from the especially large crowd of heroes. Spider-Man has to find a way to survive villains he used to know as friends, while balancing his home life and super life. He's just a kid. Batman is a tormented man who's past haunts him, so instead of moping he makes something of himself. He's just sad. Relatable characters. The only relatable thing about Wonder Woman is that she a woman. And that's what her market is based on. Sure she can battle Superman or some villain, and it'd look dope. She's just not an interesting enough character to be intested in. What is her weakness? What keeps her down everyday, just for her to overcome it? Being a woman. I can sure relate to that. Me myself can breath. I was born with it and many don't actually care if I do or don't, but now it's got me chained down. Not relatable. So why is this trailer glorifying the birth of this character? Sales most likely. Or the idea is simply artistic? It doesn't say anything, but it's never been put on screen before. And really at the end of the day, originality is what artists strive for. Thanks Wonder Woman.",29,3

6eHExt8C0qw,"Why is this trailer so dramatic? It's a film about how a guy got inspired by his sexual relationship with two women and wrote a fetish fiction about a female superhero. It isn't inception, it's an art film that's trying to say something different about society's treatment of woman in positions of power, ironically choosing the one heroine who's kryptonite is men with whips. At least the concept is original, but I'm not completely sure what this movie is actually trying to say, if anything. Obviously a film doesn't need a message to drill into the viewers head as it can just tell a story, but now of all times? When the feminist movement is being popularized and slandered by the internet? Perhaps it's banking on the popularity of the previous Wonder Woman film, which itself is trying to bank on the feminist movement. (It wasn't even a good movie when being set to the standards of Homecoming and the Batman trilogy, at least to my personal preference.) Either way this won't change the way I look at Wonder Woman. The character has made a social impact sure, but not to the extent of Batman, Spiderman, or hell, even Deadpool. I reason this because she is exactly what she is, a superhero. Except she doesn't stand out or have something she does that seperates her from the especially large crowd of heroes. Spider-Man has to find a way to survive villains he used to know as friends, while balancing his home life and super life. He's just a kid. Batman is a tormented man who's past haunts him, so instead of moping he makes something of himself. He's just sad. Relatable characters. The only relatable thing about Wonder Woman is that she a woman. And that's what her market is based on. Sure she can battle Superman or some villain, and it'd look dope. She's just not an interesting enough character to be intested in. What is her weakness? What keeps her down everyday, just for her to overcome it? Being a woman. I can sure relate to that. Me myself can breath. I was born with it and many don't actually care if I do or don't, but now it's got me chained down. Not relatable. So why is this trailer glorifying the birth of this character? Sales most likely. Or the idea is simply artistic? It doesn't say anything, but it's never been put on screen before. And really at the end of the day, originality is what artists strive for. Thanks Wonder Woman.",42,5

Figures are commonly quoted in basis points in finance, especially in fixed income markets.\\n\\nContents  [hide] \\n1 Definition\\n2 Permyriad\\n3 See also\\n4 References\\nDefinition[edit]\\n\\nVisualisation of 1%, 1‰, 1‱ and 1 ppm as the fraction of the red cube to its respective block (click for larger version)\\n1 basis point = (a difference of) 1 permyriad or one-hundredth of one percent\\n1 bp = (a difference of) 1‱ or 0.01% or 0.1‰ or 10−4 or  1⁄10000 or 0.0001\\n100 bp = (a difference of) 1% or 100‱\\nBasis points are used as a convenient unit of measurement in contexts where percentage differences of less than 1% are discussed. The most common example is interest rates, where differences in interest rates of less than 1% per year are usually meaningful to talk about. For example, a difference of 0.10 percentage points is equivalent to a change of 10 basis points (e.g., a 4.67% rate increases by 10 basis points to 4.77%). In other words, an increase of 100 basis points means a rise by 1 percentage point.\\n\\nLike percentage points, basis points avoid the ambiguity between relative and absolute discussions about interest rates by dealing only with the absolute change in numeric value of a rate. For example, if a report says there has been a 1% increase from a 10% interest rate, this could refer to an increase either from 10% to 10.1% (relative, 1% of 10%), or from 10% to 11% (absolute, 1% plus 10%). If, however, the report says there has been a 100 basis point increase from a 10% interest rate, then it is obvious that the interest rate of 10% has increased by 1.00% (the absolute change) to an 11% rate.\\n\\nIt is common practice in the financial industry to use basis points to denote a rate change in a financial instrument, or the difference (spread) between two interest rates, including the yields of fixed-income securities.\\n\\nSince certain loans and bonds may commonly be quoted in relation to some index or underlying security, they will often be quoted as a spread over (or under) the index. For example, a loan that bears interest of 0.50% per annum above the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is said to be 50 basis points over LIBOR, which is commonly expressed as L+50bps or simply L+50.\\n\\nThe term basis point has its origins in trading the basis or the spread between two interest rates. Since the basis is usually small, these are quoted multiplied up by 10,000, and hence a full point movement in the basis is a basis point. Contrast with pips in FX forward markets.\\n\\nExpense ratios of investment funds are often quoted in basis points.[4]\\n\\nPermyriad[edit]\\nA related concept is one part per ten thousand,  1⁄10,000. The same unit is also (rarely) called a permyriad, literally meaning for (every) myriad (ten thousand).[5][6] If used interchangeably, the permyriad is potentially confusing because an increase of one basis point to a 10 basis point value is generally understood to mean an increase to 11 basis points; not an increase of one part in ten thousand, meaning an increase to 10.001 basis points. This is akin to the difference between percentage and percentage point. A permyriad is written with U+2031 ‱ PER TEN THOUSAND SIGN (HTML &#8241;)[7] which looks like a percent sign (%) with three zeroes to the right of the slash. (It can be regarded as a stylized form of the four zeros in the denominator of  1⁄10,000, although it originates as a natural extension of the percent (%) and permille (‰) signs).\\n\\nSee also[edit]\\nPercentage point\\nPercent (%) 1 part in 100\\n#YIAYpoint",0,0

6eHExt8C0qw,In retrospect.. The concept does sound obscene..,71,0
6eHExt8C0qw,Hey look. It's a comic book fan talking to two-non-comic book fans.\n*Non-comic fans:* Pfft? Really?\n*Comic fan:* Yes. Really.,86,1
6eHExt8C0qw,"Why is this trailer so dramatic? It's a film about how a guy got inspired by his sexual relationship with two women and wrote a fetish fiction about a female superhero. It isn't inception, it's an art film that's trying to say something different about society's treatment of woman in positions of power, ironically choosing the one heroine who's kryptonite is men with whips. At least the concept is original, but I'm not completely sure what this movie is actually trying to say, if anything. Obviously a film doesn't need a message to drill into the viewers head as it can just tell a story, but now of all times? When the feminist movement is being popularized and slandered by the internet? Perhaps it's banking on the popularity of the previous Wonder Woman film, which itself is trying to bank on the feminist movement. (It wasn't even a good movie when being set to the standards of Homecoming and the Batman trilogy, at least to my personal preference.) Either way this won't change the way I look at Wonder Woman. The character has made a social impact sure, but not to the extent of Batman, Spiderman, or hell, even Deadpool. I reason this because she is exactly what she is, a superhero. Except she doesn't stand out or have something she does that seperates her from the especially large crowd of heroes. Spider-Man has to find a way to survive villains he used to know as friends, while balancing his home life and super life. He's just a kid. Batman is a tormented man who's past haunts him, so instead of moping he makes something of himself. He's just sad. Relatable characters. The only relatable thing about Wonder Woman is that she a woman. And that's what her market is based on. Sure she can battle Superman or some villain, and it'd look dope. She's just not an interesting enough character to be intested in. What is her weakness? What keeps her down everyday, just for her to overcome it? Being a woman. I can sure relate to that. Me myself can breath. I was born with it and many don't actually care if I do or don't, but now it's got me chained down. Not relatable. So why is this trailer glorifying the birth of this character? Sales most likely. Or the idea is simply artistic? It doesn't say anything, but it's never been put on screen before. And really at the end of the day, originality is what artists strive for. Thanks Wonder Woman.",43,5

6eHExt8C0qw,In retrospect.. The concept does sound obscene..,72,0
6eHExt8C0qw,wheres gal gadot,50,4
6eHExt8C0qw,"Why is this trailer so dramatic? It's a film about how a guy got inspired by his sexual relationship with two women and wrote a fetish fiction about a female superhero. It isn't inception, it's an art film that's trying to say something different about society's treatment of woman in positions of power, ironically choosing the one heroine who's kryptonite is men with whips. At least the concept is original, but I'm not completely sure what this movie is actually trying to say, if anything. Obviously a film doesn't need a message to drill into the viewers head as it can just tell a story, but now of all times? When the feminist movement is being popularized and slandered by the internet? Perhaps it's banking on the popularity of the previous Wonder Woman film, which itself is trying to bank on the feminist movement. (It wasn't even a good movie when being set to the standards of Homecoming and the Batman trilogy, at least to my personal preference.) Either way this won't change the way I look at Wonder Woman. The character has made a social impact sure, but not to the extent of Batman, Spiderman, or hell, even Deadpool. I reason this because she is exactly what she is, a superhero. Except she doesn't stand out or have something she does that seperates her from the especially large crowd of heroes. Spider-Man has to find a way to survive villains he used to know as friends, while balancing his home life and super life. He's just a kid. Batman is a tormented man who's past haunts him, so instead of moping he makes something of himself. He's just sad. Relatable characters. The only relatable thing about Wonder Woman is that she a woman. And that's what her market is based on. Sure she can battle Superman or some villain, and it'd look dope. She's just not an interesting enough character to be intested in. What is her weakness? What keeps her down everyday, just for her to overcome it? Being a woman. I can sure relate to that. Me myself can breath. I was born with it and many don't actually care if I do or don't, but now it's got me chained down. Not relatable. So why is this trailer glorifying the birth of this character? Sales most likely. Or the idea is simply artistic? It doesn't say anything, but it's never been put on screen before. And really at the end of the day, originality is what artists strive for. Thanks Wonder Woman.",43,5

URvC6T_xhE0,"Whilst this isn't acceptable and should never be if we want to live in a civilized society, I think people also need to be more aware why people behave this way and know that it's a reflection of them, not us. I recall wondering why I was the one who was advised to have counselling when my ex and mother were behaving abysmally, abusing me and, indirectly, my family but I know now that the likelihood of my ex and my mother having counselling was remote, that they would realistically never change much if at all...I was the only one who could make it stop by seeing what they were doing and the part I played in reacting to their button pushing...falling directly into the traps they had set for me. I had to learn to be fearless and put my hand up to stop them advancing. Of course, that would have been a lot easier if there were laws back then against psychological abuse, with that support at least I would have felt stronger and possibly not so physically broken now..if psychologically a lot stronger. So we don't create a world of victims we must be resilient to bullying as well as supported in putting a stop to the abuse both online and offline. A stronger signal needs to be sent out that this is not acceptable, it's not clever, it's not strength, it is weakness, ignorance, projection and downright nasty.

URvC6T_xhE0,"There’s a MAJOR problem with this video, and that is the idea that this behavior is unacceptable or rare in real life. The whole message hinges on the idea that online, people spew hate in ways they would never do in the real world because of anonymity. But that’s wrong and we know it. How many videos are readily available on online of people losing their shit at Muslims and black people and gay people and trans people? In restaurants and in public and in their homes? How many people suffer attacks that start with a slur and end with a burial? The people who made this video either intentionally or unintentionally painted those occurrences as rare, as if they only happen with a fringe minority. But I can tell you in my own life and in the lives of those around me, this shit is already IRL. It was NEVER just online.",4,2

URvC6T_xhE0,"Don't try to strangle the ignorance on the internet. You will only make people hide their true selves and it won't change how they feel. Talk against it with ideas.

You’re only a victim of it if you let it bother you, like you can just block the person or report them, it’s so easy. In real life you’re being physically confronted and can’t do anything to get out of the situation. One time a guy I’d never met wrote this GIANT hate comment towards me, saying my art was garbage and I was worthless, and did I cry and kill myself? No. I laughed and recorded videos of myself mocking him, sent them to him, and then blocked him. Yeah it’s unnecessary to comment rude things online but they only hurt you if you let them.

DUMEmGUc7yc,I LOVE the behind the scenes stuff! Always have! I just find it so fascinating to see how everything it put together. And the few times I've had tours of theaters and they have toured us around the backstage I absolutely love it! But would love the chance to just freely wander.,0,0
DUMEmGUc7yc,"This video hits me in a really cool way -- as someone who has a career working backstage as an electrician, it makes me so happy to see people curious about the work my colleagues and I do and the environment we do it in.  I've worked with some brilliant engineers, architects, and diplomats (in laymen's terms, that is what they might be considered...their real titles are technicians, designers, and managers), and a lot of our job ultimately is to make our job look like it doesn't exist.  The lights?  Someone hangs those from a ladder, lift, scaffolding, or even climbing harness, and makes sure they are pointing in just the right direction and does the math to make sure they don't overload the circuits.  Then they proceed to program and operate the spaceship-like console that tells every single one of what is probably hundreds of them when to turn on and what to do.  And every aspect of backstage is like that since we have to create our own world to transport the audience to in any given venue.  So yeah, I think the guts of something are often just as beautiful and intriguing as the outer facade -- maybe sometimes more so (but I'm kind of biased).",0,0

DUMEmGUc7yc,"My high school reportedly has the largest auditorium west of the Mississippi river! I actually worked backstage there and at my junior high school. One of the most interesting things about my high school backstage was actually underneath it. The stage has an orchestra pit with a hydraulic lift. Under the stage itself there is a sizeable storage area. You can also get underneath the lift itself. I went under it one time to help change a few lightbulbs with the stage manager while severely under the influence of Nyquil because I was sick and we didn't have any Dayquil and I was sick. It was a miracle that I went the entire school day without falling asleep! Oh, memories of high school....",0,0

DUMEmGUc7yc,"When I was backstage crew for high school theater and was cleaning up the confetti once the house lights came on and people were leaving, the director told me to stop, called me back and said leave the magic on the stage for them. And that's the thing, the audience wants to have an ethereal moment of being transported away as if by magic, letting it linger on in their minds. All live performance is like that. Personally I adore backstages because I worked there a lot and still do in event planning, and it's always about presenting the best side, making sure everything falls in place, even if we're freaking out about some details, on the surface as long as it looks fine, then we've made magic. It's made people more demanding, perhaps? That because they're used to seeing everything work out virtually perfectly that they think they can demand little extra things here and there and it'll be fulfilled easily. Still, backstages are this liminal place where all the hidden work goes and it's always an interesting view.",1,0

We found a room with a couch in it and no idea why it was even there because it seemed to be at the bottom of a ladder for getting up to the roof, and all sorts of little rooms and cubbies and it was basically a human sized mouse warren, and it was wonderful.

JudqBA5is6M,"One cannot keep focused any longer. Think about it, there are too many things going on all a one point in time, all the time. \\nThe ratio in America now is 3 to 1. For every 1 logical, hard working person there is now 3 of these irrational, violent, thugs running our streets. These thugs are producing 5 to 1. For every one of our babies we raise, love, and care for they are having 5 how are neglected, beat, and unwanted because we pay for them to do so. STOP!!! REFUSE to pay for welfare any longer. If we do nothing now, by the time our children are our age, this country will look and feel like a third-world. WAKE UP PEOPLE.\\nDo the people even know that the first man to legally own a slave in America was a BLACK man named Anthony Johnson? Look it up people education is everything today. Let us talk about privilege for a moment; As it all stands now, not one white person truly knows what it feels like to take pride in our own race without fear of being persecuted. If a white person is poor we are looked down on as being lazy, with blacks however it is because “racism”.  If a black person has money they are looked up to, but if their white has it then they are “spoon-feed”, or “exploiting others”. If a white commits a violent crime towards blacks they are “racist” and will be prosecuted to the fullest, but if a black against white crime happens it is “justified”. No white person alive “since 1961” has ever known what is like to get hired for a job over another race, because of our skin tone. With ‘affirmative action’ black children can go to private schools for free, but whites must pay, the same thing with colleges, the workforce, etc. When a white person commits a crime it is on every media outlet, but black flash mobs, gruesome murders, and all racist actions are covered by all media outlets. If a white person speaks anything against one's beliefs or makes an insensitive comment they now get fired, persecuted, harassed, and tyrannized. If a black person speaks against someone’s beliefs, and/or makes an insensitive comment nothing negative happens to them, blacks don’t even get called out on it. If and when a black person gets pulled over by the police everyone assumes it because “racism”. A black person can even be pointing a gun at the police, and people say it is because “racism”. If a white man does the same act, they are crazy, stupid, and a criminal. Blacks can, and do blame all their shortcomings on racism. Over 70% of black fathers do not take part in their children’s lives, and the same amount of mothers raise their children to become thugs, from “racism”? Ever since ‘affirmative affirmation’ took place more American have died, than all the U.S. wars combined at the hand of black thugs shooting guns, from “racism”? Anywhere you look on this planet, if the population makes up just 12% or more of the black race violence follows, from “racism”?\\n\\nPeople are so brainwashed by everything they see and hear, even our schools breed “racism” by teaching black victimization, and white privilege. Look up a man named Anthony Johnson and you will see that he was a free black man in America who owned black slaves. Johnson was the first American to even go to court and have his slave documented. Large numbers of free blacks owned some of the biggest plantations in America, which were operated by black slaves that they owned. Did I mention that only 1.4% of all Americans owned slaves? Not one of these facts is mentioned when our children learn about slavery because they want to teach hate. When you get down to it, slavery happened all over the world, to all races. Take a look at the 16th -18th century, it is estimated that 1.5 million Christian Europeans were enslaved in South Africa in the Barbary Slave Trade. Source - http://blog.encyclopediavirginia.org/2011/12/slavery-by-the-numbers/\\nThe media stepped in with their race baiting with Zimmerman, it is also factual that the media showed pictures of Zimmerman as a white man, even went so far as to lighten his pictures, and only showed pictures of  Trayvon from years before the actual incident. Here is the proof in that; https://youtu.be/qfcDIwky8lU\\nObama had a chance to step forward and put a stop to it all, but instead, he got on television, saying Trayvon could have been his son. People are so full of hate that they will not accept these truths. \\nI am telling you, people, we are all being used as sheep, controlled by television, Hollywood, schools, and our government. Who controls all these agendas? $$$$ Wake up, these elites are smart. We have repeated history, and will continue to do so if we do not WAKE UP!!! \\nIf you look into The Bell Curve you will find it scientifically proven that different races have different IQ's no matter where their environment. Yet, we are not allowed to speak about it because it's considered racist. So humanity is being held back and dumbed down. East Asians IQ's are higher than whites, and we can handle that and admit it, yet those who are unintelligent are less logical, more violent, etc..etc.. So these bastards behind the Banking system are feeding these animals white hatred, causing our people to pay for them to not only produce babies, but to make more than us, and they are forcing in millions with these low IQs into only the majority white nations around the world. \\n\\nThe United States alone accepts each year—from 70,000 Refugees in 2015 to 85,000 in 2016 and 100,000 in 2017—and scale up the number of Syrian refugees admitted to at least 10,000 for the current fiscal year, which began October 1. They are spreading them out, so it does not look Biblical. These “Refugees” do not care about our morals and values. They have not come here to help preserve our way of life, nor do they want to contribute positively to our society. We must realize that these people are being placed into any, and only the “majority white” countries around the world. If whites were any other race everyone would be calling this mass-genocide.\\nFollowing all this, if you look into the population in the once majority white nations around the globe compared to this banking system you will see that the banking system is/was doomed, and this is just one reason why we are watching all the immigrants come from these countries around the world. Think about it. If whites were being forced into Africa, so much so that the country's black population was now the minority. This monetary system enslaves us and turns us against one and other. https://youtu.be/mII9NZ8MMVM \\nOn June 4, 1963, Kennedy signed a virtually unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110. This order would strip the Federal Reserve of its power to loan money to the United States Federal Government at interest. November 22, 1963, JFK was assassinated. You all need to wake up and see what’s really going on. This monetary system has caused this. They want whites to be eliminated. They own, promote, and distribute everything we see on television, movies, stores, governments, countries, etc. Look it up, even without all the places this monetary system owns, they still have 99.9% of this planet.\\nJust think about the shows on television now compared to the ones back in the day. The ones back in the days had morals and values, and the shows that play now, like Shameless, project the unhealthy lifestyles to be grandiose. Look back and anyone can see the television has played a major role in society’s behavior. It is our duty to make this country safe for our children and their children. Why are we not uniting? Even our schooling system is spreading identity confusion. A big portion of young people do not even know which sex they are attracted to, and this system caused it all. Back when times were better one family member could work, make enough to take care of the whole house, and one parent could stay home to teach children morals and values to live by. They saw this and modified it. All we must do is unit while we still have the numbers. \\nSince President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in late 1963, more Americans have been killed by gunfire in this country than died in all U.S. wars. Not because of guns, but from black people. I believe it is safe to say it is the majority, and blacks need to stop blaming whites for everything the black race has become. You can look anywhere they are in the world if their numbers are at, or above 12%, Violence follows.\\n\\nThe rules, and principles that are unfairly applied in different ways towards the white people and what they believe in, is not applied in the same manner for any other race in this nation. We must come together and save what those before us have fought and died for, we must unite, taking back what is rightfully ours, our children's, and infinite generations after. Our state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on our way of life, behavior, and political views are now and have been taken away from our people. \\nThis country will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything. – M.G.P.",1,26

DUMEmGUc7yc,"When I was backstage crew for high school theater and was cleaning up the confetti once the house lights came on and people were leaving, the director told me to stop, called me back and said leave the magic on the stage for them. And that's the thing, the audience wants to have an ethereal moment of being transported away as if by magic, letting it linger on in their minds. All live performance is like that. Personally I adore backstages because I worked there a lot and still do in event planning, and it's always about presenting the best side, making sure everything falls in place, even if we're freaking out about some details, on the surface as long as it looks fine, then we've made magic. It's made people more demanding, perhaps? That because they're used to seeing everything work out virtually perfectly that they think they can demand little extra things here and there and it'll be fulfilled easily. Still, backstages are this liminal place where all the hidden work goes and it's always an interesting view.",1,0

DUMEmGUc7yc,"This sums up quite nicely why I decided to go into architecture school and why I love architecture so much. The thrill of being able to discover and perhaps understand the workings behind the screen is amazing, and to then turn around and be able to *design* all that behind stuff is even cooler. Being able to be that magician, to create the beautiful space and to simultaneously know all the bits and pieces that make it work, to find a way for all those disparate parts to come together and work and function in such a cohesive beauty is fantastic. But, I agree with you, too often we seem absolutely concerned with hiding all that away. The magic of the surface is exquisite, but as someone who now understands all that goes into it, I think having that additional knowledge of layers makes the actual exterior that much more amazing. By seeing the back stage, the theater itself is made that much more powerful. Why don't we celebrate those things behind? Why don't we let them peek through the surface, allow the people to peel back the facade for just a moment, and catch a glimpse of all that goes on underneath? Wouldn't that make the wonder that much more palpable? \\n\\nI love a beautiful facade as much as the next guy. But it's the things behind that screen, the layers and depth, that really give it meaning.\\n\\nThanks for another great video guys. You never cease to help me marvel at the world.",0,0

DUMEmGUc7yc,"This video hits me in a really cool way -- as someone who has a career working backstage as an electrician, it makes me so happy to see people curious about the work my colleagues and I do and the environment we do it in.  I've worked with some brilliant engineers, architects, and diplomats (in laymen's terms, that is what they might be considered...their real titles are technicians, designers, and managers), and a lot of our job ultimately is to make our job look like it doesn't exist.  The lights?  Someone hangs those from a ladder, lift, scaffolding, or even climbing harness, and makes sure they are pointing in just the right direction and does the math to make sure they don't overload the circuits.  Then they proceed to program and operate the spaceship-like console that tells every single one of what is probably hundreds of them when to turn on and what to do.  And every aspect of backstage is like that since we have to create our own world to transport the audience to in any given venue.  So yeah, I think the guts of something are often just as beautiful and intriguing as the outer facade -- maybe sometimes more so (but I'm kind of biased).",0,0
DUMEmGUc7yc,"Makes me think about how there is an army of (mostly) men who keep the US electrical grid and sewer/plumbing infrastructure functional on a daily basis that allow our lives to run seamlessly.

DUMEmGUc7yc,"My high school reportedly has the largest auditorium west of the Mississippi river! I actually worked backstage there and at my junior high school.

Under the stage itself there is a sizeable storage area. You can also get underneath the lift itself. I went under it one time to help change a few lightbulbs with the stage manager while severely under the influence of Nyquil because I was sick and we didn't have any Dayquil and I was sick.

We found a room with a couch in it and no idea why it was even there because it seemed to be at the bottom of a ladder for getting up to the roof, and all sorts of little rooms and cubbies and it was basically a human sized mouse warren, and it was wonderful.

JudqBA5is6M,"One cannot keep focused any longer. Think about it, there are too many things going on all a one point in time, all the time. \\nThe ratio in America now is 3 to 1. For every 1 logical, hard working person there is now 3 of these irrational, violent, thugs running our streets. These thugs are producing 5 to 1. For every one of our babies we raise, love, and care for they are having 5 how are neglected, beat, and unwanted because we pay for them to do so. STOP!!! REFUSE to pay for welfare any longer. If we do nothing now, by the time our children are our age, this country will look and feel like a third-world. WAKE UP PEOPLE.\\nDo the people even know that the first man to legally own a slave in America was a BLACK man named Anthony Johnson? Look it up people education is everything today. Let us talk about privilege for a moment; As it all stands now, not one white person truly knows what it feels like to take pride in our own race without fear of being persecuted. If a white person is poor we are looked down on as being lazy, with blacks however it is because “racism”.  If a black person has money they are looked up to, but if their white has it then they are “spoon-feed”, or “exploiting others”. If a white commits a violent crime towards blacks they are “racist” and will be prosecuted to the fullest, but if a black against white crime happens it is “justified”. No white person alive “since 1961” has ever known what is like to get hired for a job over another race, because of our skin tone. With ‘affirmative action’ black children can go to private schools for free, but whites must pay, the same thing with colleges, the workforce, etc. When a white person commits a crime it is on every media outlet, but black flash mobs, gruesome murders, and all racist actions are covered by all media outlets. If a white person speaks anything against one's beliefs or makes an insensitive comment they now get fired, persecuted, harassed, and tyrannized. If a black person speaks against someone’s beliefs, and/or makes an insensitive comment nothing negative happens to them, blacks don’t even get called out on it. If and when a black person gets pulled over by the police everyone assumes it because “racism”. A black person can even be pointing a gun at the police, and people say it is because “racism”. If a white man does the same act, they are crazy, stupid, and a criminal. Blacks can, and do blame all their shortcomings on racism. Over 70% of black fathers do not take part in their children’s lives, and the same amount of mothers raise their children to become thugs, from “racism”? Ever since ‘affirmative affirmation’ took place more American have died, than all the U.S. wars combined at the hand of black thugs shooting guns, from “racism”? Anywhere you look on this planet, if the population makes up just 12% or more of the black race violence follows, from “racism”?\\n\\nPeople are so brainwashed by everything they see and hear, even our schools breed “racism” by teaching black victimization, and white privilege. Look up a man named Anthony Johnson and you will see that he was a free black man in America who owned black slaves. Johnson was the first American to even go to court and have his slave documented. Large numbers of free blacks owned some of the biggest plantations in America, which were operated by black slaves that they owned. Did I mention that only 1.4% of all Americans owned slaves? Not one of these facts is mentioned when our children learn about slavery because they want to teach hate. When you get down to it, slavery happened all over the world, to all races. Take a look at the 16th -18th century, it is estimated that 1.5 million Christian Europeans were enslaved in South Africa in the Barbary Slave Trade. Source - http://blog.encyclopediavirginia.org/2011/12/slavery-by-the-numbers/\\nThe media stepped in with their race baiting with Zimmerman, it is also factual that the media showed pictures of Zimmerman as a white man, even went so far as to lighten his pictures, and only showed pictures of  Trayvon from years before the actual incident. Here is the proof in that; https://youtu.be/qfcDIwky8lU\\nObama had a chance to step forward and put a stop to it all, but instead, he got on television, saying Trayvon could have been his son. People are so full of hate that they will not accept these truths. \\nI am telling you, people, we are all being used as sheep, controlled by television, Hollywood, schools, and our government. Who controls all these agendas? $$$$ Wake up, these elites are smart. We have repeated history, and will continue to do so if we do not WAKE UP!!! \\nIf you look into The Bell Curve you will find it scientifically proven that different races have different IQ's no matter where their environment. Yet, we are not allowed to speak about it because it's considered racist. So humanity is being held back and dumbed down. East Asians IQ's are higher than whites, and we can handle that and admit it, yet those who are unintelligent are less logical, more violent, etc..etc.. So these bastards behind the Banking system are feeding these animals white hatred, causing our people to pay for them to not only produce babies, but to make more than us, and they are forcing in millions with these low IQs into only the majority white nations around the world. \\n\\nThe United States alone accepts each year—from 70,000 Refugees in 2015 to 85,000 in 2016 and 100,000 in 2017—and scale up the number of Syrian refugees admitted to at least 10,000 for the current fiscal year, which began October 1. They are spreading them out, so it does not look Biblical. These “Refugees” do not care about our morals and values. They have not come here to help preserve our way of life, nor do they want to contribute positively to our society. We must realize that these people are being placed into any, and only the “majority white” countries around the world. If whites were any other race everyone would be calling this mass-genocide.\\nFollowing all this, if you look into the population in the once majority white nations around the globe compared to this banking system you will see that the banking system is/was doomed, and this is just one reason why we are watching all the immigrants come from these countries around the world. Think about it. If whites were being forced into Africa, so much so that the country's black population was now the minority. This monetary system enslaves us and turns us against one and other. https://youtu.be/mII9NZ8MMVM \\nOn June 4, 1963, Kennedy signed a virtually unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110. This order would strip the Federal Reserve of its power to loan money to the United States Federal Government at interest. November 22, 1963, JFK was assassinated. You all need to wake up and see what’s really going on. This monetary system has caused this. They want whites to be eliminated. They own, promote, and distribute everything we see on television, movies, stores, governments, countries, etc. Look it up, even without all the places this monetary system owns, they still have 99.9% of this planet.\\nJust think about the shows on television now compared to the ones back in the day. The ones back in the days had morals and values, and the shows that play now, like Shameless, project the unhealthy lifestyles to be grandiose. Look back and anyone can see the television has played a major role in society’s behavior. It is our duty to make this country safe for our children and their children. Why are we not uniting? Even our schooling system is spreading identity confusion. A big portion of young people do not even know which sex they are attracted to, and this system caused it all. Back when times were better one family member could work, make enough to take care of the whole house, and one parent could stay home to teach children morals and values to live by. They saw this and modified it. All we must do is unit while we still have the numbers. \\nSince President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in late 1963, more Americans have been killed by gunfire in this country than died in all U.S. wars. Not because of guns, but from black people. I believe it is safe to say it is the majority, and blacks need to stop blaming whites for everything the black race has become. You can look anywhere they are in the world if their numbers are at, or above 12%, Violence follows.\\n\\nThe rules, and principles that are unfairly applied in different ways towards the white people and what they believe in, is not applied in the same manner for any other race in this nation. We must come together and save what those before us have fought and died for, we must unite, taking back what is rightfully ours, our children's, and infinite generations after. Our state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on our way of life, behavior, and political views are now and have been taken away from our people. \\nThis country will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything. – M.G.P.",1,2

I’m an everyday person... not a star, and not a 6’ plus, amazon model. I’m not what you live for. I’m Angie. I am somebody. Actually, I’m a very polite lady, who reached too far and believed I could have a conversation with someone with her ‘favorite gorgeous baby gentleman.’ I could not have been more wrong, stupid, and grossly text lying abused. Since then, my Facebook experience has been horrible! I DO NOT KNOW YOU, NEVER HAVE I WISHED TO MEET YOU, NOR ASKED TO MEET YOU! I BEG OF YOU SIR, TO PLEASE STOP CHANGING MY, (‘MY,’ equates to... you changing my texts to suit what ‘you only wish I had texted about you but, didn’t!’). I do not like, want anything to do with you! I loathe your image, conceited self, as I do not spend my life online in Facebook or Twitter. You are violating ‘your’ terms of agreement with Facebook, hacking me, waiting for me to become extremely upset, unhinged, invasion of my privacy, listening to my mother, my father, ease dropping into our ‘private conversation’s,’ on so many levels, THAT IS SO DARN WRONG, watching me making coffee, unaware that you are able to see me, in a tee shirt only, (That was my OMG AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ELSE THIS iPhone ALLOWED YOU TO SEE WITH YOUR ‘BLACK MARKET’ device’s, as I am questioning if those devices are legal or not, seeing me through my ‘RealTime Camera,’ was never aware that someone could do such a hideous ‘thing’ like listening to a ‘families very private conversation’ ,’ because you have hacked my iPhone to suit your personal needs and desires! You are a cruel person, Mr. Grinch! Not to mention violations, my mom gained your attention last week by telling you ‘Mick! You better put those pictures back.’ You listened and you put them back. It has only excelled from there, and that didn’t have to happen. I have deleted you from my iPhone photo’s, The Rolling Stones offered to everyone to ‘Save Photo.’ I legally saved them only for you to illegally delete them, take them out of my camera. You don’t want me to have Rolling Stones photo’s and the most amazing and legal way to handle that was to ask for me to delete them, not to hack me and take them yourself. You have made me reset my iPhone to its original version, ‘when I purchased this iPhone,’ taking me hours of my life and time to change everything I set up with my ISP, changing every single Apple email addresses, password’s and passcodes. To no avail, you were right back into my iPhone, ‘I pay for,’... me and ‘NOT YOU!’ I’m in my own private Hell because of what you have accomplished.., ‘embarrassment explaining to other’s who read my Facebook texts that I’m having an on-going problem with someone who wishes for me to have ‘no peace, like you own Facebook,’ at a certain point it becomes extreme bullying, emotional abuse, emotional stress, I’m paying for your abuse at my expense. You have issues! You just don’t want me to be on Facebook, as if you own Facebook! You are a superstar and you are someone and I’m not important enough to be on Facebook. May I ask... DO YOU OWN FACEBOOK? Last time I checked, you didn’t own Facebook. You relate to me by using YouTube and band song’s. You feel you are right. You are very cruel. tc.",0,0

DUMEmGUc7yc,"This sums up quite nicely why I decided to go into architecture school and why I love architecture so much. The thrill of being able to discover and perhaps understand the workings behind the screen is amazing, and to then turn around and be able to *design* all that behind stuff is even cooler. Being able to be that magician, to create the beautiful space and to simultaneously know all the bits and pieces that make it work, to find a way for all those disparate parts to come together and work and function in such a cohesive beauty is fantastic. But, I agree with you, too often we seem absolutely concerned with hiding all that away. The magic of the surface is exquisite, but as someone who now understands all that goes into it, I think having that additional knowledge of layers makes the actual exterior that much more amazing. By seeing the back stage, the theater itself is made that much more powerful. Why don't we celebrate those things behind? Why don't we let them peek through the surface, allow the people to peel back the facade for just a moment, and catch a glimpse of all that goes on underneath? Wouldn't that make the wonder that much more palpable? \\n\\nI love a beautiful facade as much as the next guy. But it's the things behind that screen, the layers and depth, that really give it meaning.\\n\\nThanks for another great video guys. You never cease to help me marvel at the world.",0,0

DUMEmGUc7yc,"This is a message that I think is seriously lacking from mass consciousness and really needed right now. We, by and large, have very little idea how everything works. How much work goes into the most basic facilities we use without thinking every day. The cost of having this pretty, clean, structured world that suits us so perfectly.\\n\\nI certainly don't believe we all need to return to subsistence farming in houses we built ourselves, but we should at least be aware of what goes into our every day life.",0,0
DUMEmGUc7yc,"As a sound guy, I love back stages!",1,0
DUMEmGUc7yc,"When I was backstage crew for high school theater and was cleaning up the confetti once the house lights came on and people were leaving, the director told me to stop, called me back and said leave the magic on the stage for them. And that's the thing, the audience wants to have an ethereal moment of being transported away as if by magic, letting it linger on in their minds. All live performance is like that. Personally I adore backstages because I worked there a lot and still do in event planning, and it's always about presenting the best side, making sure everything falls in place, even if we're freaking out about some details, on the surface as long as it looks fine, then we've made magic. It's made people more demanding, perhaps? That because they're used to seeing everything work out virtually perfectly that they think they can demand little extra things here and there and it'll be fulfilled easily. Still, backstages are this liminal place where all the hidden work goes and it's always an interesting view.",2,0

DUMEmGUc7yc,"This video hits me in a really cool way -- as someone who has a career working backstage as an electrician, it makes me so happy to see people curious about the work my colleagues and I do and the environment we do it in.  I've worked with some brilliant engineers, architects, and diplomats (in laymen's terms, that is what they might be considered...their real titles are technicians, designers, and managers), and a lot of our job ultimately is to make our job look like it doesn't exist.  The lights?  Someone hangs those from a ladder, lift, scaffolding, or even climbing harness, and makes sure they are pointing in just the right direction and does the math to make sure they don't overload the circuits.  Then they proceed to program and operate the spaceship-like console that tells every single one of what is probably hundreds of them when to turn on and what to do.  And every aspect of backstage is like that since we have to create our own world to transport the audience to in any given venue.  So yeah, I think the guts of something are often just as beautiful and intriguing as the outer facade -- maybe sometimes more so (but I'm kind of biased).",0,0

JudqBA5is6M,"One cannot keep focused any longer. Think about it, there are too many things going on all a one point in time, all the time. \\nThe ratio in America now is 3 to 1. For every 1 logical, hard working person there is now 3 of these irrational, violent, thugs running our streets. These thugs are producing 5 to 1. For every one of our babies we raise, love, and care for they are having 5 how are neglected, beat, and unwanted because we pay for them to do so. STOP!!! REFUSE to pay for welfare any longer. If we do nothing now, by the time our children are our age, this country will look and feel like a third-world. WAKE UP PEOPLE.\\nDo the people even know that the first man to legally own a slave in America was a BLACK man named Anthony Johnson? Look it up people education is everything today. Let us talk about privilege for a moment; As it all stands now, not one white person truly knows what it feels like to take pride in our own race without fear of being persecuted. If a white person is poor we are looked down on as being lazy, with blacks however it is because “racism”.  If a black person has money they are looked up to, but if their white has it then they are “spoon-feed”, or “exploiting others”. If a white commits a violent crime towards blacks they are “racist” and will be prosecuted to the fullest, but if a black against white crime happens it is “justified”. No white person alive “since 1961” has ever known what is like to get hired for a job over another race, because of our skin tone. With ‘affirmative action’ black children can go to private schools for free, but whites must pay, the same thing with colleges, the workforce, etc. When a white person commits a crime it is on every media outlet, but black flash mobs, gruesome murders, and all racist actions are covered by all media outlets. If a white person speaks anything against one's beliefs or makes an insensitive comment they now get fired, persecuted, harassed, and tyrannized. If a black person speaks against someone’s beliefs, and/or makes an insensitive comment nothing negative happens to them, blacks don’t even get called out on it. If and when a black person gets pulled over by the police everyone assumes it because “racism”. A black person can even be pointing a gun at the police, and people say it is because “racism”. If a white man does the same act, they are crazy, stupid, and a criminal. Blacks can, and do blame all their shortcomings on racism. Over 70% of black fathers do not take part in their children’s lives, and the same amount of mothers raise their children to become thugs, from “racism”? Ever since ‘affirmative affirmation’ took place more American have died, than all the U.S. wars combined at the hand of black thugs shooting guns, from “racism”? Anywhere you look on this planet, if the population makes up just 12% or more of the black race violence follows, from “racism”?\\n\\nPeople are so brainwashed by everything they see and hear, even our schools breed “racism” by teaching black victimization, and white privilege. Look up a man named Anthony Johnson and you will see that he was a free black man in America who owned black slaves. Johnson was the first American to even go to court and have his slave documented. Large numbers of free blacks owned some of the biggest plantations in America, which were operated by black slaves that they owned. Did I mention that only 1.4% of all Americans owned slaves? Not one of these facts is mentioned when our children learn about slavery because they want to teach hate. When you get down to it, slavery happened all over the world, to all races. Take a look at the 16th -18th century, it is estimated that 1.5 million Christian Europeans were enslaved in South Africa in the Barbary Slave Trade. Source - http://blog.encyclopediavirginia.org/2011/12/slavery-by-the-numbers/\\nThe media stepped in with their race baiting with Zimmerman, it is also factual that the media showed pictures of Zimmerman as a white man, even went so far as to lighten his pictures, and only showed pictures of  Trayvon from years before the actual incident. Here is the proof in that; https://youtu.be/qfcDIwky8lU\\nObama had a chance to step forward and put a stop to it all, but instead, he got on television, saying Trayvon could have been his son. People are so full of hate that they will not accept these truths. \\nI am telling you, people, we are all being used as sheep, controlled by television, Hollywood, schools, and our government. Who controls all these agendas? $$$$ Wake up, these elites are smart. We have repeated history, and will continue to do so if we do not WAKE UP!!! \\nIf you look into The Bell Curve you will find it scientifically proven that different races have different IQ's no matter where their environment. Yet, we are not allowed to speak about it because it's considered racist. So humanity is being held back and dumbed down. East Asians IQ's are higher than whites, and we can handle that and admit it, yet those who are unintelligent are less logical, more violent, etc..etc.. So these bastards behind the Banking system are feeding these animals white hatred, causing our people to pay for them to not only produce babies, but to make more than us, and they are forcing in millions with these low IQs into only the majority white nations around the world. \\n\\nThe United States alone accepts each year—from 70,000 Refugees in 2015 to 85,000 in 2016 and 100,000 in 2017—and scale up the number of Syrian refugees admitted to at least 10,000 for the current fiscal year, which began October 1. They are spreading them out, so it does not look Biblical. These “Refugees” do not care about our morals and values. They have not come here to help preserve our way of life, nor do they want to contribute positively to our society. We must realize that these people are being placed into any, and only the “majority white” countries around the world. If whites were any other race everyone would be calling this mass-genocide.\\nFollowing all this, if you look into the population in the once majority white nations around the globe compared to this banking system you will see that the banking system is/was doomed, and this is just one reason why we are watching all the immigrants come from these countries around the world. Think about it. If whites were being forced into Africa, so much so that the country's black population was now the minority. This monetary system enslaves us and turns us against one and other. https://youtu.be/mII9NZ8MMVM \\nOn June 4, 1963, Kennedy signed a virtually unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110. This order would strip the Federal Reserve of its power to loan money to the United States Federal Government at interest. November 22, 1963, JFK was assassinated. You all need to wake up and see what’s really going on. This monetary system has caused this. They want whites to be eliminated. They own, promote, and distribute everything we see on television, movies, stores, governments, countries, etc. Look it up, even without all the places this monetary system owns, they still have 99.9% of this planet.\\nJust think about the shows on television now compared to the ones back in the day. The ones back in the days had morals and values, and the shows that play now, like Shameless, project the unhealthy lifestyles to be grandiose. Look back and anyone can see the television has played a major role in society’s behavior. It is our duty to make this country safe for our children and their children. Why are we not uniting? Even our schooling system is spreading identity confusion. A big portion of young people do not even know which sex they are attracted to, and this system caused it all. Back when times were better one family member could work, make enough to take care of the whole house, and one parent could stay home to teach children morals and values to live by. They saw this and modified it. All we must do is unit while we still have the numbers. \\nSince President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in late 1963, more Americans have been killed by gunfire in this country than died in all U.S. wars. Not because of guns, but from black people. I believe it is safe to say it is the majority, and blacks need to stop blaming whites for everything the black race has become. You can look anywhere they are in the world if their numbers are at, or above 12%, Violence follows.\\n\\nThe rules, and principles that are unfairly applied in different ways towards the white people and what they believe in, is not applied in the same manner for any other race in this nation. We must come together and save what those before us have fought and died for, we must unite, taking back what is rightfully ours, our children's, and infinite generations after. Our state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on our way of life, behavior, and political views are now and have been taken away from our people. \\nThis country will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything. – M.G.P.",1,2

DUMEmGUc7yc,"This sums up quite nicely why I decided to go into architecture school and why I love architecture so much. The thrill of being able to discover and perhaps understand the workings behind the screen is amazing, and to then turn around and be able to *design* all that behind stuff is even cooler. Being able to be that magician, to create the beautiful space and to simultaneously know all the bits and pieces that make it work, to find a way for all those disparate parts to come together and work and function in such a cohesive beauty is fantastic. But, I agree with you, too often we seem absolutely concerned with hiding all that away. The magic of the surface is exquisite, but as someone who now understands all that goes into it, I think having that additional knowledge of layers makes the actual exterior that much more amazing. By seeing the back stage, the theater itself is made that much more powerful. Why don't we celebrate those things behind? Why don't we let them peek through the surface, allow the people to peel back the facade for just a moment, and catch a glimpse of all that goes on underneath? Wouldn't that make the wonder that much more palpable? \\n\\nI love a beautiful facade as much as the next guy. But it's the things behind that screen, the layers and depth, that really give it meaning.\\n\\nThanks for another great video guys. You never cease to help me marvel at the world.",0,0

DUMEmGUc7yc,"This video hits me in a really cool way -- as someone who has a career working backstage as an electrician, it makes me so happy to see people curious about the work my colleagues and I do and the environment we do it in.  I've worked with some brilliant engineers, architects, and diplomats (in laymen's terms, that is what they might be considered...their real titles are technicians, designers, and managers), and a lot of our job ultimately is to make our job look like it doesn't exist.  The lights?  Someone hangs those from a ladder, lift, scaffolding, or even climbing harness, and makes sure they are pointing in just the right direction and does the math to make sure they don't overload the circuits.  Then they proceed to program and operate the spaceship-like console that tells every single one of what is probably hundreds of them when to turn on and what to do.  And every aspect of backstage is like that since we have to create our own world to transport the audience to in any given venue.  So yeah, I think the guts of something are often just as beautiful and intriguing as the outer facade -- maybe sometimes more so (but I'm kind of biased).",0,0

DUMEmGUc7yc,"When I was backstage crew for high school theater and was cleaning up the confetti once the house lights came on and people were leaving, the director told me to stop, called me back and said leave the magic on the stage for them. And that's the thing, the audience wants to have an ethereal moment of being transported away as if by magic, letting it linger on in their minds. All live performance is like that. Personally I adore backstages because I worked there a lot and still do in event planning, and it's always about presenting the best side, making sure everything falls in place, even if we're freaking out about some details, on the surface as long as it looks fine, then we've made magic. It's made people more demanding, perhaps? That because they're used to seeing everything work out virtually perfectly that they think they can demand little extra things here and there and it'll be fulfilled easily. Still, backstages are this liminal place where all the hidden work goes and it's always an interesting view.",2,0

MiQYQQcG1HQ,Walmart’s business prowess doesn’t come from their number of brick and mortar stores. Their competitive advantage comes from their IT department and correlated inventory procedures .

To make thing worse I worked 10 hour days and got one 30min break and another 20min brake that’s all. Never mine working 70hours a week with mandatory overtime during the holidays if you done show up and don’t have time saved your canned. Also no cell phones in the building.

JudqBA5is6M,"One cannot keep focused any longer. Think about it, there are too many things going on all a one point in time, all the time. \\nThe ratio in America now is 3 to 1. For every 1 logical, hard working person there is now 3 of these irrational, violent, thugs running our streets. These thugs are producing 5 to 1. For every one of our babies we raise, love, and care for they are having 5 how are neglected, beat, and unwanted because we pay for them to do so. STOP!!! REFUSE to pay for welfare any longer. If we do nothing now, by the time our children are our age, this country will look and feel like a third-world. WAKE UP PEOPLE.\\nDo the people even know that the first man to legally own a slave in America was a BLACK man named Anthony Johnson? Look it up people education is everything today. Let us talk about privilege for a moment; As it all stands now, not one white person truly knows what it feels like to take pride in our own race without fear of being persecuted. If a white person is poor we are looked down on as being lazy, with blacks however it is because “racism”.  If a black person has money they are looked up to, but if their white has it then they are “spoon-feed”, or “exploiting others”. If a white commits a violent crime towards blacks they are “racist” and will be prosecuted to the fullest, but if a black against white crime happens it is “justified”. No white person alive “since 1961” has ever known what is like to get hired for a job over another race, because of our skin tone. With ‘affirmative action’ black children can go to private schools for free, but whites must pay, the same thing with colleges, the workforce, etc. When a white person commits a crime it is on every media outlet, but black flash mobs, gruesome murders, and all racist actions are covered by all media outlets. If a white person speaks anything against one's beliefs or makes an insensitive comment they now get fired, persecuted, harassed, and tyrannized. If a black person speaks against someone’s beliefs, and/or makes an insensitive comment nothing negative happens to them, blacks don’t even get called out on it. If and when a black person gets pulled over by the police everyone assumes it because “racism”. A black person can even be pointing a gun at the police, and people say it is because “racism”. If a white man does the same act, they are crazy, stupid, and a criminal. Blacks can, and do blame all their shortcomings on racism. Over 70% of black fathers do not take part in their children’s lives, and the same amount of mothers raise their children to become thugs, from “racism”? Ever since ‘affirmative affirmation’ took place more American have died, than all the U.S. wars combined at the hand of black thugs shooting guns, from “racism”? Anywhere you look on this planet, if the population makes up just 12% or more of the black race violence follows, from “racism”?\\n\\nPeople are so brainwashed by everything they see and hear, even our schools breed “racism” by teaching black victimization, and white privilege. Look up a man named Anthony Johnson and you will see that he was a free black man in America who owned black slaves. Johnson was the first American to even go to court and have his slave documented. Large numbers of free blacks owned some of the biggest plantations in America, which were operated by black slaves that they owned. Did I mention that only 1.4% of all Americans owned slaves? Not one of these facts is mentioned when our children learn about slavery because they want to teach hate. When you get down to it, slavery happened all over the world, to all races. Take a look at the 16th -18th century, it is estimated that 1.5 million Christian Europeans were enslaved in South Africa in the Barbary Slave Trade. Source - http://blog.encyclopediavirginia.org/2011/12/slavery-by-the-numbers/\\nThe media stepped in with their race baiting with Zimmerman, it is also factual that the media showed pictures of Zimmerman as a white man, even went so far as to lighten his pictures, and only showed pictures of  Trayvon from years before the actual incident. Here is the proof in that; https://youtu.be/qfcDIwky8lU\\nObama had a chance to step forward and put a stop to it all, but instead, he got on television, saying Trayvon could have been his son. People are so full of hate that they will not accept these truths. \\nI am telling you, people, we are all being used as sheep, controlled by television, Hollywood, schools, and our government. Who controls all these agendas? $$$$ Wake up, these elites are smart. We have repeated history, and will continue to do so if we do not WAKE UP!!! \\nIf you look into The Bell Curve you will find it scientifically proven that different races have different IQ's no matter where their environment. Yet, we are not allowed to speak about it because it's considered racist. So humanity is being held back and dumbed down. East Asians IQ's are higher than whites, and we can handle that and admit it, yet those who are unintelligent are less logical, more violent, etc..etc.. So these bastards behind the Banking system are feeding these animals white hatred, causing our people to pay for them to not only produce babies, but to make more than us, and they are forcing in millions with these low IQs into only the majority white nations around the world. \\n\\nThe United States alone accepts each year—from 70,000 Refugees in 2015 to 85,000 in 2016 and 100,000 in 2017—and scale up the number of Syrian refugees admitted to at least 10,000 for the current fiscal year, which began October 1. They are spreading them out, so it does not look Biblical. These “Refugees” do not care about our morals and values. They have not come here to help preserve our way of life, nor do they want to contribute positively to our society. We must realize that these people are being placed into any, and only the “majority white” countries around the world. If whites were any other race everyone would be calling this mass-genocide.\\nFollowing all this, if you look into the population in the once majority white nations around the globe compared to this banking system you will see that the banking system is/was doomed, and this is just one reason why we are watching all the immigrants come from these countries around the world. Think about it. If whites were being forced into Africa, so much so that the country's black population was now the minority. This monetary system enslaves us and turns us against one and other. https://youtu.be/mII9NZ8MMVM \\nOn June 4, 1963, Kennedy signed a virtually unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110. This order would strip the Federal Reserve of its power to loan money to the United States Federal Government at interest. November 22, 1963, JFK was assassinated. You all need to wake up and see what’s really going on. This monetary system has caused this. They want whites to be eliminated. They own, promote, and distribute everything we see on television, movies, stores, governments, countries, etc. Look it up, even without all the places this monetary system owns, they still have 99.9% of this planet.\\nJust think about the shows on television now compared to the ones back in the day. The ones back in the days had morals and values, and the shows that play now, like Shameless, project the unhealthy lifestyles to be grandiose. Look back and anyone can see the television has played a major role in society’s behavior. It is our duty to make this country safe for our children and their children. Why are we not uniting? Even our schooling system is spreading identity confusion. A big portion of young people do not even know which sex they are attracted to, and this system caused it all. Back when times were better one family member could work, make enough to take care of the whole house, and one parent could stay home to teach children morals and values to live by. They saw this and modified it. All we must do is unit while we still have the numbers. \\nSince President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in late 1963, more Americans have been killed by gunfire in this country than died in all U.S. wars. Not because of guns, but from black people. I believe it is safe to say it is the majority, and blacks need to stop blaming whites for everything the black race has become. You can look anywhere they are in the world if their numbers are at, or above 12%, Violence follows.\\n\\nThe rules, and principles that are unfairly applied in different ways towards the white people and what they believe in, is not applied in the same manner for any other race in this nation. We must come together and save what those before us have fought and died for, we must unite, taking back what is rightfully ours, our children's, and infinite generations after. Our state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on our way of life, behavior, and political views are now and have been taken away from our people. \\nThis country will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything. – M.G.P.",1,2

The intro and middle part had too many ideas crammed together, leaving you wondering what's it about and having you pause the video to figure it out. 2nd thing is why this many special effects? its not enough for it to be good, but not as many as relaxing and normal. Either use a lot like in believer, or not as many like top of the world, where it mainly used props. Last thing, why swimming? it doesn't contain too much action, yet you try to make it contain a lot of it.

MiQYQQcG1HQ,"Actually I am not supposed to say this; but I work for Amazon and it's true. Yeah they have great benefits, the pay is decent and with all comes a great cost. Every day you are in an Amazon warehouse; they make sure you are there to work, no cell phones are allowed in the building and they make you go through security every break. Which also adds to the fact that you're being heavily watched with cameras at all times, no matter the hallway, corner, shelf, station you are on, they have eyes on you and you can easily get written up for any reason. Customer satisfaction and customer demand for fast packages every day only gets worst as time goes by, every day new internet users are buying more and more and more, and Amazon can't keep up to be honest, hiring people constantly to fill jobs up, sitting is never allowed unless it's during break. They LITERALLY make sure you are worth what they're paying you for a while shift. Not to mention you have to reach limits and number expectations per day, and if you reach them and your shift is not over, you better keep working because the computer tracks every single minute you were not active and if you are inactive for more than 30 minutes on the job, the managers job is to come by and talk to you about it and then decide to wether write you up or fire you. Amazon's expectafions are at an all time high.

They stress the importance of making rate and will gladly give you a mark up, or move you to a different role where you’re left until you quit or get fired. Most quit. The long hours and little contact with the outside world, followed up with near insane expectations and lame pay...makes it a crushing place to work. If anyone is considering working there, please make sure to use it as a stepping stone, and not a final destination, as it will eat you alive.",1,0

MiQYQQcG1HQ,There is no comparison Amazon is way better. I hate shopping at Wal-Mart mainly because of the crappy employees. I don't know who trains these bozos but I'm sick and tired of the idiots acting like they are there to try and be cool in their blue vests instead of tending to the customer. If I'm ready to check out shut up and talk to people on your own time and do your job. \n\nJust the other day I went to check out and the black bitch told me to go to the other check out lane. I said why can't you check me out. She said bc she was busy. She did nothing but pass work on to an Asian lady. Wal-Mart is so big with so many people making so much money I don't think they give a damn.,0,0

QX6_UViEpOg,Those AC controls are just plain dangerous.  Tiny areas at the very bottom of your screen forcing you to pull your eyes FAR from the road.

You're doing some major steering correction.  I recently test drove a Chevy Bolt and I have to say, I think that'll be my electric of choice.  Interior you can live with, easy to use, small and nimble car.",0,2
QX6_UViEpOg,Is it possible to see in that screen the graphics about charge and discharge (regenerative charge) when you drive? (as in Model S),0,1
QX6_UViEpOg,Great to see this review. Well done! One thing - the center screen seems to have no physical adjustment or tilt - is that correct? It would have been a good idea. There may be cases for some driving positions where the steering wheel obscures the speed reading for example. A simple lateral slider adjustment at the back would be great. Did Tesla include this?,0,1
QX6_UViEpOg,Not a fan of the dash. I'm sorry but basic car controls need to be tactile. The cruise knob does not have a + / - for speed.  You have to do it through the screen..  that's assinine..\nMore dedicated buttons on the steering wheel on front and  or back is the simple answer.\nAnd the screen looks sort of stuck on the dash... Not a great look IMHO.,0,1

QX6_UViEpOg,I genuinely WANT a Tesla III but that big cheap screen looks so terrible.  It literally looks like they mounted a monitor on the dash and removed ALL aspects of aesthetic design.  I know they're going for simplicity but damn.  Install a HUD and bring back the center console screen!  It looked integrated rather than on the fly design with a bolt on monitor.,0,1
QX6_UViEpOg,"Can someone please explain to be the whole Autopilot vs Cruisecontrol. I am confused about the terms. What would be the benefits of paying for the whole system with cameras and everything if I am not allowed to use it. Maybe when Autopilot is approved, the cameras will have to be replaces because the industry have decided a new resolution that the initial Model 3 cameras do not have. . What will be the major differences between Cruise and Auto ? Because as I understand it the Cruise control which is allowed not (correct?) \\n is what I would call autopilot (it keeps you and lane and adapts to speed no??)",0,1
QX6_UViEpOg,The interior fascia of that car is appalling. The look of the steering wheel and controls look like the cheapest Suzuki car we have available here in the UK  costing about £7000.

JudqBA5is6M,"One cannot keep focused any longer. Think about it, there are too many things going on all a one point in time, all the time. \\nThe ratio in America now is 3 to 1. For every 1 logical, hard working person there is now 3 of these irrational, violent, thugs running our streets. These thugs are producing 5 to 1. For every one of our babies we raise, love, and care for they are having 5 how are neglected, beat, and unwanted because we pay for them to do so. STOP!!! REFUSE to pay for welfare any longer. If we do nothing now, by the time our children are our age, this country will look and feel like a third-world. WAKE UP PEOPLE.\\nDo the people even know that the first man to legally own a slave in America was a BLACK man named Anthony Johnson? Look it up people education is everything today. Let us talk about privilege for a moment; As it all stands now, not one white person truly knows what it feels like to take pride in our own race without fear of being persecuted. If a white person is poor we are looked down on as being lazy, with blacks however it is because “racism”.  If a black person has money they are looked up to, but if their white has it then they are “spoon-feed”, or “exploiting others”. If a white commits a violent crime towards blacks they are “racist” and will be prosecuted to the fullest, but if a black against white crime happens it is “justified”. No white person alive “since 1961” has ever known what is like to get hired for a job over another race, because of our skin tone. With ‘affirmative action’ black children can go to private schools for free, but whites must pay, the same thing with colleges, the workforce, etc. When a white person commits a crime it is on every media outlet, but black flash mobs, gruesome murders, and all racist actions are covered by all media outlets. If a white person speaks anything against one's beliefs or makes an insensitive comment they now get fired, persecuted, harassed, and tyrannized. If a black person speaks against someone’s beliefs, and/or makes an insensitive comment nothing negative happens to them, blacks don’t even get called out on it. If and when a black person gets pulled over by the police everyone assumes it because “racism”. A black person can even be pointing a gun at the police, and people say it is because “racism”. If a white man does the same act, they are crazy, stupid, and a criminal. Blacks can, and do blame all their shortcomings on racism. Over 70% of black fathers do not take part in their children’s lives, and the same amount of mothers raise their children to become thugs, from “racism”? Ever since ‘affirmative affirmation’ took place more American have died, than all the U.S. wars combined at the hand of black thugs shooting guns, from “racism”? Anywhere you look on this planet, if the population makes up just 12% or more of the black race violence follows, from “racism”?\\n\\nPeople are so brainwashed by everything they see and hear, even our schools breed “racism” by teaching black victimization, and white privilege. Look up a man named Anthony Johnson and you will see that he was a free black man in America who owned black slaves. Johnson was the first American to even go to court and have his slave documented. Large numbers of free blacks owned some of the biggest plantations in America, which were operated by black slaves that they owned. Did I mention that only 1.4% of all Americans owned slaves? Not one of these facts is mentioned when our children learn about slavery because they want to teach hate. When you get down to it, slavery happened all over the world, to all races. Take a look at the 16th -18th century, it is estimated that 1.5 million Christian Europeans were enslaved in South Africa in the Barbary Slave Trade. Source - http://blog.encyclopediavirginia.org/2011/12/slavery-by-the-numbers/\\nThe media stepped in with their race baiting with Zimmerman, it is also factual that the media showed pictures of Zimmerman as a white man, even went so far as to lighten his pictures, and only showed pictures of  Trayvon from years before the actual incident. Here is the proof in that; https://youtu.be/qfcDIwky8lU\\nObama had a chance to step forward and put a stop to it all, but instead, he got on television, saying Trayvon could have been his son. People are so full of hate that they will not accept these truths. \\nI am telling you, people, we are all being used as sheep, controlled by television, Hollywood, schools, and our government. Who controls all these agendas? $$$$ Wake up, these elites are smart. We have repeated history, and will continue to do so if we do not WAKE UP!!! \\nIf you look into The Bell Curve you will find it scientifically proven that different races have different IQ's no matter where their environment. Yet, we are not allowed to speak about it because it's considered racist. So humanity is being held back and dumbed down. East Asians IQ's are higher than whites, and we can handle that and admit it, yet those who are unintelligent are less logical, more violent, etc..etc.. So these bastards behind the Banking system are feeding these animals white hatred, causing our people to pay for them to not only produce babies, but to make more than us, and they are forcing in millions with these low IQs into only the majority white nations around the world. \\n\\nThe United States alone accepts each year—from 70,000 Refugees in 2015 to 85,000 in 2016 and 100,000 in 2017—and scale up the number of Syrian refugees admitted to at least 10,000 for the current fiscal year, which began October 1. They are spreading them out, so it does not look Biblical. These “Refugees” do not care about our morals and values. They have not come here to help preserve our way of life, nor do they want to contribute positively to our society. We must realize that these people are being placed into any, and only the “majority white” countries around the world. If whites were any other race everyone would be calling this mass-genocide.\\nFollowing all this, if you look into the population in the once majority white nations around the globe compared to this banking system you will see that the banking system is/was doomed, and this is just one reason why we are watching all the immigrants come from these countries around the world. Think about it. If whites were being forced into Africa, so much so that the country's black population was now the minority. This monetary system enslaves us and turns us against one and other. https://youtu.be/mII9NZ8MMVM \\nOn June 4, 1963, Kennedy signed a virtually unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110. This order would strip the Federal Reserve of its power to loan money to the United States Federal Government at interest. November 22, 1963, JFK was assassinated. You all need to wake up and see what’s really going on. This monetary system has caused this. They want whites to be eliminated. They own, promote, and distribute everything we see on television, movies, stores, governments, countries, etc. Look it up, even without all the places this monetary system owns, they still have 99.9% of this planet.\\nJust think about the shows on television now compared to the ones back in the day. The ones back in the days had morals and values, and the shows that play now, like Shameless, project the unhealthy lifestyles to be grandiose. Look back and anyone can see the television has played a major role in society’s behavior. It is our duty to make this country safe for our children and their children. Why are we not uniting? Even our schooling system is spreading identity confusion. A big portion of young people do not even know which sex they are attracted to, and this system caused it all. Back when times were better one family member could work, make enough to take care of the whole house, and one parent could stay home to teach children morals and values to live by. They saw this and modified it. All we must do is unit while we still have the numbers. \\nSince President John F. Kennedy was assassinated in late 1963, more Americans have been killed by gunfire in this country than died in all U.S. wars. Not because of guns, but from black people. I believe it is safe to say it is the majority, and blacks need to stop blaming whites for everything the black race has become. You can look anywhere they are in the world if their numbers are at, or above 12%, Violence follows.\\n\\nThe rules, and principles that are unfairly applied in different ways towards the white people and what they believe in, is not applied in the same manner for any other race in this nation. We must come together and save what those before us have fought and died for, we must unite, taking back what is rightfully ours, our children's, and infinite generations after. Our state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on our way of life, behavior, and political views are now and have been taken away from our people. \\nThis country will not be destroyed by those who do evil, but by those who watch them without doing anything. – M.G.P.",1,2

We follow and obey our Righteous King in our actions and deeds and the world hates us for it, because we don't form ourselves and obey the fallen king of this present world which is Satan):\\n\\n(Jesus):\\n\\nIf the world hates you,\\n\\nye know that\\nit hated me\\nbefore it hated you.\\n\\n(John 15:18).\\n\\n***(Hated Me): The world hated Him, so it should not be surprising that the world hates His followers.\\n\\n***(James 4:4)<---Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.\\n\\n***(1 John 2:15)<---Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\\n\\n***(Luke 6:26)<---Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Build your house with Jesus, on the rock, and you will never sink, that's (IF) we continue to Keep his Commandments, we will bear MUCH FRUIT!):\\n\\n(Jesus):\\n\\nAbide in me,\\nand I in you.\\n\\nAs the branch\\ncannot bear fruit of itself,\\nexcept it abide in the vine;\\n\\nno more can ye,\\nexcept ye abide in me.\\n\\n(John 15:4).\\n\\n***For the branch to produce more fruit, it must abide, which means to dwell, to stay, to settle in, to sink deeper. The way to abide in Christ is to OBEY.\\n\\n***(John 15:10)<---If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.\\n\\n***(1 John 3:24)<---And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.\\n\\n***The believer who lovingly OBEYS the Word of God produces much fruit.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Christ answers Philip, on himself and the Father as One. God manifested in the FLESH!):\\n\\nPhilip saith unto him, Lord,\\n\\nshew us the Father, \\nand it sufficeth us.\\n\\nJesus saith unto him,\\n\\nHave I been so long time with you, \\nand yet hast thou not known me, \\nPhilip?\\n\\nhe that hath seen me \\nhath seen the Father;\\n\\nand how sayest thou then, \\nShew us the Father?\\n\\nBelievest thou not that\\n\\nI am in the Father, \\nand the Father in me?\\n\\nthe words that I speak unto you \\nI speak not of myself:\\nbut (the Father)\\nthat (dwelleth) (in me),\\nhe doeth the works.\\n\\n(John 14:8-10).\\n\\n***(Revelation 21:3)<---And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the (tabernacle of God) is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and (God himself) shall be with them, and (be their God).\\n\\n***(Revelation 1:8)<---(Jesus)<----I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, (((the Almighty))).\\n\\n***The Lord rebuked Philip because he should have known the answer to the question he asked.\\n\\n***(He who has seen Me has seen the Father): The Lord patiently explained again that He was revealing God the Father to them in verse 7. It is impossible to escape the claim Jesus was making. Clearly, He was claiming to be God!\\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\\n\\nJesus said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\\n\\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\\nbut Jesus hid himself, \\nand went out of the temple,\\n\\ngoing through the midst of them, \\nand so passed by.\\n\\n(John 8:58-59).\\n\\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\\n\\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\\n\\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(I AM):\\n\\n(Gk. ego emimi);\\n\\n*(John 6:35)<---And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst).\\n*(John 10:7)<---Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep).\\n*(John 10:14)<---I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine).\\n*(John 15:1)<---I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman).\\n*(John 18:5)<---They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\\n\\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\\n\\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\\n\\nThen answered Jesus \\nand said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \\n\\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\\nfor what things soever he doeth, \\n\\nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\\n\\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\\n\\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \\nand sheweth him all things \\nthat himself doeth:\\n\\nand he will shew him \\ngreater works than these, \\nthat ye may marvel.\\n\\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\\n\\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \\nand quickeneth them; \\neven so the Son quickeneth \\nwhom he will.\\n\\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\\n(John 5:19-21).",0,0

MiQYQQcG1HQ,"Actually I am not supposed to say this; but I work for Amazon and it's true. Yeah they have great benefits, the pay is decent and with all comes a great cost. Every day you are in an Amazon warehouse; they make sure you are there to work, no cell phones are allowed in the building and they make you go through security every break. Which also adds to the fact that you're being heavily watched with cameras at all times, no matter the hallway, corner, shelf, station you are on, they have eyes on you and you can easily get written up for any reason. Customer satisfaction and customer demand for fast packages every day only gets worst as time goes by, every day new internet users are buying more and more and more, and Amazon can't keep up to be honest, hiring people constantly to fill jobs up, sitting is never allowed unless it's during break. They LITERALLY make sure you are worth what they're paying you for a while shift. Not to mention you have to reach limits and number expectations per day, and if you reach them and your shift is not over, you better keep working because the computer tracks every single minute you were not active and if you are inactive for more than 30 minutes on the job, the managers job is to come by and talk to you about it and then decide to wether write you up or fire you. Amazon's expectafions are at an all time high. But somehow Amazon is still such a great place for me to work at and feel like I'm doing something in this world seeing a different package go by to different parts of the world is the best part.",0,0

I do not think it’s worth the prime membership fee just to get free two day shipping because 99% of the time I have to go and stand in line at that sorry as US postal station for two hours just to get my fucking package because they always come to deliver when people are at work and claim they attempted delivery which is not always true.

QX6_UViEpOg,"I wasn't crazy about the single center screen at first, but it's growing on me now that I see it in action. I don't think the interior looks that bad. It's a little on the spartan side -- could use a few more luxurious touches aside from the wood grain to help engagement. A few physical buttons and knobs would help too. And a little more sound-deadening to help reduce tire roar would be appreciated.\\n\\nAll in all, though, nice car. Tesla should do well with these, I think.",0,2
QX6_UViEpOg,Why todays EV designers do the same ergonomic mistakes as designers of early digital cameras??? This touch screen control is the same catastrophy as exposure control on my first digital camera hidden in menu. On car it is even much more dangerous.,1,1

QX6_UViEpOg,I genuinely WANT a Tesla III but that big cheap screen looks so terrible.  It literally looks like they mounted a monitor on the dash and removed ALL aspects of aesthetic design.  I know they're going for simplicity but damn.  Install a HUD and bring back the center console screen!  It looked integrated rather than on the fly design with a bolt on monitor.,0,1
QX6_UViEpOg,"Can someone please explain to be the whole Autopilot vs Cruisecontrol. I am confused about the terms. What would be the benefits of paying for the whole system with cameras and everything if I am not allowed to use it. Maybe when Autopilot is approved, the cameras will have to be replaces because the industry have decided a new resolution that the initial Model 3 cameras do not have. . What will be the major differences between Cruise and Auto ? Because as I understand it the Cruise control which is allowed not (correct?) \\n is what I would call autopilot (it keeps you and lane and adapts to speed no??)",0,1
QX6_UViEpOg,The interior fascia of that car is appalling. The look of the steering wheel and controls look like the cheapest Suzuki car we have available here in the UK  costing about £7000.

And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.\\n\\n***The believer who lovingly OBEYS the Word of God produces much fruit.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Christ answers Philip, on himself and the Father as One. God manifested in the FLESH!):\\n\\nPhilip saith unto him, Lord,\\n\\nshew us the Father, \\nand it sufficeth us.\\n\\nJesus saith unto him,\\n\\nHave I been so long time with you, \\nand yet hast thou not known me, \\nPhilip?\\n\\nhe that hath seen me \\nhath seen the Father;\\n\\nand how sayest thou then, \\nShew us the Father?\\n\\nBelievest thou not that\\n\\nI am in the Father, \\nand the Father in me?\\n\\nthe words that I speak unto you \\nI speak not of myself:\\nbut (the Father)\\nthat (dwelleth) (in me),\\nhe doeth the works.\\n\\n(John 14:8-10).\\n\\n***(Revelation 21:3)<---And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the (tabernacle of God) is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and (God himself) shall be with them, and (be their God).\\n\\n***(Revelation 1:8)<---(Jesus)<----I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, (((the Almighty))).\\n\\n***The Lord rebuked Philip because he should have known the answer to the question he asked.\\n\\n***(He who has seen Me has seen the Father): The Lord patiently explained again that He was revealing God the Father to them in verse 7. It is impossible to escape the claim Jesus was making. Clearly, He was claiming to be God!\\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\\n\\nJesus said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\\n\\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\\nbut Jesus hid himself, \\nand went out of the temple,\\n\\ngoing through the midst of them, \\nand so passed by.\\n\\n(John 8:58-59).\\n\\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\\n\\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\\n\\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(I AM):\\n\\n(Gk. ego emimi);\\n\\n*(John 6:35)<---And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst).\\n*(John 10:7)<---Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep).\\n*(John 10:14)<---I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine).\\n*(John 15:1)<---I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman).\\n*(John 18:5)<---They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\\n\\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\\n\\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\\n\\nThen answered Jesus \\nand said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \\n\\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\\nfor what things soever he doeth, \\n\\nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\\n\\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\\n\\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \\nand sheweth him all things \\nthat himself doeth:\\n\\nand he will shew him \\ngreater works than these, \\nthat ye may marvel.\\n\\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\\n\\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \\nand quickeneth them; \\neven so the Son quickeneth \\nwhom he will.\\n\\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\\n(John 5:19-21).",0,0

MiQYQQcG1HQ,I work at Walmart and the reason why they are not on top of Amazon is because they are not innovative at all,0,0
MiQYQQcG1HQ,"Actually I am not supposed to say this; but I work for Amazon and it's true. Yeah they have great benefits, the pay is decent and with all comes a great cost. Every day you are in an Amazon warehouse; they make sure you are there to work, no cell phones are allowed in the building and they make you go through security every break. Which also adds to the fact that you're being heavily watched with cameras at all times, no matter the hallway, corner, shelf, station you are on, they have eyes on you and you can easily get written up for any reason. Customer satisfaction and customer demand for fast packages every day only gets worst as time goes by, every day new internet users are buying more and more and more, and Amazon can't keep up to be honest, hiring people constantly to fill jobs up, sitting is never allowed unless it's during break. They LITERALLY make sure you are worth what they're paying you for a while shift. Not to mention you have to reach limits and number expectations per day, and if you reach them and your shift is not over, you better keep working because the computer tracks every single minute you were not active and if you are inactive for more than 30 minutes on the job, the managers job is to come by and talk to you about it and then decide to wether write you up or fire you. Amazon's expectafions are at an all time high. But somehow Amazon is still such a great place for me to work at and feel like I'm doing something in this world seeing a different package go by to different parts of the world is the best part.",0,0
