3qVHkOOyD5s,"Does Demi not understand that you have to have dynamic, its so unnecessary to do all of that shouty throaty singing at the start of a song, so poorly executed, I've loved Demi for years, met her plenty of times and she literally has had a huge impact on my life, but these days she's become a bit of a vocal show off like Christina Aguilera...think about when Christina did 'Say Something' it was so much more impactful because for once she wasn't screaming. idk someone has to get me here.",6,2

bAon04ZJhHE,"Hopefully they go back to what made south park great. Finding something to make fun of, doing that, and moving on. The story style got old quick. It was fine in aspects like Imagination Land etc. but the election and PC story line got old quick and they kept milking it all season. That's why I'm worried even with this commercial. Yeah make fun of the race war going on over people's feelings being hurt over a flag but then stop after that and move on. Don't devote an entire season to it.",0,0

bAon04ZJhHE,"When you have to explain the joke of White People Renovating Houses, then it's poor writing to begin with. Why can't South Park just bash the hell out of Hillary? So many material there. The mainstream media are all bashing Trump, so it'd be refreshing and therefore funny to see new material on Hillary, book tour, narcissism, blaming game, Russia hysteria, conspiracies, pizza gate, legitimate news like CNN going after a Reddit user, going after kids, stalking kids, threatening kids, news are now about kids and what they tweet, and personal opinions are considered news now, etc. South Park used to go against the mainstream and didn't care about the mainstream's self-entitled importance and made fun of them; now, it seems like South Park is trying to make a moral stance, like Kyle's end-of-episode speeches, instead of being about comedy. Trump (allegedly) broke Kathy Griffin, and now, apparently South Park too. That Kathy Griffin's bloody head of Trump like ISISvideo could have been a new material and storyline too for comedy. And Alec Baldwin publicly comforting Kathy Griffin and others who have threatened Trump's death like there's an Alec Baldwin support group for presidential assassinations now",0,0

I watch your cakes every Tuesday and I won't miss them ever. Since I watched your pancake cake which was your first one. This channel been my favorite one out of Rossana Pansino, IJustine, and MyCupcake Addition. My favorites cakes are the peanut butter and chocolate cake, this one, the cookie cake with Mr. Friday I forget his name, the football cake because I love the Eagles in NFL, I liked the nachos cake because Chet was being silly and funny. The spinner cake is one of my favorites because I love spinners. I love the animal and emoji cakes because I love animals and I love emoji cakes. I cant believe you took 4 days on this its so amazing and you should make all of the ninjas because they look like they are real in real life. I so wish I could go to Canada and meet u in real life. You are my inspiration because ive been always cooking with my grandma and helping my mom and knce I saw these cakes I want to make them and make them awesome just like you do and u are. I love when you make a (not to be mean)  lame jokes and Joslin (don't know how to spell it) makes her laugh and Jeremy just standing there being like why am I here. I wish I could do camp cake u always had and maybe still will but I'm very sad I can't to do. I'm so glad I got to say this to u on here because you are amazing so much to me and to the whole world. I even follow you on Facebook and if I could get on my Instagram i would follow you sadly I can't because I forget it. If I could pre-order your book because if you say there amazing then they would be awesome to make but I can't and im disappointed I cant. If you love this whole message because this came from my heart please shout out me because I would love that. Cant wait to see your next cake and wonder what its gonna be. If you could can you try or do a Husky cake because I love them and they are my favorite animals. Sadly I cant be a VIP either. Have a wonderful day. #Cake Squad#.",0,0

When I'm talking to other LGBTQ+ people I'll just refer to myself as queer but if I'm talking to a cishet person I'll tell them I IDENTIFY as queer, just so they don't go around thinking that the slur is okay for them to use, and so when they refer to me they can say, Oh she identifies as queer instead of, She's queer.

I'm using the currect form of the word in its original definition but I would never want to offend a stranger by saying it.,0,0

3qVHkOOyD5s,"Why is Demi trying too much to show that she has a powerful voice? Same happened in the National Anthem and it didn't work. She needs to show control and not belt out every single note, it doesn't make justice to her voice...",10,8
3qVHkOOyD5s,"Does Demi not understand that you have to have dynamic, its so unnecessary to do all of that shouty throaty singing at the start of a song, so poorly executed, I've loved Demi for years, met her plenty of times and she literally has had a huge impact on my life, but these days she's become a bit of a vocal show off like Christina Aguilera...think about when Christina did 'Say Something' it was so much more impactful because for once she wasn't screaming. idk someone has to get me here.",16,4
3qVHkOOyD5s,Demi has never had the blended type voice so I understand lowering her a little because her voice is so powerful but this was way too quiet,0,0

3qVHkOOyD5s,"I'm seeing a lot of people question why Demi's mic was so low, & it could've been done that way to appease the other singers (ie: Cece Winans, etc). I remember years ago on a VH1 Divas Special, Mariah Carey & Diana Ross did a duet: it was said that Ross forbade Carey from doing her trademark whistles, out of fear of being overshadowing. Could be something similar? :/",1,1
3qVHkOOyD5s,"The thought that kept wandering in my head was If this girl fucks this song up bruh....I swear LOL! But she didn't, and she had some kind of restraint. But that may have been due to mic issues. If so, it saved the song, 'cause it prohibited her from doing the most as she usually does xD",0,0
3qVHkOOyD5s,They couldn't do auto tune for her - so they subtlety turned down her volume. That why she should stick to auto tune.,0,1

I've never been called that (thankfully) so I don't feel like I have a 'right' to use the word. The word  isn't mine to 'take back' because it was never mine to begin with. If that makes sense?

bAon04ZJhHE,After watching the new episode.... I can say south park is dead! For fuck sake; what happened guys.,3,0
bAon04ZJhHE,The episode for the new season was OK but kind of confusing at the very end with Daryl. I hope since now Cartman has broken up with Heidi Cartman would go back to what made him such a great character in the first place.,3,0
bAon04ZJhHE,This episode was hilarious. Randy is one of South Park's best characters! :) \nGod bless Matt Stone and Trey Parker.,0,0
bAon04ZJhHE,"South Park- Season 21- Plot for ‘The Cartman Society’\\n\\nOne day, Mayor McDaniels is looking rather anxious; the life of a mayor in charge of a quiet little white-bred, redneck mountain town is hard work. She tells her secretary that she needs a break. More than a break actually; a getaway. She then tells him to run over to ‘Tweek Bros. Coffee’ and get her an extra-strong coffee and a Danish. While he’s gone, Mayor McDaniels jumps out the window and takes a bus out of town. The secretary returns with the Coffee and Danish, only to find that the mayor isn’t present.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Cartman is playing on his Xbox One when Liane gets a phone call from the head of the PTA, Sheila Broflovski. She tells Liane to come to the Community Centre for an emergency meeting. At the community center, Sheila and Randy call for order; tonight’s topic is on the disappearance of Mayor McDaniels. Linda Stotch claims that without the mayor, the town’s society will collapse. Roger Donovan says that the mayor’s disappearance has never happened before. Stuart McCormick says they should search for the mayor, only for Laura Tucker to say they should elect a new mayor. The PTA then holds a vote; ‘Look for the Mayor’ beats ‘elect a new mayor’.\\n\\nThat night, the parents tell the children they’ll be out of town for a few days; Sheila and Gerald promise that Kyle will take good care of Ike while they’re gone. They get onto a bus, and are soon out of town. The children watch them leave, and Cartman asks why they’re leaving. Craig tells them that apparently, they’re searching for Mayor McDaniels. Cartman sees this as an opportunity to do something he’s been wanting to do for a long time; be in charge of the whole town.\\n\\nThe next day, Cartman is now the mayor of South Park; his girlfriend, Heidi, is his secretary, and his bodyguards are Tweek and Craig. Heidi informs him that three people are here to see him. The three people are Stan, Kyle and Wendy, who disapprove of Cartman being the mayor. Stan tells Cartman to let Wendy be mayor, as she makes good decisions, unlike Cartman. Cartman says “Are you disrespecting my authoritah?”. He orders Tweek and Craig to kick them out. Kyle says that Cartman won’t get away with this.\\n\\nThat evening, Cartman holds his first mayoral meeting at the community center. His first item is giving a few people titles. First up, is Wendy Testaburger as “Biggest Bitch” He then proceeds to sing Wendy is a Bitch, to the tune of Kyle’s Mom is a Bitch. Just as the song ends, Wendy storms in, punches Cartman in the face and kicks him in the balls, then leaves. Cartman calls for police officers Butters and Kenny to arrest her, as well as Kyle and Stan. Cartman continues with the list, up to ‘Stupidest Jew’.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the PTA have arrived in Denver. It is nearly impossible to find Mayor McDaniels in the bustling city. They ask random people if they’ve seen her by holding up a picture, but no-one has. They go to the station and ask the guy at the front if he’s seen a woman who looks like Mayor McDaniels. He says her train departed to Salt Lake City about 5 hours ago. The PTA are at the station, waiting for the next train to Salt Lake City.\\n\\nBack in South Park, Kyle, Stan and Wendy are thrown into their cell. Kyle believes it is over; Cartman has won. Then, they see a few other prisoners, most notably, but not limited to, Shelley Marsh and Scott Tenorman, who tell them not to give up on hope. They tell them that Cartman ordered for them to be arrested, and has taken over the whole town. They are part of a rebellion, intent on taking down Cartman, they were sent to spy on him, but got caught and arrested by Butters and Kenny. Stan, Kyle and Wendy tell Shelley and Scott they have a plan to bring down Cartman.\\n\\nIn the middle of the night, when Butters and Kenny are asleep, the cell is busted open by Bebe and a few members of the rebellion. Stan, Kyle, Wendy, Shelley and Scott follow them to Starks Pond, where the rebellion has set up a base. The rebellion celebrate the return of Shelley and Scott, and welcome Stan, Kyle and Wendy into the rebellion. They are seated in front of a fire, and Bebe tells them they are organized to fight Cartman. Kyle tells her that Cartman isn’t willing to give up the position. They run through their plan on bringing down Cartman. First of all, they’ll use Timmy’s wheelchair as a battering ram to get into the city hall, then Clyde and Token will distract Tweek and Craig, and while Wendy keeps Heidi occupied, Stan and Kyle will confront Cartman.\\n\\nOver in Utah, the PTA has arrived in Salt Lake City. They are continuing their search for Mayor McDaniels, but by now, most of the PTA want to go home, but Sheila isn’t willing to give up on their search. They decide the best place to find Mayor McDaniels is in one of the apartments. They try the first apartment, and get her room number. They knock on the door, and sure enough, they see her, drinking alcohol heavily and watching Terrance and Phillip. Randy tells her she needs to come back to South Park, as the whole town may be in chaos. After some thinking, she finally decides to return to South Park.\\n\\nBack in South Park, the rebellion has infiltrated the city hall. Stan and Kyle engage Cartman, and he attacks Kyle, pinning him to the ground. Stan shakes him off, but Cartman calls in Tweek and Craig, who attack Stan, separating him from Kyle. Cartman threatens Kyle with being turned into Chilli, just as Scott Tenorman, Wendy and the rebellion show up, armed with paintball guns. Seeing as he is outnumbered, Cartman surrenders, so do Heidi, Tweek, Craig, Butters and Kenny. Stan and Kyle order for them to be thrown into jail, and Wendy is elected as the new mayor of South Park.\\n\\nTwo days later, the PTA is back with Mayor McDaniels. She opens her office, only to find some debris here and there. Officer Barbrady goes to the police station, and sees various kids locked up, notably Cartman, Kenny and Butters, as well as Heidi, Tweek and Craig. He releases them, then he and Mayor McDaniels restore order to the town. Gerald asks how long they were out of town, to which Sheila replies “A Week”.\\n\\nThe boys are glad that Mayor McDaniels is back. Kyle says that he learnt something from that whole experience; don’t go mad with power. Mr Mackey reminds them that school has started back up again. The boys groan, so they and the other students bombard Mr Mackey with paintballs.",0,0

bAon04ZJhHE,"When you have to explain the joke of White People Renovating Houses, then it's poor writing to begin with. Why can't South Park just bash the hell out of Hillary? So many material there. The mainstream media are all bashing Trump, so it'd be refreshing and therefore funny to see new material on Hillary, book tour, narcissism, blaming game, Russia hysteria, conspiracies, pizza gate, legitimate news like CNN going after a Reddit user, going after kids, stalking kids, threatening kids, news are now about kids and what they tweet, and personal opinions are considered news now, etc. South Park used to go against the mainstream and didn't care about the mainstream's self-entitled importance and made fun of them; now, it seems like South Park is trying to make a moral stance, like Kyle's end-of-episode speeches, instead of being about comedy. Trump (allegedly) broke Kathy Griffin, and now, apparently South Park too. That Kathy Griffin's bloody head of Trump like ISISvideo could have been a new material and storyline too for comedy. And Alec Baldwin publicly comforting Kathy Griffin and others who have threatened Trump's death like there's an Alec Baldwin support group for presidential assassinations now",1,0

But everytime I listen to Out Loud, I feel like crying not just because I understand the pain behind the words but because I just feel so much sense of overwhelming happiness for you. You are doing so many great things the year alone. I remember the begining of the year you doing the things that scared you like stand up and going on tour and now your book is out and you have this amazing song and I just feel some much joy in my heart for you. I do hope you extend your book tour to Kansas or Missouri so I can tell you all of this to your face because I know this will get lost in the Internet and you won't see see it but i had to put it out in the world to let my friends and family see just how amazing you are and so they see how much talent is out there yet to be discovered. I hope you see this Gabbie Hanna I love you and i am so proud of everything great you are doing and when you fall you get right back up. Just keep being you. Xoxo",0,0

I think that she is just such an incredible person to look up to and she pushes me to just keep trying things. I am beyond thrilled that she is so happy now and can we just take a minute to talk about how dang good she looks!! She's just beaming and it's incredible.

iIYXR4axaJY,"Gab, not sure if you'll end up seeing this, but I wanted to try and reach out to you and share a conversation my mom and I had today.\\n\\nI'm from your hometown, actually I'm pretty sure you graduated with one of my cousins. You're a few years older than me, and I weirdly always thought you looked so familiar. It was always comforting which is probably why I'm such a strong supporter of yours.\\n\\nAnyway, my mom, my brother, and I were at dinner tonight. I live away from home so I don't get to do as much rambling to them as I used to, and your song popped into my head so I told my mom about you and how successful you are and how you made it out of our shitty little town full of, well, nothing good (but family). You get it. \\n\\nWhen I said your last name my moms mouth fell open and said The family that went to our church?!? And with that everything automatically clicked. I KNEW I knew you. My mom knows of you very well it seems. I was too young to remember much, but certain memories and images have resurfaced.\\n\\nMy mom was silent for a minute and finally said Well, God Bless her. She was always the type to be so caring and great with her siblings. She went on to praise you and I became overwhelmed with joy for you. It's so hard to make it out of the place we come from, especially make it BIG. I've tried, and failed for the time being. But you did it and I'm so so proud. Don't let anyone bring you down, from home, from the Internet, anywhere. You fucking did it girl, and you deserve every fucking thing you get. I love you!!! I hope you see this. So many people are rooting for you and everything you've accomplished is so fucking inspiring to me and many others! Continue to not let fame change you!!! Xoxo",0,0

What we're sick of -- and I think I speak for all of us -- are channels like Looper, Buzzfeed, Watchmojo - that ilk - who offer up little but useless gossip and bland filler. You on the other hand really add to folk's viewing pleasure by showing them something worth knowing; a better way to watch movies. Your round table thing usually falls flat tho -- a snappy script is a deal maker for channels like yours, and you lot have some of the best. You're heavy hitters, no sense stepping out of the wheelhouse.",0,0

TV2HTSV3w40,"This is absolutely the one movie I think they could remake quite easily if they tried...\\n\\nFirst off, it's built into the narrative: The Grandfather says at the beginning of the film how this story has been read down through the generations, so just get Fred Savage to come back and finally get around to reading it to his kids.  Boom, not a remake, just a pseudo-sequel.\\n\\nSecondly, since he's reading it to his kids, he's gonna have to update the narrative for his pain-in-the-ass millennial brats (note the plural; I say there are at least two kids, boy and girl, maybe even more) who can't handle the cheesiness and slower pace of the older material (passive-aggressively addressing those in the audience who _can't stand_ the original movie). Again, kinda built into the narrative with the Grandfather sort-of changing the story a bit as he goes in order to keep the Grandson interested.\\n\\nAnd thirdly, this film is such a beloved Goddamned new Hollywood classic, there is _no way_ the studio would't throw all the support necessary into it's development.  And there isn't a talent working in the industry today who wouldn't be willing to bend over backwards to have a part in retelling this film, but better this time.  And I resolutely refuse to believe anyone in Hollywood today would dare release a remake/retelling of this one without it being fucking _perfect._\\n\\nFourth, there is a wealth of talent in Hollywood at this exact moment in time that I can really see this production working out.  Just the casting alone is a fun exercise.  \\n\\nImagine Christoph Waltz as Count Rugen!  \\n\\nOr Chris Hemsworth as Humperdink.  \\n\\nAntonio Banderas as Inigo Montoya?  \\n\\nWill Arnet as Vizzini perhaps?  Or Ricky Gervais would be good, too.  \\n\\nThe Rock is an obvious choice for Fezzik, but I think Robert Maillet (the Big Guy from Sherlock Holmes '09) as Fezzik would be great. \\n\\nThe only hiccups I'm coming up with are the two leads, Westley and Buttercup.  Lots of good choices out there, though.",0,0

TV2HTSV3w40,"This is absolutely the one movie I think they could remake quite easily if they tried...\\n\\nFirst off, it's built into the narrative: The Grandfather says at the beginning of the film how this story has been read down through the generations, so just get Fred Savage to come back and finally get around to reading it to his kids.  Boom, not a remake, just a pseudo-sequel.\\n\\nSecondly, since he's reading it to his kids, he's gonna have to update the narrative for his pain-in-the-ass millennial brats (note the plural; I say there are at least two kids, boy and girl, maybe even more) who can't handle the cheesiness and slower pace of the older material (passive-aggressively addressing those in the audience who _can't stand_ the original movie). Again, kinda built into the narrative with the Grandfather sort-of changing the story a bit as he goes in order to keep the Grandson interested.\\n\\nAnd thirdly, this film is such a beloved Goddamned new Hollywood classic, there is _no way_ the studio would't throw all the support necessary into it's development.  And there isn't a talent working in the industry today who wouldn't be willing to bend over backwards to have a part in retelling this film, but better this time.  And I resolutely refuse to believe anyone in Hollywood today would dare release a remake/retelling of this one without it being fucking _perfect._\\n\\nFourth, there is a wealth of talent in Hollywood at this exact moment in time that I can really see this production working out.  Just the casting alone is a fun exercise.  \\n\\nImagine Christoph Waltz as Count Rugen!  \\n\\nOr Chris Hemsworth as Humperdink.  \\n\\nAntonio Banderas as Inigo Montoya?  \\n\\nWill Arnet as Vizzini perhaps?  Or Ricky Gervais would be good, too.  \\n\\nThe Rock is an obvious choice for Fezzik, but I think Robert Maillet (the Big Guy from Sherlock Holmes '09) as Fezzik would be great. \\n\\nThe only hiccups I'm coming up with are the two leads, Westley and Buttercup.  Lots of good choices out there, though.",0,0

TV2HTSV3w40,"This is absolutely the one movie I think they could remake quite easily if they tried...\\n\\nFirst off, it's built into the narrative: The Grandfather says at the beginning of the film how this story has been read down through the generations, so just get Fred Savage to come back and finally get around to reading it to his kids.  Boom, not a remake, just a pseudo-sequel.\\n\\nSecondly, since he's reading it to his kids, he's gonna have to update the narrative for his pain-in-the-ass millennial brats (note the plural; I say there are at least two kids, boy and girl, maybe even more) who can't handle the cheesiness and slower pace of the older material (passive-aggressively addressing those in the audience who _can't stand_ the original movie). Again, kinda built into the narrative with the Grandfather sort-of changing the story a bit as he goes in order to keep the Grandson interested.\\n\\nAnd thirdly, this film is such a beloved Goddamned new Hollywood classic, there is _no way_ the studio would't throw all the support necessary into it's development.  And there isn't a talent working in the industry today who wouldn't be willing to bend over backwards to have a part in retelling this film, but better this time.  And I resolutely refuse to believe anyone in Hollywood today would dare release a remake/retelling of this one without it being fucking _perfect._\\n\\nFourth, there is a wealth of talent in Hollywood at this exact moment in time that I can really see this production working out.  Just the casting alone is a fun exercise.  \\n\\nImagine Christoph Waltz as Count Rugen!  \\n\\nOr Chris Hemsworth as Humperdink.  \\n\\nAntonio Banderas as Inigo Montoya?  \\n\\nWill Arnet as Vizzini perhaps?  Or Ricky Gervais would be good, too.  \\n\\nThe Rock is an obvious choice for Fezzik, but I think Robert Maillet (the Big Guy from Sherlock Holmes '09) as Fezzik would be great. \\n\\nThe only hiccups I'm coming up with are the two leads, Westley and Buttercup.  Lots of good choices out there, though.",0,0

-jFgNreZPf0,"So everyone is complaining about new Asking Alexandria cause it's different. It's a thing called evolution, if a band releases the same bland metalcore over and over again, everyone gets tired of it. My problem with old Asking Alexandria is in Stand Up and Scream, the drums were sample city, and Danny's vocals were auto tuned to shit. Also the song titles were shit. Reckless and Relentless wasn't bad, but was still kinda meh because Danny's vocals were just really boring to listen to. Also the riffing and writing weren't anything special. From Death to Destiny's mixing was meh, the drums were sample city, but the vocals are amazing and the writing is better. The Black had terrible mixing and terrible writing. This has good writing, well done mixing, great vocals, though the chorus is a little bland with Danny just singing Into The Fire multiple times. Other than that, great song.",1,0

TV2HTSV3w40,"This is absolutely the one movie I think they could remake quite easily if they tried...\\n\\nFirst off, it's built into the narrative: The Grandfather says at the beginning of the film how this story has been read down through the generations, so just get Fred Savage to come back and finally get around to reading it to his kids.  Boom, not a remake, just a pseudo-sequel.\\n\\nSecondly, since he's reading it to his kids, he's gonna have to update the narrative for his pain-in-the-ass millennial brats (note the plural; I say there are at least two kids, boy and girl, maybe even more) who can't handle the cheesiness and slower pace of the older material (passive-aggressively addressing those in the audience who _can't stand_ the original movie). Again, kinda built into the narrative with the Grandfather sort-of changing the story a bit as he goes in order to keep the Grandson interested.\\n\\nAnd thirdly, this film is such a beloved Goddamned new Hollywood classic, there is _no way_ the studio would't throw all the support necessary into it's development.  And there isn't a talent working in the industry today who wouldn't be willing to bend over backwards to have a part in retelling this film, but better this time.  And I resolutely refuse to believe anyone in Hollywood today would dare release a remake/retelling of this one without it being fucking _perfect._\\n\\nFourth, there is a wealth of talent in Hollywood at this exact moment in time that I can really see this production working out.  Just the casting alone is a fun exercise.  \\n\\nImagine Christoph Waltz as Count Rugen!  \\n\\nOr Chris Hemsworth as Humperdink.  \\n\\nAntonio Banderas as Inigo Montoya?  \\n\\nWill Arnet as Vizzini perhaps?  Or Ricky Gervais would be good, too.  \\n\\nThe Rock is an obvious choice for Fezzik, but I think Robert Maillet (the Big Guy from Sherlock Holmes '09) as Fezzik would be great. \\n\\nThe only hiccups I'm coming up with are the two leads, Westley and Buttercup.  Lots of good choices out there, though.",0,0

I know some are afraid of change and hate it when their favorite bands try something out, I mean, god forbid right? Sarcasm. Sometimes you gotta quit being scared that something new won't be good because you don't know unless you try.

James Corden makes fun of his weight and James Corden is a bit overweight but far from obese, like Kevin James and 'The Fresh Prince Of Belair,' Uncle Phil who actually had to gain the weight to play Uncle Phil.  He is now deceased.  Christian Bale lost a whole man's body weight for 'The Machinist.'  Terribly thin, as did, Matthew M., and Jared Leto.  The actress who plays Brigette and is fully American, learned to speak in a U.K. accent, gained 40 lbs., (I never saw the movie's), the one that had Tom Cruise at 'Hello,' her name escapes my memory at this moment, Renee Zellweger, gained and lost weight and was thinner each time.  I completely understand it's about the money they are paid... oh yeah, Tom Hanks and the Wilson ball when the Fed Ex 'movie' plane crashed, 'Castaway,' and in 'Philadelphia,' playing an AIDS lawyer who sued because he was fired due to the disease, and Hanks went on to winning an Academy Award for his role.

RxIh_0q524c,"👑Princess Alodia Almira Latest Vlog Comments: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iAQaxok_O8\\n\\nEvery vlog that you uploaded makes me smile @alodiaalmira it reminds me everytime that you are still what you are as being the Princess that your Dad wants to see! the spirit of #Princess Alodia Almira 👑 is still there everytime you #Cosplay.  Well you begin to dream as a Cosplayer and at the very end you'll also and always be a Cosplayer whatever happens in the future.. You know i dreamed also to become like you @alodiaalmira if only those opportunity and those destiny that has given to me went to success? Baka kasama na kita nuon pa last 7 yrs since year 2010 but things went smoother.. Because i made a wrong turn, or wrong decision in every time line, in every opportunity that comes along the way for 7 yrs or early than that we say 14 yrs since 2003. But that was all in the past.. So enough of excuses for me. The important is i am still alive and still fighting to make my dreams come true. Well I've heard this promise over many times by different people out there Action Speaks Louder Than Words I agree it is true. If other successful people apply this #principles to fulfill their dreams and their destiny. Why not me? I have waiting to make my Technology fruitful for 27 yrs since 1990 why not try to take risk and give all my best shot this year 2017? If the phoenix of #HarryPotter power is real, then if i have that similarities of Destiny why do try? And work hard to show to everyone that i am Useful and Helpful to the people especially the #poorpeople around the World? Then why not? Guys and @AlodiaAlmira. I've realize that there's no more time to hide i think it's for me to shine~! So please don't cursed me on past comments that I've post, peoples change so i am also can change! Help me don't take me down. 👽🙏\\n\\nBtw. I've made a Prayer for you all~ \\n\\nOur Father - God Almighty is an eternally creative and active recycling entity in a realm that extends from nothingness to all things whatsoever without exception. In short he is everything there is that Man can perceive and all those beyond his imagination forever. \\n\\nThis being the case, It becomes our duty to discover in this seemingly chaotic environment - the realities which are beneficial to us, Our Father provides his own body and soul with all things needed for survival - being a part of him we only have to find what we need. They are there for the taking, the bees know this from the flowers; the cattle from the grasses; the apes from the fruits; the rest from the nutrients of others and the soil to which they return.\\n\\nEventually, our physical constituency disperse to be part of others Ad-Infinitum. The soul is an enigma, it is consciousness of one's ego held together by Spiritual Energy, Man will never understand. But our Father gave man the ability to invent through Science Engineering, Technology and Philosophy.\\n\\nIn the meantime, that we do not understand what a soul is, let us record our constituency and consciousness in our Computers, to be stored, preserved and reconstituted back into our own selves, at some future time at our discretion, let us create our own Heaven where we can Live For All Eternity. ✨\\n\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/notes/g-buoy-frigillana/creating-our-own-heaven-/400811423614621/",0,0

ZaB6kENkGVg,Princess and The Frog is a GREAT movie. I'm happy with it's placement but in my personal list it would be much higher. Top 10 or 5. Fantasia was way  too high. It's a boring awful movie with only maybe two good parts.,0,0

Set in a country somewhere we rarely see in a movie, and make its culture part of film's appeal. Invent a brand-new film aesthetic where the background can look as beautiful as the original and not be jarring. The original created a new look for animated movies, and they should commit to do the same, or I cannot support it in any way. Anyways, thanks for bringing it up on the show!",0,0

The twist and turns are just the cherry on top of a chocolate cake. So no hollywood,  i'll stick to Makoto Shinkai's original version even if  JJ Abrams is making it. The only reason its not well known in the U.S. is because americans think theyre too cool to watch anime.",0,0
ZaB6kENkGVg,"Drew Taylor from Collider appreciate what you did but I don't agree with your list. Sleeping Beauty at Number 2 over Aladdin, Beauty And The Beast, and Lion King. Wreck It Ralph and Zootopia should be higher. The Fox And The Hound at Number 55! I love that movie. And I don't get why Moana is loved so much and it doesn't deserve Number 9. I'm happy to have a strong female character in a movie but the movie is just okay. The music is fine but I personally preferred the music in Frozen and Tangled more. Also her rooster sidekick is dumb and adds nothing to the movie And the movie lacks a great villain. Hope Collider does a fan poll and Collider video does their own version. Film is subjective and I would like to see their take on the subject.",0,0
ZaB6kENkGVg,"I feel the Disney animated films that would need to be in a top 5 (Not necessarily in this order) are:\\n- Snow White: First feature Animated film, wouldn't have any others without it.\\n- Fantasia: I get it's not for everybody but there really isn't another film like it. I feel it's a work of art.\\n- Cinderella: Probably the most famous Princess film ever.\\n- Beauty and the Beast: Only animated film to be nominated for Best Picture in the 5-film era.\\n- Lion King: Probably along with Beauty as the most important Disney animated film of the 90s.\\n\\nBut again it's subjective.",0,0

ZaB6kENkGVg,"I don't wanna see a whitewashed Your Name (nor Akira) if it happens which I have a strong feeling it will (because 90% of the time that's what they mean when it's labeled as an American version), do Hollywood not realize Asians live in America too? Just cast Asian-Americans, do research on the culture and try your best to pay homage to the source material while still adding a lil' bit of your own artistic vision to it; so simple. If you're gonna make a Western version of it, at least cast Asian-Americans.\\n\\nImo, we shouldn't have to always water-down and 'westernize' a film/culture for it to be embraced by an American audience, instead we should learn to embrace other cultures, their art, stories, etc. in its source nature.\\n\\nI'll only accept a live-action _AKIRA_ only if they base it in a beautiful futuristic Neo-Tokyo and handle it with the same amount of care, research, and respect as Disney/Marvel are currently doing with Black Panther.\\n\\nMy Top 15 (6-15 may change) Disney animated films are:\\n\\n1. The Lion King\\n2. Hercules\\n3. Lilo & Stitch\\n4. Pocahantas\\n5. The Lion King II\\n6. Toy Story\\n7. The Princess and the Frog\\n8. Aladdin\\n9. Brother Bear\\n10. Mulan\\n11.

RxIh_0q524c,"👑Princess Alodia Almira Latest Vlog Comments: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iAQaxok_O8\\n\\nEvery vlog that you uploaded makes me smile @alodiaalmira it reminds me everytime that you are still what you are as being the Princess that your Dad wants to see! the spirit of #Princess Alodia Almira 👑 is still there everytime you #Cosplay.  Well you begin to dream as a Cosplayer and at the very end you'll also and always be a Cosplayer whatever happens in the future.. You know i dreamed also to become like you @alodiaalmira if only those opportunity and those destiny that has given to me went to success? Baka kasama na kita nuon pa last 7 yrs since year 2010 but things went smoother.. Because i made a wrong turn, or wrong decision in every time line, in every opportunity that comes along the way for 7 yrs or early than that we say 14 yrs since 2003. But that was all in the past.. So enough of excuses for me. The important is i am still alive and still fighting to make my dreams come true. Well I've heard this promise over many times by different people out there Action Speaks Louder Than Words I agree it is true. If other successful people apply this #principles to fulfill their dreams and their destiny. Why not me? I have waiting to make my Technology fruitful for 27 yrs since 1990 why not try to take risk and give all my best shot this year 2017? If the phoenix of #HarryPotter power is real, then if i have that similarities of Destiny why do try? And work hard to show to everyone that i am Useful and Helpful to the people especially the #poorpeople around the World? Then why not? Guys and @AlodiaAlmira. I've realize that there's no more time to hide i think it's for me to shine~! So please don't cursed me on past comments that I've post, peoples change so i am also can change! Help me don't take me down. 👽🙏\\n\\nBtw. I've made a Prayer for you all~ \\n\\nOur Father - God Almighty is an eternally creative and active recycling entity in a realm that extends from nothingness to all things whatsoever without exception. In short he is everything there is that Man can perceive and all those beyond his imagination forever. \\n\\nThis being the case, It becomes our duty to discover in this seemingly chaotic environment - the realities which are beneficial to us, Our Father provides his own body and soul with all things needed for survival - being a part of him we only have to find what we need. They are there for the taking, the bees know this from the flowers; the cattle from the grasses; the apes from the fruits; the rest from the nutrients of others and the soil to which they return.\\n\\nEventually, our physical constituency disperse to be part of others Ad-Infinitum. The soul is an enigma, it is consciousness of one's ego held together by Spiritual Energy, Man will never understand. But our Father gave man the ability to invent through Science Engineering, Technology and Philosophy.\\n\\nIn the meantime, that we do not understand what a soul is, let us record our constituency and consciousness in our Computers, to be stored, preserved and reconstituted back into our own selves, at some future time at our discretion, let us create our own Heaven where we can Live For All Eternity. ✨\\n\\nhttps://www.facebook.com/notes/g-buoy-frigillana/creating-our-own-heaven-/400811423614621/",0,0

Gaddafi’s father died while him, his wife and his mother were still living in a tent.\\n\\n- All newlyweds in Libya receive $60,000 Dinar (US$50,000) by the government to buy their first apartment so to help start up the family.\\n\\n- Education and medical treatments are free in Libya. Before Gaddafi only 25% of Libyans were literate. Today the figure is 83%.\\n\\n- Should Libyans want to take up farming careers, they would receive farming land, a farming house, equipments, seeds and livestock to kick-start their farms – all for free.\\n\\n- If Libyans cannot find the education or medical facilities they need in Libya, the government funds them to go abroad for it – not only free, but they also get US$2,300/month for accommodation and car allowance.\\n\\n- If a Libyan buys a new car from Libya, the government subsidized 50% of the price.\\n\\n- The price of petrol in Libya is only $0.14 per liter.\\n\\n- Libya has no external debt and its reserves amount to $150 billion – now frozen globally.\\n\\n- If a Libyan is unable to get employment after graduation, the state would pay the average salary of the profession as if he or she is employed, until employment is found.\\n\\n- A portion of Libyan oil sale is credited directly to the bank accounts of all Libyan citizens.\\n\\n- A mother who gives birth to a child receives US$5,000 ;\\n\\n- 40 loaves of bread in Libya costs only $0.15.\\n\\n- 25% of Libyans have a University degree.\\n\\n- Gaddafi carried out the world’s largest irrigation project, known as the Great Man-Made River project, to make water readily available throughout the desert country. The water is free of charge.\\n\\n- Prior to the international sanction placed on Gaddafi & Libya in the 1980s, the country was one of the richest in the world by GDP per capita– with a living standard higher than Japan. It was the richest in Africa before the revolution. The living standard – GDP per capita is $11,314 for Libya. One cannot claim the Libyans are poor if they live better than many of the Western citizens. Gaddafi always looked after the average Libyan. - A country’s wealth used to depend on how much gold it had in the treasury, not how many dollars it traded. Libya also has 144 tons of gold. The UK, for example, has twice as much, but ten times the population.\\n\\n- Under Gaddafi’s oil-revenue-sharing program, each Libyan gets $500 (DOLLARS) dumped into his or her bank account, each month.\\n\\nOil which is a cursed commodity destroyed our dear brothers and sisters lives in Libya.

The man's  whole life revolved around lust for the flesh and self gratification instead of spiritual things for building real treasure in heaven...which is the only real wealth you will have after you die. Along the way his works brought many people down into the same pit that he dug himself into.   His lusts and perversions which he never conquered in mortality will haunt him through eternity.  What a sad life. The world may glorify and celebrate him for his wealth, media empire and power here on earth... but in heaven it would have been better for him to have never been born.

qbRKHpE-30Y,"A microwave oven (commonly referred to as a microwave) is a kitchen appliance that heats and cooks food by exposing it to electromagnetic radiation in the microwave frequency range. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer 25–38 mm (1–1.5 inches) of a homogeneous, high water content food item; food is more evenly heated throughout than generally occurs in other cooking techniques.\\n\\nPercy Spencer is generally credited with inventing the modern microwave oven after World War II from radar technology developed during the war. Named the Radarange, it was first sold in 1946. Raytheon later licensed its patents for a home-use microwave oven that was first introduced by Tappan in 1955, but these units were still too large and expensive for general home use. The countertop microwave oven was first introduced in 1967 by the Amana Corporation, and their use has spread into commercial and residential kitchens around the world. In addition to their use in cooking food, types of microwave ovens are used for heating in many industrial processes.\\n\\nMicrowave ovens are popular for reheating previously cooked foods and cooking a variety of foods. They are also useful for rapid heating of otherwise slowly prepared cooking items, such as hot butter, fats, and chocolate. Unlike conventional ovens, microwave ovens usually do not directly brown or caramelize food, since they rarely attain the necessary temperatures to produce Maillard reactions. Exceptions occur in rare cases where the oven is used to heat frying-oil and other very oily items (such as bacon), which attain far higher temperatures than that of boiling water.\\n\\nMicrowave ovens have a limited role in professional cooking,[1] because the boiling-range temperatures produced in especially hydrous foods impede flavors produced by the higher temperatures of frying, browning, or baking. However, additional heat sources can be added to microwave ovens, or into combination microwave ovens, to produce these other heating effects, and microwave heating may cut the overall time needed to prepare such dishes. Some modern microwave ovens are part of over-the-range units with built-in extractor hoods.",0,0

ZaB6kENkGVg,"Drew Taylor from Collider appreciate what you did but I don't agree with your list. Sleeping Beauty at Number 2 over Aladdin, Beauty And The Beast, and Lion King. Wreck It Ralph and Zootopia should be higher. The Fox And The Hound at Number 55! I love that movie. And I don't get why Moana is loved so much and it doesn't deserve Number 9. I'm happy to have a strong female character in a movie but the movie is just okay. The music is fine but I personally preferred the music in Frozen and Tangled more. Also her rooster sidekick is dumb and adds nothing to the movie And the movie lacks a great villain. Hope Collider does a fan poll and Collider video does their own version. Film is subjective and I would like to see their take on the subject.",0,0

Set in a country somewhere we rarely see in a movie, and make its culture part of film's appeal. Invent a brand-new film aesthetic where the background can look as beautiful as the original and not be jarring. The original created a new look for animated movies, and they should commit to do the same, or I cannot support it in any way. Anyways, thanks for bringing it up on the show!",0,0

I'm happy to have a strong female character in a movie but the movie is just okay. The music is fine but I personally preferred the music in Frozen and Tangled more.

I'm happy to have a strong female character in a movie but the movie is just okay. The music is fine but I personally preferred the music in Frozen and Tangled more.

Also the desire by management to put teams physically close together is unproductive. It creates a situation where people are too easily tempted to interrupt others who are trying to focus. Email and IM enable people to control those interruptions. It's hard to ignore someone standing in front of you at your desk. I'm most productive in high-walled cubicles or individual offices. I don't think I would work for a company with open offices. Also, people who like to communicate by mostly phone ...I hate them!

-p6WWRarjNs,"Huzzah for #12 on Trending!! Can I just say I ADORE this guy's speaking voice!? The first video I saw with him was about the oil on bowling lanes and I shared it with people because it was one of those things you don't realize you want to know more about, but is interesting and handy. The first Overrated epi I saw was the Qwerty Keyboard one. I wasn't sure how I felt about it. It seemed at first like it was bashing for bashing's sake. He said that using something without knowing why it's the thing we use is the definition of overrated, which isn't right. So in his POV, solo cups are vastly overrated? It felt like hating for no reason. The first Overrated video was about a specific book I wasn't that interested in, so I didn't watch it. So I expect it to be hit or miss, but if it sticks to broader things that most people deal with, like the way movie theaters work or tipping and why you up some people and cases in which you probably should tip people and you don't realize it, that would be more appealing to more people. The more specific you get, the fewer people watch, but the higher the level of interest. So broad and shallow may be the way to go if views are the goal. The point that the nuance is what's lacking in open offices is a very good point. They can't take half a recipe and expect to have a perfect result, and that's what many companies have done. Also, the open office thing came back after open floor plans in houses came back into vogue. I was a little surprised it wasn't mentioned, because that kind of carry over in thinking happens so often. But just because it increases functionality in one case doesn't mean it's ideal for another, and it's problematic for workers. I'm so happy that I work from home for now. 😅 I'd get so much less done if I had to deal with other people stopping by or the loud chewing or talking of a nearby employee. I also get migraines from a lot of perfumes, so I'd be *that* person who always seems to make a fuss over nothing. All in all, it was a good video. Better than the previous episode.

There will be no more pain or suffering. In fact, God Himself will wipe all tears from our eyes. \\n\\nSo please, if you don't know Jesus, call upon Him today. Repent of your sins and put your faith in Jesus Christ. He loves you, my friends. He is not angry at you, although the devil will have you to believe that He is. This is not true, because Jesus is waiting on you to call upon Him in Truth. \\n\\nHe is not a God who forces Himself on you, He is a God that respects your decision, but He has shown us that each decision we make has consequences. \\n\\nSo make the greatest decision of your life and make Jesus your Lord and Savior. You will be forgiven, you will be delivered, you will be set free. \\n\\nTrust in His Love. \\n\\nI pray you consider calling out to Jesus, because to die without The Lord is a very dangerous thing - there is a major consequence to it. \\n\\nShalom, friends.",0,0

Just looking at how all the guns we're laid out , the types of guns, and how many there were. One man who apparently had no prior convictions or even shot a gun before... could not have carried this out alone, not that way. Then again it is possible, he was an intelligent lunatic and carried it all out by himself but it just seems real odd and fishy. It is also odd one man could carry all those case of guns unnoticed into his room. Another thing which makes it seem awkward. A person who was supposedly not one who used guns.... could kill and injure so many... I understand it was probably a point and shoot sequence but again it would seem weird. I could be very, very wrong on all of this as it is possible. I am no expert, just trying to understand it, either way it is a disturbing moment that happened.

Took away guns from law abiding citizens and did not do the same with the criminals, because guess what, they did not gave away their guns, big surprise, so now we have a disarmed population agains armed criminals, with no way to self defense outside the helping hand of the state. 58 people died in Las Vegas, the worst mass shoting in US history, here 58 people are murder each 8 minutes.

That means the media will try to restrict many things because they'll think average people will have access to game changing equipment. \\n\\n- Paddock did not deliver and unpack everything at the time near or around the shooting, he had that room for about three days which gave him plenty of time to set up. \\n\\n- second shooter reports are false, he switched between two windows and the security guard that fired into the crowd appears to have discharged towards the general direction of where he might have believed the shooter was. One shot From a startled security guard =/= second shooter able to mow down hundreds of people.\\n\\n- he was an ex IRS agent gone postal, his Lockheed Martin history is irrelevant because that occured in the early 1980's.\\n\\n- it is thought there was a second person with him beforehand thanks to a receipt from the hotel posted on online (may be fake)\\n\\nA motive for the killing be it political or not is not available at this time.

-p6WWRarjNs,"I think offices should be designed by the employees with only a few rules. One rule is that it must be a mixture of open office and private rooms. The walls should not be fixed but can be detached and laid out in any layout the employees like - even diagonal walls. Private rooms can hold up to only 3 people. A few rooms must be available for single workers. Now the fun part: No one has a fixed space. You grab whatever you like when you get to work, provided someone hasn't taken it already. After 6 months, the employees must layout the entire office again. Final rule: the boss and other execs don't get private offices. They have the same as everyone else.",0,0

Put aside that the backgrounds look different, there are other reasons why I don´t think this scene will be there or play out different then presented. Rey simply turning to the Dark Side and Kylo training her... makes no sense. Think again, Rey searches her place in this wide world, knowing there is more beyond, feeling there is something reaching out to her, calling her. But her lines that she speaks here apply to Kylo just as much, he too searches his place, believing it is being a Sith but feeling the Light Side. \\nSo, either this are really two completely different scenes, only connected by the lines spoken and what they mean OR Rey understands the ultimate balance and wants to reach out to Kylo, to see the whole picture.\\n\\nI really like the first trailer and the lines spoken there:\\n\\nLuke Skywalker: Breathe.

Please add in more information.\\nAdding in more information would allow your audience to better understand the topic. For example, you failed to mention the factors of intercourse and other factors of birth in this video, leaving your audience slightly uninformed on this topic.\\n2.

But I think a LOT of when (if)it gets a greenlight will depend on the upcoming Tomb Raider film. Why? Because it's a film based off a video gae. And for the most part, game to films don't have a high batting average...\\n\\nanime films to live action? Man, still hope the LA version o Akira makes the finish line. But yeah, Ghost In The Shell had some high points, but in y view had more low ones. And Shell, as pointed out, was a box office disappointment domestically. Death Note was a letdown (go see the LA Japanese version instead folks)...but here's y thinking. Back in 2002, I saw on a big screen at the Austin Film Fest, Cowboy Bebop The Movie. Sold out. It was so popular they had to add another screening. And yes, I loved every damn minute of it. Then I think of Hayao Miyazaki's  Spirited Away and...maybe, just maybe J amine should just be left alone and released domestically or on Netflix/streaming AS IS.\\n\\nRemember---Up had someone die too.

7wsYiuNERZA,"love the video but felt the need to chime in on some... ambitious expectations that some of your viewers have.\\n\\nFirst off how could a story featuring a silent protagonist be more compelling or even comparable to an epic like Lord of the Rings or star wars? Granted the legend of zelda is an great video game, but building a narrative off of a mute protagonist and a cliched villain and damsel in distress hardly seems like a good starting point for a movie. The best thing you could say about turning this game into a movie is that it has a fanbase behind it, which certainly didn't work for the Warcraft movie domestically.\\n\\nAnd the other thing is about the idea that anime centric movies have the potential to be the next big moneymakers. This is ludicrous in all sorts of ways not to mention the real world results we have from something as high profile as Ghost in the Shell. The anime industry itself is in a pretty piss poor state IMO. Rarely do they ever cover anything past the first arc of a story they choose to adapt with a short 13 episode run. These days anime is just used to improve the sales of their Manga and Light Novel counterparts.\\n\\nThere are plenty of old series which you could arguably do a movie about, but trying to cram these epics into a movie format, probably wont go well.\\n\\nSorry for the rant, keep up the good work.",0,0

I'm sorry, I know that's tough to hear when you can't think outside yourself. The last one was bad, the first one was good but didn't appeal to many outside of the comic book and action fanbase. My mom went to see Iron Man, my wife went to see Dr. Strange but they both don't seem interested in Thor. I'd say it's gonna do somewhere around 85-90 mil range.",1,0

7wsYiuNERZA,My problem with critics and marvel movies are they are afraid to give an honest review because the marvel fan base is so large. I feel marvel has some good movies but they've also have some bad ones. A marvel movie being good gets a pass and very little criticism. Most other movie have to be great or amazing to get the same or equal praise. Money runs the world but it's so blatant how many critics pander to marvel. I get it though because they make money off views and alienating a huge section of your audience with negatives about something they love will ultimately hurt these critics bottom lines,5,3
7wsYiuNERZA,It’s not a Marvel film unless you see the word “FUN” plastered on twitter,4,0

7wsYiuNERZA,To me manga > comics.,1,2
7wsYiuNERZA,"I can tell you right now that i didn't click in to watch Death Note because i heard how bad it was. Death note is not a good example. If Hollywood makes a really good anime movie that still bombs, then you can say the audience don't want it. Unfortunately they haven't managed to make a good adaption yet so we don't know.",1,2
7wsYiuNERZA,John the reason the Thor embargo is lifting early is because the film opens in UK/Australia on October 19th.,2,5
7wsYiuNERZA,"Live action Zelda would work much better as HBO series or something, just impossible to do in 2 hours without cheap storytelling. If they make a movie it will make a lot because like you say it's multigenerational, and beloved.",1,3
7wsYiuNERZA,"Hearing the reviews for thor 3 only validates my excitement. I love that Marvel is giving directors more freedom and each new film gets more experimental, and flat out better. I get the feeling phase 4 will give  directors even more freedom and less of an interconnecting story line through all the films.",1,1
7wsYiuNERZA,"The one big problem with a Zelda movie, or most Nintendo movies in general is that they have silent protagonists. That works well in a game when you are controling the person,and he or she is doing what you want. That disappears with the movie. Will this Link do what we would do, will they give him a personality for the sake of a movie? I can't help but feel that it will make or break the movie.",1,1
7wsYiuNERZA,The early reactions are to be expected. Even less-than-remarkable  MCU movies have amazing (early) reviews.,3,2
7wsYiuNERZA,You know what is really weird to me? Ther were 2 trailers and tons of other footage for Thor Raganrok right. Everybody new how the movie looked or would probably look like. But out of no where there are suddenly people who dont like the reviews because they say that the Thor Movie is fun but it shouldnt be because Ragnarok is such a deep and dark Story line? Seriously from where are this guys.,2,1
7wsYiuNERZA,the last of us would be a better movie then a silent guy in a dress in zelda,2,0
7wsYiuNERZA,"why is there gray hair in hulk, i have a problem with that, it throws me out of the movie lol, worst hulk ever, ang lee's hulk would utterly dominate ruffio's hulk...this movie needs more black and white, too much color that a blind man could see",0,0
7wsYiuNERZA,"I blame Hollywood for simply picking the wrong projects to adapt. \\n\\nTake for instance..... \\nGunsmith Cats: Two young women that get involved in high action nonsense, in _Chicago_ no less.\\n\\nBiohunter: Two scientists in dealing with something known as the devil virus which one infected by it is able to focus it into a strength. \\n\\nBlack Magic M-66: Two army robots that happened to be programmed to hunt down the one researchers daughter and some reporter is trying to save her. \\n\\nKind of cliche, but far under the budget of a GITS or Death Note and totally doable. But no, let's do a 140M budgeted Akira, a movie deep seeded in Japan because that's smart.",1,0

7wsYiuNERZA,"the problem with anime (Ghost in the Shell) is that hollywood did a terrable job that not even the fans of Anime wanted to watch it. If they just made it smart like the original anime, at least they would have had the fans raving about it and maybe could have brought in more fans. they way they made it the fans did not want to watch it and other people had no idea what it was really about.",0,1

7wsYiuNERZA,"I have been wanting to be a part of a zelda movie somehow so badly even though that will most likely not happen. id pitch it as lord of the rings meets indiana jones, create one single movie and story with no references to sequels, and have it end so if it doesnt get a greenlight for a sequel, it still stands on its own, and if its good then make a trilogy. ive been thinking about ideas for the first movie for years and own/have played every zelda game, but i bet im not the only one. hopefully if it does get made it ends up being great because i see a lot of potential for it",0,1
7wsYiuNERZA,I read all the Thor reactions earlier and the one theme in them all..comedy. And.I wasn't very happy about that. Hulk and Thor in a buddy comedy. GOTG I expect that. But this movie I was hoping took the theme seriously. But with lukewarm reception to the last movies they decided to jump the shark.,0,2

7wsYiuNERZA,If this makes people more excited for thor thats great I was all ready excited for it.I dont trust critics they also said the new Spiderman was amazing but it wasnt so I could care less what critics think.I have a feeling im gonna enjoy the movie but not because of critics.I think it will be the best Thor movie of the 3 films.,0,1
7wsYiuNERZA,I commented that I'm not interested in seeing Thor Ragnarok but I had to delete it because I got so many toxic responses from marvel fanboys. I don't like your movies but why do you feel the need to attack me?,1,6
7wsYiuNERZA,"I have a genuine question, Is the MCU a comedy shared universe or a comic book shared universe. I get disappointed by the lack of respect they show to the characters. To me it feels like a parody of what the real thing should be.",1,3
7wsYiuNERZA,All the responses say Thor is a fun fun comedy hilarious fun comedy - nothing about depth or serious film - everything it shouldn't be - Ragnarok is the end of Asgard - is it dumb and dumber or an action film,2,5
7wsYiuNERZA,Great...they took the darkest Marvel storyline and made it a slapstick comedy. Im fucking done with Marvel. This is bullshit. You wanted GOTG 3 well here you go.,1,5

It YEARNS to be in balance, not within the universe, but within the USER; a balance of good and evil, light and dark within the one who carries it, and she too will reject the Jedi. Not to become a Sith, but that both Kylo and Rey will transcend the ideologies of the past and become something more, something truly balanced, and something truly fearsome.",0,0

I think brands should at least study the brand to help expand themselves since a lot of people want expansions too in other brands to be more inclusive.",0,0

And for the most part, game to films don't have a high batting average...\\n\\nanime films to live action? Man, still hope the LA version o Akira makes the finish line. But yeah, Ghost In The Shell had some high points, but in y view had more low ones. And Shell, as pointed out, was a box office disappointment domestically. Death Note was a letdown (go see the LA Japanese version instead folks)...but here's y thinking. Back in 2002, I saw on a big screen at the Austin Film Fest, Cowboy Bebop The Movie. Sold out. It was so popular they had to add another screening. And yes, I loved every damn minute of it. Then I think of Hayao Miyazaki's  Spirited Away and...maybe, just maybe J amine should just be left alone and released domestically or on Netflix/streaming AS IS.\\n\\nRemember---Up had someone die too. Within the first five minutes or so. A sad moment, but were any of the young were scarred for life? I don't know about anyone else, but I got over Bambi's mom biting the dust a long time ago.",0,0

7wsYiuNERZA,"love the video but felt the need to chime in on some... ambitious expectations that some of your viewers have.\\n\\nFirst off how could a story featuring a silent protagonist be more compelling or even comparable to an epic like Lord of the Rings or star wars? Granted the legend of zelda is an great video game, but building a narrative off of a mute protagonist and a cliched villain and damsel in distress hardly seems like a good starting point for a movie. The best thing you could say about turning this game into a movie is that it has a fanbase behind it, which certainly didn't work for the Warcraft movie domestically.\\n\\nAnd the other thing is about the idea that anime centric movies have the potential to be the next big moneymakers. This is ludicrous in all sorts of ways not to mention the real world results we have from something as high profile as Ghost in the Shell. The anime industry itself is in a pretty piss poor state IMO. Rarely do they ever cover anything past the first arc of a story they choose to adapt with a short 13 episode run. These days anime is just used to improve the sales of their Manga and Light Novel counterparts.\\n\\nThere are plenty of old series which you could arguably do a movie about, but trying to cram these epics into a movie format, probably wont go well.\\n\\nSorry for the rant, keep up the good work.",0,0

7wsYiuNERZA,My problem with critics and marvel movies are they are afraid to give an honest review because the marvel fan base is so large. I feel marvel has some good movies but they've also have some bad ones. A marvel movie being good gets a pass and very little criticism. Most other movie have to be great or amazing to get the same or equal praise. Money runs the world but it's so blatant how many critics pander to marvel. I get it though because they make money off views and alienating a huge section of your audience with negatives about something they love will ultimately hurt these critics bottom lines,5,3

7wsYiuNERZA,It’s not a Marvel film unless you see the word “FUN” plastered on twitter,4,0
7wsYiuNERZA,John the reason the Thor embargo is lifting early is because the film opens in UK/Australia on October 19th.,2,5
7wsYiuNERZA,"Live action Zelda would work much better as HBO series or something, just impossible to do in 2 hours without cheap storytelling. If they make a movie it will make a lot because like you say it's multigenerational, and beloved.",1,3
7wsYiuNERZA,"I can tell you right now that i didn't click in to watch Death Note because i heard how bad it was. Death note is not a good example. If Hollywood makes a really good anime movie that still bombs, then you can say the audience don't want it. Unfortunately they haven't managed to make a good adaption yet so we don't know.",1,2
7wsYiuNERZA,To me manga > comics.,2,2
7wsYiuNERZA,You know what is really weird to me? Ther were 2 trailers and tons of other footage for Thor Raganrok right. Everybody new how the movie looked or would probably look like. But out of no where there are suddenly people who dont like the reviews because they say that the Thor Movie is fun but it shouldnt be because Ragnarok is such a deep and dark Story line? Seriously from where are this guys.,2,1
7wsYiuNERZA,How about a solo hulk movies if this is good movie,2,1
7wsYiuNERZA,"I really like Thor and I'm definitely gonna see it opening weekend, but it wont even crack 100 Mil. People don't care about Thor as much as the other marvel movies. I'm sorry, I know that's tough to hear when you can't think outside yourself. The last one was bad, the first one was good but didn't appeal to many outside of the comic book and action fanbase. My mom went to see Iron Man, my wife went to see Dr. Strange but they both don't seem interested in Thor. I'd say it's gonna do somewhere around 85-90 mil range.",1,2

7wsYiuNERZA,"Hearing the reviews for thor 3 only validates my excitement. I love that Marvel is giving directors more freedom and each new film gets more experimental, and flat out better. I get the feeling phase 4 will give  directors even more freedom and less of an interconnecting story line through all the films.",1,1
7wsYiuNERZA,"The one big problem with a Zelda movie, or most Nintendo movies in general is that they have silent protagonists. That works well in a game when you are controling the person,and he or she is doing what you want. That disappears with the movie. Will this Link do what we would do, will they give him a personality for the sake of a movie? I can't help but feel that it will make or break the movie.",1,1

7wsYiuNERZA,"I blame Hollywood for simply picking the wrong projects to adapt. \\n\\nTake for instance..... \\nGunsmith Cats: Two young women that get involved in high action nonsense, in _Chicago_ no less.\\n\\nBiohunter: Two scientists in dealing with something known as the devil virus which one infected by it is able to focus it into a strength. \\n\\nBlack Magic M-66: Two army robots that happened to be programmed to hunt down the one researchers daughter and some reporter is trying to save her. \\n\\nKind of cliche, but far under the budget of a GITS or Death Note and totally doable.

7wsYiuNERZA,I read all the Thor reactions earlier and the one theme in them all..comedy. And.I wasn't very happy about that. Hulk and Thor in a buddy comedy. GOTG I expect that. But this movie I was hoping took the theme seriously. But with lukewarm reception to the last movies they decided to jump the shark.,0,2
7wsYiuNERZA,"the problem with anime (Ghost in the Shell) is that hollywood did a terrable job that not even the fans of Anime wanted to watch it.

PgeJ0XYuI2E,Great review Marques.  Very informative and insightful. We can all take test scores at face value but as in this case when we investigate further the scores are revealed as not as all encompassing as they should be.,0,0
PgeJ0XYuI2E,"I don't agree with this. Zoom isn't as much of a factor when it's digital zoom. Digital zoom will actually hurt image quality so having a greater zoom doesn't mean shit unless they've actually non-fixed focal length lens. Contrast, color, sharpness, and focus should be the main targets for a great cell phone camera. The dedicated lens is overrated imo. I've seen comparisons for the Note 8, Iphone 8, and Pixel 2 and thought the Note and Pixel won the majority of them. Pixel handled certain lighting conditions and colors better and the Note looked better in others. I do notice Note has darker lows while the Pixel seemed more neutral (the way professionals often shoot and they can adjust in post.) All top tier phones currently have pretty incredible cameras so it's all pretty trivial at this point but I definitely think the best camera is between Note 8 and Pixel 2.",0,0
PgeJ0XYuI2E,"I'm glad to have watched this, very informative.",0,0
PgeJ0XYuI2E,DxO Mark is where professional togs go to assess their next DSLR. It's extremely accurate for people who spend thousands on cameras and lenses. For the simple fact the camera phones are being assessed at all is a massive step forward. I was honestly blown away with the images taken in good light with the Pixel 2. Good breakdown.,0,0
PgeJ0XYuI2E,Not often do you come across a weighted scoring system that doesn’t add to 100. Since the points in the breakdown are all under 100 it is misleading that it is not a percentage. Cameras are always evolving and improving hence why you can’t really have a perfect 100 point camera. Dxomark should release some sort of video explaining their scoring system.,0,0

I really hope for the sake of the NBA, its fans, the philly ones in particular, that this kid stays healthy and has a long career. His ceiling is the best player in the NBA and I dont think thats a stretch. Embiids athleticism for a guy over 7' is on another level than everyone playing right now, including AD. The sixers rebuild is all about him. If hes able to play 60 plus games every year plus playoffs, they will be a true contender yr in and yr out. He is a generational talent. Moves like a SF/PF, and is the biggest player on the court, his shot and basketball skills, and first step are all very good and impressive aswell. Skys the limit!",0,0

y8fZDZHSl7Q,"I agree that yes it is competitive in makeup brands but there should be room for every brand out there. MakeUp Forever was not the only one who threw shade towards Fenti Beauty, also MakeUp Geek, Huda (sorry for misspelling that) was said to throw shade but that video was deleted, and even Kiley and Kim stopped following Rhiana. I think brands should at least study the brand to help expand themselves since a lot of people want expansions too in other brands to be more inclusive.",0,0

7wsYiuNERZA,"Zelda film? Yes, I can see it happening one day. Good luck to the folks  who have to pitch it. But I think a LOT of when (if)it gets a greenlight will depend on the upcoming Tomb Raider film. Why? Because it's a film based off a video gae. And for the most part, game to films don't have a high batting average...\\n\\nanime films to live action? Man, still hope the LA version o Akira makes the finish line. But yeah, Ghost In The Shell had some high points, but in y view had more low ones. And Shell, as pointed out, was a box office disappointment domestically. Death Note was a letdown (go see the LA Japanese version instead folks)...but here's y thinking. Back in 2002, I saw on a big screen at the Austin Film Fest, Cowboy Bebop The Movie. Sold out. It was so popular they had to add another screening. And yes, I loved every damn minute of it. Then I think of Hayao Miyazaki's  Spirited Away and...maybe, just maybe J amine should just be left alone and released domestically or on Netflix/streaming AS IS.\\n\\nRemember---Up had someone die too.

7wsYiuNERZA,Was playing Breath of the Wild when this video popped up; stopped to watch it.,0,0
7wsYiuNERZA,"love the video but felt the need to chime in on some... ambitious expectations that some of your viewers have.\\n\\nFirst off how could a story featuring a silent protagonist be more compelling or even comparable to an epic like Lord of the Rings or star wars? Granted the legend of zelda is an great video game, but building a narrative off of a mute protagonist and a cliched villain and damsel in distress hardly seems like a good starting point for a movie. The best thing you could say about turning this game into a movie is that it has a fanbase behind it, which certainly didn't work for the Warcraft movie domestically.\\n\\nAnd the other thing is about the idea that anime centric movies have the potential to be the next big moneymakers. This is ludicrous in all sorts of ways not to mention the real world results we have from something as high profile as Ghost in the Shell. The anime industry itself is in a pretty piss poor state IMO. Rarely do they ever cover anything past the first arc of a story they choose to adapt with a short 13 episode run. These days anime is just used to improve the sales of their Manga and Light Novel counterparts.\\n\\nThere are plenty of old series which you could arguably do a movie about, but trying to cram these epics into a movie format, probably wont go well.\\n\\nSorry for the rant, keep up the good work.",0,0

7wsYiuNERZA,My problem with critics and marvel movies are they are afraid to give an honest review because the marvel fan base is so large. I feel marvel has some good movies but they've also have some bad ones. A marvel movie being good gets a pass and very little criticism. Most other movie have to be great or amazing to get the same or equal praise. Money runs the world but it's so blatant how many critics pander to marvel. I get it though because they make money off views and alienating a huge section of your audience with negatives about something they love will ultimately hurt these critics bottom lines,5,3

7wsYiuNERZA,The early reactions are to be expected. Even less-than-remarkable  MCU movies have amazing (early) reviews.,3,2
7wsYiuNERZA,"Hearing the reviews for thor 3 only validates my excitement. I love that Marvel is giving directors more freedom and each new film gets more experimental, and flat out better. I get the feeling phase 4 will give  directors even more freedom and less of an interconnecting story line through all the films.",1,1
7wsYiuNERZA,You know what is really weird to me? Ther were 2 trailers and tons of other footage for Thor Raganrok right. Everybody new how the movie looked or would probably look like. But out of no where there are suddenly people who dont like the reviews because they say that the Thor Movie is fun but it shouldnt be because Ragnarok is such a deep and dark Story line? Seriously from where are this guys.,2,1
7wsYiuNERZA,"The one big problem with a Zelda movie, or most Nintendo movies in general is that they have silent protagonists. That works well in a game when you are controling the person,and he or she is doing what you want. That disappears with the movie. Will this Link do what we would do, will they give him a personality for the sake of a movie? I can't help but feel that it will make or break the movie.",1,1

7wsYiuNERZA,"the problem with anime (Ghost in the Shell) is that hollywood did a terrable job that not even the fans of Anime wanted to watch it. If they just made it smart like the original anime, at least they would have had the fans raving about it and maybe could have brought in more fans. they way they made it the fans did not want to watch it and other people had no idea what it was really about.",0,1

7wsYiuNERZA,All the responses say Thor is a fun fun comedy hilarious fun comedy - nothing about depth or serious film - everything it shouldn't be - Ragnarok is the end of Asgard - is it dumb and dumber or an action film,2,5
7wsYiuNERZA,Great...they took the darkest Marvel storyline and made it a slapstick comedy. Im fucking done with Marvel. This is bullshit. You wanted GOTG 3 well here you go.,1,5
7wsYiuNERZA,"I really like Thor and I'm definitely gonna see it opening weekend, but it wont even crack 100 Mil. People don't care about Thor as much as the other marvel movies. I'm sorry, I know that's tough to hear when you can't think outside yourself. The last one was bad, the first one was good but didn't appeal to many outside of the comic book and action fanbase. My mom went to see Iron Man, my wife went to see Dr. Strange but they both don't seem interested in Thor. I'd say it's gonna do somewhere around 85-90 mil range.",1,2
7wsYiuNERZA,To me manga > comics.,2,2
7wsYiuNERZA,I read all the Thor reactions earlier and the one theme in them all..comedy. And.I wasn't very happy about that. Hulk and Thor in a buddy comedy. GOTG I expect that. But this movie I was hoping took the theme seriously. But with lukewarm reception to the last movies they decided to jump the shark.,0,2
7wsYiuNERZA,"i didn't hate Death Note but it wasn't great, Lakeith was the highlight for me personally",0,2
7wsYiuNERZA,"Yeah Campea, weren't early Vol.2 reactions that it was the best Marvel movie ever? It wasn't.\\n\\nI don't think Reggie would want to gamble with a Zelda movie given how attached to the franchise he is. Video games need to stay video games and movies need to stay movies (with a few exceptions from the 90s).",0,1

PgeJ0XYuI2E,Apple and Sammy rushed in with a lot of money... LOL 😂😂🙏🏼,0,0
PgeJ0XYuI2E,"Completely agree. It's similar to how the latest chips with the highest clock speeds and number of cores doesn't mean that they'll run the fastest in practice. And how the batteries with the highest mWh doesn't guarantee the longest battery life, even with all other specs being almost identical like screen resolution, OS version etc.\\n\\nThat's why I admire how Apple does things. They focus more on what's important for the consumer and not what's important on the spec sheet. Like creating an excellent 1080p display vs creating a not excellent but still good higher resolution display, because most content on mobile is still on 1080p anyway, and a higher resolution would benefit a larger display much more like a computer or TV monitor. For people who stream videos using data too, most of the time it's 1080p, or else the data will be drained soo quickly.",0,0
PgeJ0XYuI2E,"Well, thank god, I don't pay attention to  this DXO score and never really cared. I stopped caring when a few years ago, a phone claimed to make a better picture than an iPhone 6S by some score.

PgeJ0XYuI2E,"It's probably the best review website for smartphone cameras available on the Internet right now, but people are misusing a whoooole lot.\\nThanks for the explainer Marques, you are right on the money.\\n\\nYou basically cannot have a single score that is completely representative of camera quality because not only there's a whole ton of variables and a whole ton of photography needs, you also end up with some pretty subjective stuff mixed in between.\\n\\nFor instance, some people might find a color profile that is completely uncalibrated over a perfect calibration. Ever wonder why people use filters so much? There's a miriad of factors that work just like that. Even a broke down score sheet with several different judging factors is leaving out a whole lot of stuff that matters.\\n\\nAnd even outside all that, people should know that you can get some pretty awesome smartphone cameras in smartphone that will give you a pretty bad experience in everything else. This isn't happening so much these days since features have plateaued quite a bit, but I do remember hybrid smartphones of the past that tried to make plenty good cameras, but ended up with a smartphone that was really annoying to use and carry around.\\n\\nFinally, let me add just one bit about YouTube reviews in general... people should know that what you see on YouTube regarding videos and photos from cameras might not be good enough for reviews. Simply put, YouTube compression has a major influence over it. Not saying it shouldn't be done, not saying they aren't helpful, but much like review websites caveats, it's something to know about so you don't completely rely on one source or another exclusively and end up with a bad device as result.",0,0

I really hope for the sake of the NBA, its fans, the philly ones in particular, that this kid stays healthy and has a long career. His ceiling is the best player in the NBA and I dont think thats a stretch. Embiids athleticism for a guy over 7' is on another level than everyone playing right now, including AD. The sixers rebuild is all about him. If hes able to play 60 plus games every year plus playoffs, they will be a true contender yr in and yr out. He is a generational talent. Moves like a SF/PF, and is the biggest player on the court, his shot and basketball skills, and first step are all very good and impressive aswell. Skys the limit!",0,0

y8fZDZHSl7Q,"I agree that yes it is competitive in makeup brands but there should be room for every brand out there. MakeUp Forever was not the only one who threw shade towards Fenti Beauty, also MakeUp Geek, Huda (sorry for misspelling that) was said to throw shade but that video was deleted, and even Kiley and Kim stopped following Rhiana. I think brands should at least study the brand to help expand themselves since a lot of people want expansions too in other brands to be more inclusive.",0,0

PgeJ0XYuI2E,"What I don't understand is, why give a DXO score like 98 for the Pixel 2 when it isn't an average of the complete test table scores? If your not using an average then you might as well literally add all the numbers from the complete test table and the total becomes the new overall score. So the pixel 2 score would then become a 604 for example? Then the press can say THE PIXEL 2 GOT A 604 DXO RATING! THE HIGHEST EVER!

y8fZDZHSl7Q,"I agree that yes it is competitive in makeup brands but there should be room for every brand out there. MakeUp Forever was not the only one who threw shade towards Fenti Beauty, also MakeUp Geek, Huda (sorry for misspelling that) was said to throw shade but that video was deleted, and even Kiley and Kim stopped following Rhiana. I think brands should at least study the brand to help expand themselves since a lot of people want expansions too in other brands to be more inclusive.",0,0

0ceNfXrccbQ,So let me get this straight. A Hollywood director uses his money and fame to bully women into sleeping with him. And people are shocked that this happened? I mean come on people.

Disgusting. Can we now all grow up and admit that the Jewish Democrats are the biggest promoters of hatred towards Trump and his primarily Gentile middle-class voters?

PgeJ0XYuI2E,"I'm a sociologist and i found your video kinda awesome in an epistemology and methodology way. I make a lot of researchs in different areas and also work as a consultant for financial entities. Sometimes we have to weight the results in order to achieve a) the measures the universe is suppose to have or b) to put priority on what is important for the client. As a sociologist i know that measures are always artificial and imperfect  but if it is done rigoruosly, and that's the key word, it can help to achieve the objective (not perfect or universal but helpful). We have to understand that we, as humans, can't measure things in a pure objective way, there are always a lot of variables that aren't included in the researchs and the tools we use to measure are relative to our perception. So always grab investigations, researchs or reviews with a grain of salt, or better try to understand how the research was done.",0,0

Which is what I *really* wanted. Everything looks clean despite form always following function. Nothing is more detailed aesthetically than it needs to be to communicate what it is and its current state.\\n\\nBut what I see *upgraded* is the nice perk of translucent title bars (which actually serve a purpose -- hints at what is behind without obscuring whatever is on the title bar itself), the slight stroke trims around selections which adds to visual/use clarity, and the splash effect that adds to the communication of 'exactly which button you clicked on' (which you'd think isn't necessary, but most interfaces you use have some indicator of this so you haven't experienced the lack of indication).\\n\\nThat's what I like about what Fluent Design is *now* compared to before -- Its design intended to make the *use of the computer* easier, not make it snazzier or flashier.",0,0

pT-zok786Yc,"OK here's some ideas. Sorry it's not written in order. Make me your CEO.\\n- Get out of the phone OS business and make Microsoft/Nokia Android phone with custom default apps and a unique launcher, and throw in the Office apps and Skype and FB messenger, and an Edge browser with the actual fu cking engine.\\n- Why not also make an Xbox (Android) Phone with hyper responsive cloud gaming (processing on server) too?\\n- Stay in the tablet business\\n- Forget failed Windows 10. Go back to Windows 7, beef up security, bring Edge engine and include the sandboxed app model for Win32 apps.\\n- Keep the touch screen keyboard and add a start screen but only for tablets\\n- Add a new login screen with dynamic wallpapers and add a ribbon explorer with the Vista/7 Aero UI.\\n- Separate the concept of desktop and phone/tablet UIs, you've been fu cking it up since the 2000s.\\n- First you tried a desktop UI on a PDA which was slow and needed a stylus, then you tried a phone touch UI on a desktop which is clunky and awkward and a waste of space. One doesn't work half as well on the other. Sorry but yes, you have to maintain 2 versions of apps but who gives a sh it?\\n- Make search faster. Make desktop and phone apps as easy to write as WinForm apps were, but with more consistency so third-party apps can be written quickly and look as good as  Microsoft apps. How about use the Java language and a Microsoft Java runtime and make it a core part of the Windows experience (I know you don't want to)?\\n- Make a framework for app development that makes apps easy to write, look amazing and function extremely well.\\n- Framework should work on Windows desktop and tablet, and Android devices. You can extend it for Microsoft/Nokia branded phones by allowing it to support specific hardware features.\\n- Keep the software fu cking light, computers will be choking even with 8GB of RAM soon because code quality and programming practices are sh it\\n- Sort out the Hi-DPI mess\\n- Rebrand Bing as Bing com. Make Bing technologies free (in some cases)/ad-tied/ultra-low-cost and get developers using them in apps and infrastructure but also BRANDING Search powered by Bing com everywhere. Get third-party developers providing you their data so you can improve the engine and sell more ads.\\n- Keep doing all the cloud stuff you're already doing\\n- Make an Xbox that plays 360/OG Xbox games if you have the disc\\n- Stop overdoing this horrid tile UI crap, it worked as a home screen for a phone and nowhere else\\n- Don't scratch your heads wondering what happened when you fail if you didn't do this sh it.",0,1

TXo-qOQNK3E,"I'm so excited to see you and Hank in St Louis this week, but John! Your mental health is always a top priority! Do what you can to take care of yourself, okay? As a more introverted person with anxiety issues myself, I can't even imagine doing all the amazing and demanding work you do. So, even though I'm sure lots of people who love and support you have already said this, I'm going to give you a couple of reminders: You're doing great. Be kind to yourself. Sometimes you have to say no to things you really want to do or people you don't want to disappoint in order to maintain your sanity, and that's perfectly okay! (I know you know that, but I need to hear it all the time so I figured it wouldn't hurt to reiterate.) \\nYou've already done so much to decrease worldsuck and bring about positive changes, in ways large and small. \\nSo while you're on tour, take breaks when you can, call Sarah and your adorable kiddos, run a nice warm bath (hopefully your hotels have super nice bathrooms), read, take some deep breaths, and just remember that things will get better. \\n\\nAs a side note: you've done a lot for Nerdfighteria lately with writing a beautiful new book and going on tour to see us-- I wonder what the Nerdfighters could do to give back a little bit of the joy we've gotten from those wonderful things. Ideas, anyone? Perhaps we can support John and Hank in taking some vacation time after the tour ends, at the very least? I imagine it's difficult to give your family as much attention as you'd like when you're so often in the public eye with constant demands for your time and energy. \\n\\nAnyway, we're all here for you guys. Thanks for everything ❤️",0,0

Which is what I *really* wanted. Everything looks clean despite form always following function. Nothing is more detailed aesthetically than it needs to be to communicate what it is and its current state.\\n\\nBut what I see *upgraded* is the nice perk of translucent title bars (which actually serve a purpose -- hints at what is behind without obscuring whatever is on the title bar itself), the slight stroke trims around selections which adds to visual/use clarity, and the splash effect that adds to the communication of 'exactly which button you clicked on' (which you'd think isn't necessary, but most interfaces you use have some indicator of this so you haven't experienced the lack of indication).\\n\\nThat's what I like about what Fluent Design is *now* compared to before -- Its design intended to make the *use of the computer* easier, not make it snazzier or flashier.",0,0

Make me your CEO.\\n- Get out of the phone OS business and make Microsoft/Nokia Android phone with custom default apps and a unique launcher, and throw in the Office apps and Skype and FB messenger, and an Edge browser with the actual fu cking engine.\\n- Why not also make an Xbox (Android) Phone with hyper responsive cloud gaming (processing on server) too?\\n- Stay in the tablet business\\n- Forget failed Windows 10. Go back to Windows 7, beef up security, bring Edge engine and include the sandboxed app model for Win32 apps.\\n- Keep the touch screen keyboard and add a start screen but only for tablets\\n- Add a new login screen with dynamic wallpapers and add a ribbon explorer with the Vista/7 Aero UI.\\n- Separate the concept of desktop and phone/tablet UIs, you've been fu cking it up since the 2000s.\\n- First you tried a desktop UI on a PDA which was slow and needed a stylus, then you tried a phone touch UI on a desktop which is clunky and awkward and a waste of space. One doesn't work half as well on the other. Sorry but yes, you have to maintain 2 versions of apps but who gives a sh it?\\n- Make search faster. Make desktop and phone apps as easy to write as WinForm apps were, but with more consistency so third-party apps can be written quickly and look as good as  Microsoft apps. How about use the Java language and a Microsoft Java runtime and make it a core part of the Windows experience (I know you don't want to)?\\n- Make a framework for app development that makes apps easy to write, look amazing and function extremely well.\\n- Framework should work on Windows desktop and tablet, and Android devices. You can extend it for Microsoft/Nokia branded phones by allowing it to support specific hardware features.\\n- Keep the software fu cking light, computers will be choking even with 8GB of RAM soon because code quality and programming practices are sh it\\n- Sort out the Hi-DPI mess\\n- Rebrand Bing as Bing com. Make Bing technologies free (in some cases)/ad-tied/ultra-low-cost and get developers using them in apps and infrastructure but also BRANDING Search powered by Bing com everywhere. Get third-party developers providing you their data so you can improve the engine and sell more ads.\\n- Keep doing all the cloud stuff you're already doing\\n- Make an Xbox that plays 360/OG Xbox games if you have the disc\\n- Stop overdoing this horrid tile UI crap, it worked as a home screen for a phone and nowhere else\\n- Don't scratch your heads wondering what happened when you fail if you didn't do this sh it.",0,1

One thing I would like to see is the help link within an app actually point to the issue at hand instead of going to a general help page.  When I need help files it's because I don't know how to do something which makes it hard to know where to look for answers. I love Windows 10 now that I'm used to it.  I am a bit upset that none of my expensive graphics, video, and website design software isn't compatible but I'll get over it once I'm out of debt from having to purchase all new programs.  They are better suited for the times but I hadn't planned on such a huge investment when I bought my new computer.

Which is what I *really* wanted. Everything looks clean despite form always following function. Nothing is more detailed aesthetically than it needs to be to communicate what it is and its current state.\\n\\nBut what I see *upgraded* is the nice perk of translucent title bars (which actually serve a purpose -- hints at what is behind without obscuring whatever is on the title bar itself), the slight stroke trims around selections which adds to visual/use clarity, and the splash effect that adds to the communication of 'exactly which button you clicked on' (which you'd think isn't necessary, but most interfaces you use have some indicator of this so you haven't experienced the lack of indication).\\n\\nThat's what I like about what Fluent Design is *now* compared to before -- Its design intended to make the *use of the computer* easier, not make it snazzier or flashier.",0,0

pT-zok786Yc,"OK here's some ideas. Sorry it's not written in order. Make me your CEO.\\n- Get out of the phone OS business and make Microsoft/Nokia Android phone with custom default apps and a unique launcher, and throw in the Office apps and Skype and FB messenger, and an Edge browser with the actual fu cking engine.\\n- Why not also make an Xbox (Android) Phone with hyper responsive cloud gaming (processing on server) too?\\n- Stay in the tablet business\\n- Forget failed Windows 10. Go back to Windows 7, beef up security, bring Edge engine and include the sandboxed app model for Win32 apps.\\n- Keep the touch screen keyboard and add a start screen but only for tablets\\n- Add a new login screen with dynamic wallpapers and add a ribbon explorer with the Vista/7 Aero UI.\\n- Separate the concept of desktop and phone/tablet UIs, you've been fu cking it up since the 2000s.\\n- First you tried a desktop UI on a PDA which was slow and needed a stylus, then you tried a phone touch UI on a desktop which is clunky and awkward and a waste of space. One doesn't work half as well on the other. Sorry but yes, you have to maintain 2 versions of apps but who gives a sh it?\\n- Make search faster. Make desktop and phone apps as easy to write as WinForm apps were, but with more consistency so third-party apps can be written quickly and look as good as  Microsoft apps. How about use the Java language and a Microsoft Java runtime and make it a core part of the Windows experience (I know you don't want to)?\\n- Make a framework for app development that makes apps easy to write, look amazing and function extremely well.\\n- Framework should work on Windows desktop and tablet, and Android devices. You can extend it for Microsoft/Nokia branded phones by allowing it to support specific hardware features.\\n- Keep the software fu cking light, computers will be choking even with 8GB of RAM soon because code quality and programming practices are sh it\\n- Sort out the Hi-DPI mess\\n- Rebrand Bing as Bing com. Make Bing technologies free (in some cases)/ad-tied/ultra-low-cost and get developers using them in apps and infrastructure but also BRANDING Search powered by Bing com everywhere. Get third-party developers providing you their data so you can improve the engine and sell more ads.\\n- Keep doing all the cloud stuff you're already doing\\n- Make an Xbox that plays 360/OG Xbox games if you have the disc\\n- Stop overdoing this horrid tile UI crap, it worked as a home screen for a phone and nowhere else\\n- Don't scratch your heads wondering what happened when you fail if you didn't do this sh it.",0,1

TXo-qOQNK3E,"John ... Turtles All The Way Down is an absolute masterpiece, and by far my favorite of your books (so far!). I do not have the perspective of someone with mental illness, but I saw myself in Daisy. There's someone very close to me in my life who has depression. Your book reflected a mirror back at myself, I saw myself for the first time through my loved one's eyes as I saw Daisy through Aza's eyes. I did not particularly like what I saw, and it was not easy, but ... it is an invaluable gift of perspective that you've given me, something I haven't been able to find anywhere else. I will reread this book for a very long time and, I have a feeling, get something new out of it each time. Congratulations and thank you <3",0,0

L87l9-2B0ug,"☝How to waste your life away by watching dumb videos.\\n\\nThis world; Its ALL biblical. We are the last generation. Evil is rampant because Satan knows his time is coming to a close he is trying hard to drag all to hell with him. He's doing a fine job. People are all in a deep sleep and care only about being entertained trying to be famous and shopping in strip mall's and listening to terrible satanically inspired music etc. Its a Godless world and all will be totally surprised when Jesus comes and they get left to deal with Satan in reality with all his demons which instead of being invisible will be completely visible to the naked eye. Only then will people believe this world is all one giant spiritual battle. Jesus died for us, loves us, and wants us to escape hell which is an actual place. \\n\\nToss aside this temporary world. If you do not know Jesus Christ or believe in God, I urge you to start. Whether you believe or not does not change the fact that The One and Only Jesus Christ is on his way....shortly. Like days. How many? Not sure. But my spirit feels it. This world is messed up. You must admit that. Its all a lie...all the things you think make you happy are lies. The devil hates you and is laughing at you. Jesus loves you. He died for you and the entire world. Even if you don't  love him. He is waiting for you to receive him in your heart. If you are ready to receive Jesus into your heart pray this prayer before it's too late. This is an urgent warning. Pray: Jesus I am a sinner, I believe you died on the cross for me and my sins and rose from the dead. Please forgive me of all my sins I am repenting now and I ask you to enter my heart right now. Change me. I want to make you happy. I want to be happy and go to heaven. I do not want to be stuck in the tribulation. Help me to open my spiritual eyes and ears before you get here. I ask this in Jesus name Amen! \\n\\nIf you just prayed this prayer welcome to the family! You made the most important decision of your life right now. Don't stop praying and remember a prayer can be a simple as Jesus, help me!  now get a bible or an app and read about revelation. And read Matthew and John chapters. For a start. I pray you made the right decision and prayed that prayer. See you in heaven!💛💛😘👏👍😊 \\n\\nTwitter: @YoNaturefreek",0,0

TXo-qOQNK3E,"John ... Turtles All The Way Down is an absolute masterpiece, and by far my favorite of your books (so far!). I do not have the perspective of someone with mental illness, but I saw myself in Daisy. There's someone very close to me in my life who has depression. Your book reflected a mirror back at myself, I saw myself for the first time through my loved one's eyes as I saw Daisy through Aza's eyes. I did not particularly like what I saw, and it was not easy, but ... it is an invaluable gift of perspective that you've given me, something I haven't been able to find anywhere else. I will reread this book for a very long time and, I have a feeling, get something new out of it each time. Congratulations and thank you <3",0,0

And then I’ll never see the light of day because I’m stuck in hotel ball rooms until bed time, and my room is just a windowless elevator ride away. Super short commute though.

Super nice area though love visiting the downtown and going to the farmers market :) Also, I4 is the worst nobody likes it everyone hates it. I am learning to drive and will sometime in the future have to drive on it... and that is a terror inducing thought.
