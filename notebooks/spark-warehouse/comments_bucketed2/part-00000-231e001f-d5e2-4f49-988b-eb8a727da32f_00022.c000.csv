xHvVhhFvLtY,the phrase sea urchin heaven reminds me of a trip to Costa Rica. We went to a black sand beach that I assume was once part of a lava flow. The entire sea floor off the beach was solid black lava rock. Thank goodness I was snorkeling on the surface and not stepping on the rocks because every ~2 inches there was a sea urchin. The entire sea floor was covered in bore pockets with a black/deep purple urchin in every one. It was so awesome to see and I wanted to share this because I think that beach was the best place to call a sea urchin heaven,0,0

If the tribes of Isreal ,as well as the 'gentiles''(all other nationalities), will be ripped out of the land ! Do you see the floods in all continents in different provinces ! Our Father God of Isreal curses as a punishment to the sinners who refuse to accept Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior !Out of Pure love , this message a warning to many of you, who walk in sin ! Turn your hearts and lives !, Confess with your mouths that Jesus is Lord and Savior! Pray to be forgiven ! Doing so you will become a full Christian , but you must then afterward stay loyal and keep the Law which was given to Moses! Its Written in Exodus ! Stay Loyal to the true living God Of Isreal till the end ! Glorify his Holy name with a honest and innocent heart joyfully ! It's written those who trust in the Lord, are truly happy ,In book of psalms!

Those that will be saved are being blessed according to their righteousness ! And The ones who are being cursed are the sinners who don't change their hearts. Turning from their sinful ways ! Just because you clame your a Christian but you are not keeping the Ten Commandments ! , you are certainly not saved !  Believe and become a  Christian in a prayer of forgiveness ,to our Father God Jahova ! , Ending the prayer in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ Amen!  The sinners will be caught off guard when Jesus Christ returns at that  unexpected time. Our God will slowly curse the rebellious by famine ; disease as a punishment till you realize you are rebelling against our God ! But if God says enough in his Just Judgment on a sinner and takes away such a persons opportunity to inherit the promises .will be cursed to eternal hell; second death of condemnation.Our Father the creator is a just God !He not Just about peace and love ! For which it's written ! But also a God of Justice ! \\nIt's not of Gods will , that man shall parish in the destruction !ex. In Book of John Chapter 3 verse 16 !

Be of God cheer this is actually good news ! It's god's mercy that he'd loved to show you ! And bless you abundantly ! But ignoring our Gods offer to live according to your own will , Its a warning to all man and women in all nations. These are the end days ! Revelation is here! Don't get caught in sin by ignoring this message of our Gods Instructions to surrender your lives and live by faith! Keep The Ten Commandments as it's the way to eternal salvation !

pOZ5FrTMQMA,"Grace, i'm a fan of yours. I enjoyed mostly every single song that you wrote. But there's something bothering me. I find it many of your studio version songs (Sick of Being Told, So Much More Than This, Gossip Girl) used too much effects. I don't find it bad or anything, but personally i think its better if it stays simple. Just you, and your ukelele. No effects.\\n\\n I enjoyed those songs, but when i see you perform the simple acoustic way (Ed Sheeran's A Team, your whole AGT performances, your iHeart Radio performances), its so BEAUTIFUL. There's something more to it, it drawn people to you. Those performances so magical, so beautiful and i don't understand what that is. And i think its better for your studio versions song stay that way. I'm not a music expert or something, just my opinion. \\n\\nNo matter what i always love you and will always support you!

I have to keep a cup near me constantly. You can really see it in your face how much you have lost. Do you get cold a lot? I used to constantly be hot and now... everyone around me sweats and is miserable in this Florida heat and I am over her like, I guess it is warm.

YKgY0zQnqcU,They claim Award shows are Racist but why not Boycott the Liberals they do run these Bull shit shows & now they want to fool the Brain dead Audience by letting more minorities win lately üòÅ,1,0
YKgY0zQnqcU,"Lol his comment is flying over all of your heads... both the liberals and the trump supporters. He is exposing the reverse racism, or just plain racism that is occurring in an attempt towards diversification. Through pressure by the left, companies and markets like Hollywood are overcorrecting by giving minorities extra points just because they are minorities. And what makes them minorities? The color of their skin. The racist policy of Affirmative action is causing less qualified minorities to take the place of higher qualified demographics for the sake of diversity. Qualified Whites and Asians are being denied acceptance to universities because there are too many whites and asians. So what do universities do? In order to get more minorities they have to reduce their standards. This is the definition of racism. Being denied because of the color of your skin. Donald Glover showed that he is intelligent and aware of the idea that Hollywood will give awards to blacks just to show how equal they are and to look good in front of the left and the press. If youre on the right im sure you agree that this is a problem, so i don't understand why you're triggered by this. Also, if you're on the left, I don't see why you think this was such a bag on Trump 1. I think he was being sarcastic when he said Trump made blacks the most oppressed. 2. Even if he believes that, which is really dumb, I don't mind because at least he acknowledges how that has given minorities certain privileges, which as a typical leftist, you probably wont agree. I don't support Donald Trump so I don't give a fuck about anyone not liking him, but some of the Trump jokes by celebrities are so pathetic because it's obvious they just want attention and to look good. This joke however was funny and original.",1,0

YKgY0zQnqcU,To make blacks feel special and excepted we will make sure to give them plenty of award's.  I want to give them a factual award. Half of all abortions are from black women. Whites are 28 more times likely to be killed by blacks then the other way around. White women get raped by the thousands every year by black men. 98% of whites never owned slaves. Most blacks are part of the grievance industry. I'm sure you feel so good using your skin color as a form of power and intimidation.,0,0

pOZ5FrTMQMA,"Grace, i'm a fan of yours. I enjoyed mostly every single song that you wrote. But there's something bothering me. I find it many of your studio version songs (Sick of Being Told, So Much More Than This, Gossip Girl) used too much effects. I don't find it bad or anything, but personally i think its better if it stays simple. Just you, and your ukelele. No effects.\\n\\n I enjoyed those songs, but when i see you perform the simple acoustic way (Ed Sheeran's A Team, your whole AGT performances, your iHeart Radio performances), its so BEAUTIFUL. There's something more to it, it drawn people to you. Those performances so magical, so beautiful and i don't understand what that is. And i think its better for your studio versions song stay that way. I'm not a music expert or something, just my opinion. \\n\\nNo matter what i always love you and will always support you!

Whites are 28 more times likely to be killed by blacks then the other way around. White women get raped by the thousands every year by black men. 98% of whites never owned slaves. Most blacks are part of the grievance industry. I'm sure you feel so good using your skin color as a form of power and intimidation.,0,0

pOZ5FrTMQMA,"Grace, i'm a fan of yours. I enjoyed mostly every single song that you wrote. But there's something bothering me. I find it many of your studio version songs (Sick of Being Told, So Much More Than This, Gossip Girl) used too much effects. I don't find it bad or anything, but personally i think its better if it stays simple. Just you, and your ukelele. No effects.\\n\\n I enjoyed those songs, but when i see you perform the simple acoustic way (Ed Sheeran's A Team, your whole AGT performances, your iHeart Radio performances), its so BEAUTIFUL. There's something more to it, it drawn people to you. Those performances so magical, so beautiful and i don't understand what that is. And i think its better for your studio versions song stay that way. I'm not a music expert or something, just my opinion. \\n\\nNo matter what i always love you and will always support you! Thanks!\\n\\n(sorry for my english)",0,4

4YX_1wql-Xw,"throughout my many years of experience, people like this man woman thing don't want to be told how to live, even though the bible clearly states that this kind of shit is wrong. We're all sinners, but there's a very clear line with this and if you don't see this person as evil and disturbing then there's something wrong with you, because THIS isn't normal and this isn't how we as men are supposed to function in society. Also to educate you, the aids virus is primarily transmitted through gays and transexuals, a disease which has destroyed many people, and families lives. Here's a scenario for you, a bisexual man unknowingly has sex with a man that has aids. then, without telling the next girl he's about to have sex with that he's bisexual, he gives an innocent girl aids when she could have just been trying to find the love of her life. Bisexual man never speaks to girl again. And in the quest for a new love, this girl eventually has sex with someone else a few months down the line with someone she's fallen in love with. She now has a broken heart and accidentally ruined another man's life. The girl now battles depression and (for the sake of my story) commits suicide because her life is ruined. These types of things that I just described happen every single day and it's a sad reality. People need to wake up and stop being blinded by the media telling you it's all okay to do these things...and how much damage it can actually do to people. With a disease like aids you would think the world would wake up even more. But something is really wrong with our society right now where people think it's okay to do this or act like this guy when 9 years ago it was a completely different world. This shit doesn't happen in Europe either.",0,0

6gwM9v_OwUc,Honestly this was a great idea to expose this particular generation to this show. That said I did hear alot of closed mindedness from some of the elders (not all) . Forget about the drag part think about the masses of people that can relate to the stories and how much positivity it has brought to the LGBTQ community via education on the real stories that happen and how Rupaul himself has helped all these individuals succeed in their lives and because of Rupaul hundreds of Queens currently have successful careers and can provide for their families. Also not to forget how many people that have taken their own lives for not being accepted. Now they feel like they have a voice in the real world (people going through the same thing) . I have more to say I'll just leave it at that.,11,1

Yes, and I wish she was more professional and focused on her job instead of trying to be a diva all the time, but she's achieved so many things and she shouldn't be vilified in the way she is.",35,3

Leaving a iconic artist who had complained about technical issues on the night to flounder for the world to see, making VIRAL news which is all networks care about these days.

The thing is, Mariah has nothing to prove to anybody, she's had great success and she should be respected. Do I believe she's not on the right track right now? Yes, and I wish she was more professional and focused on her job instead of trying to be a diva all the time, but she's achieved so many things and she shouldn't be vilified in the way she is.",38,3

q8b5mciIDnA,I was skeptical at first about the sabotage claims but it really is shady as hell that ABC didn't cut to commercial after they realized she couldn't hear. They didn't even edit the performance out of the west coast airing. Like... Ashlee Simpson after her SNL debacle was shown more respect by the network. Shady shady shady,18,1
q8b5mciIDnA,"They're the best so I don't think they made mistakes - she didn't say they messed up dickweed...she said they did it on purpose which means you've missed the point entirely. If they're the best and know what they're doing why did they keep it rolling? Leaving a iconic artist who had complained about technical issues on the night to flounder for the world to see, making VIRAL news which is all networks care about these days.

_qb4_uvYSG0,"Why is Patriotism Important?\\nPatriotism is important because, without patriots, a country would fail. Only a true patriot would willingly lay down his or her life for their country while staying true no matter what. In essence, a real American patriot supports and defends the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and bears true faith and allegiance to the same.\\nPatriotism is the glue that binds a country. Without patriots, nations would be in chaos and citizens would be enslaved by other countries. Patriotism helps citizens to appreciate the enormous efforts accomplished and sacrifices made by the heroes before them in order to attain the freedoms and rights they enjoy today.\\nPatriotism helps the public to strive for excellence, encourages citizens to take part in the nation‚Äôs decision-making, and helps in maintaining peace within the country as well as fighting the various destructive issues that threaten national security.\\nA patriot is also concerned with not just saluting the flag, singing the anthem, or reciting the pledge of allegiance, but a true patriot is involved with their nation‚Äôs advancement in general. This means that he or she is able to identify the issues that hinder a nation‚Äôs growth and development, in addition to the willingness to exert selfless efforts to make those tough changes.\\nOur children learn much of their values and indeed worldview from their parents, the culture in which they are raised, and the companions they choose to associate with. So if you want to see a strong nation, thriving economy and a morally sound country at large, we all must do our part to instill in our children the importance of patriotism. For without it, countries like America will not last much longer, at least not as her Founding Fathers envisioned.\\nFreedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.

But when a group chooses to openly protest against hate and police brutality, they are condemned. Grow up people this is still America, No matter how much or current leader wants to make us the NEW RUSSIA. A place where you have few rights. A place where they can imprison anyone they consider to be a problem. I may not condone their forum, but i also see for most of them they little other forum available to them.

q8b5mciIDnA,"Give it up with Mariah already, things just went wrong that night and only she knows what happened exactly. The thing is, Mariah has nothing to prove to anybody, she's had great success and she should be respected. Do I believe she's not on the right track right now? Yes, and I wish she was more professional and focused on her job instead of trying to be a diva all the time, but she's achieved so many things and she shouldn't be vilified in the way she is.",42,3
q8b5mciIDnA,Ryan are you a musician? You said yourself you couldn't hear yourself with the crowd. Imagine singing with that kind of noise? You have to be able to hear yourself to sing. Ryan doesn't get it bcuz he can't sing.,28,5

q8b5mciIDnA,"They're the best so I don't think they made mistakes - she didn't say they messed up dickweed...she said they did it on purpose which means you've missed the point entirely. If they're the best and know what they're doing why did they keep it rolling? Leaving a iconic artist who had complained about technical issues on the night to flounder for the world to see, making VIRAL news which is all networks care about these days. All networks have contingency protocols for when things like this occur, why didn't they utilize them? So that we stay talking about it to this day.",46,8
q8b5mciIDnA,I was skeptical at first about the sabotage claims but it really is shady as hell that ABC didn't cut to commercial after they realized she couldn't hear. They didn't even edit the performance out of the west coast airing. Like... Ashlee Simpson after her SNL debacle was shown more respect by the network. Shady shady shady,20,1

q8b5mciIDnA,That ended Mariah's career u fortunately,6,12
q8b5mciIDnA,"It shouldnt be their responsibility to fix her fuck up. It was malicious or anything she didnt come in because she missed her cue and they didnt restart for her (it was a LIVE show) so she just needs to put her big girl britches on and deal with it.

_qb4_uvYSG0,üòÇüòÇ gotta admit trump is having fun with it,0,0
_qb4_uvYSG0,I got a idea Mr president take the millions they all make and give it to Americans who work and deserve it and make them work their buts off to make minimum wage this would solve poverty in America and give Americans happiness and encourage them to follow their dreams and America could be great again,0,0
_qb4_uvYSG0,this is why Americans don't trust the media no more so liberal & biased against president Trump! racism still exists cuz the media keeps throwing gasoline on the fire,0,0
_qb4_uvYSG0,"Why is Patriotism Important?\\nPatriotism is important because, without patriots, a country would fail. Only a true patriot would willingly lay down his or her life for their country while staying true no matter what. In essence, a real American patriot supports and defends the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic, and bears true faith and allegiance to the same.\\nPatriotism is the glue that binds a country. Without patriots, nations would be in chaos and citizens would be enslaved by other countries. Patriotism helps citizens to appreciate the enormous efforts accomplished and sacrifices made by the heroes before them in order to attain the freedoms and rights they enjoy today.\\nPatriotism helps the public to strive for excellence, encourages citizens to take part in the nation‚Äôs decision-making, and helps in maintaining peace within the country as well as fighting the various destructive issues that threaten national security.\\nA patriot is also concerned with not just saluting the flag, singing the anthem, or reciting the pledge of allegiance, but a true patriot is involved with their nation‚Äôs advancement in general. This means that he or she is able to identify the issues that hinder a nation‚Äôs growth and development, in addition to the willingness to exert selfless efforts to make those tough changes.\\nOur children learn much of their values and indeed worldview from their parents, the culture in which they are raised, and the companions they choose to associate with. So if you want to see a strong nation, thriving economy and a morally sound country at large, we all must do our part to instill in our children the importance of patriotism. For without it, countries like America will not last much longer, at least not as her Founding Fathers envisioned.\\nFreedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it was once like in the United States where men were free.

The only way is  God Yahushua ! churches will not speak of hell because they're afraid of scaring people or not have enough people in their churches... This is a deception from the Devil, he knows if you know the truth about hell you will repent and come to God.

f09ne0W6MZU,"You can tell she's in her head and holding herself back. She's not doing this with confidence like she does her WWE entrance, Roll that body girl! Im gonna vote, hopefully she doesn't get eliminated. Now is the time to break out of comfort zone and give it her all, instead of playing safe. It can be hard at first being new to these kind of dances. But that's what this competition is about, learning it, growing, and giving it your all. Be confident, even if you make a mistake it can be fixed. But what can't be worked on, is when you're not showing your full potentional. Also Nikki needs to stop being weird about dancing with another man. You have to be close, thats apart of dancing, its holding her back. Im pretty sure John understands, he acts in movies. And they were definitely underscored compared to other dances.",2,1

3X3xtRNb20s,"I'm trying to understand this concept, so I replay it. I get that it's rather different from when you normally hear a softer song with such a....detailed music video, but honestly I think it does fit it well, because the song isn't all just a soft type, David guetta's addition gave it more of a upbeat feel so I'm willing to give this a chance. I love this song, but I never heard it play on the radio, I hope that now with this new music video they will start playing it more often :DD....I actually heard this while I was shopping ....at toys r us don't ask. But I guess not understanding something the first time makes u want to understand it even more so...I don't think this was a stupid concept, I think the meaning, from what I understand, ties in well with what is being shown. Atleast it's not showing something totally irrelevant to the song lyrics.",0,0

Read The Daily Bread prayer Matthew chapter 6, song of Moses Exodus chapter 15 Luke 9 :23 - 27 and John 3:16. \\n\\nImportant you must watch on YouTube - marriage supper of the Lamb by Susan Davis words from God Revelation 19 :7-9, this will guide you to be in God's Will and how to be saved. she's a true Prophet /teacher of God, she has more videos must-see.\\n\\n2. not make thee any Graven image or likeness of any thing in heaven (statues Jesus Mary or angels Etc) In Earth (statues person ceramics Pagan Moab Molech sun baal plant animal Beast fowl in the air Etc )and in the waters (sea creatures etc) , Nor bow thyself down and serve them (if you have them in your life you're serving them).\\n\\n3. not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.\\n\\nalso saying: omg OMGoosh OMGoodness etc, profane JC or the Holy ghost, mocks, curse, saying Jesus and this and that for money profits or show for men, blasphemy God or the Holy Ghost. Like the movies media shows and the pope does, people saying OMG left and right every day. That devil mocks God's ways and the Bible... Like DNA mixing marriages rainbow scarecrows cloning e t c. Read Isaiah 5:20. \\n\\n4. keep Sabbath day (Saturday), keep it Holy, nor do any Works (job spend shop club party cook clean Etc)\\n\\n5. Honor thy Father (also God )and thy mother .\\n\\n6. not kill (hatred in your heart, you already killed).\\n\\n7. not commit adultery( fornication, lust after or porn too). read Matthew 5:28.\\n\\npeople committing adultery with God, by having friendship with the World by; technology, idolatry, what man says instead of Bible says, following... Trusting and focusing on the world... Instead of God! This is the devil's plan, plaining for the future plans... Our future is God!, entertainments, celebrities TV radio talk show web shows, Church and Christians shows- supposed to be a house of God... It became a house of :devils, profits off God, false Jesus teachings, witchcraft, idolatry, no Holy Ghost, mixing with the world lukewarm, lovers of money instead of God, tax exemptions, clubs, new-age Pharisees. ,Government- people feeding into their circus of lies and their Illuminati puppets don't trust them. Is the world Ways, shows, idolatry and the devil and his traps worth going to hell for?! read James 4:4, 1 John 2:15 - 16, John 8:44, 1 Peter 5:8, Luke 8: 12, Hosea 4 :1-10 2 Peter 2 :1-3, Joshua, 24:15, mark 10:21, Matthew 6:24, Revelation 220 - 23 and all chapter 18. you're also making them your idols making sacrifices money time worship praise or blood unto your show host( idols). also illuminati puppets... You know them by their fruits... They will ask for money donation selling marketing  profits ratings Fame lifestyle Fortune.\\n\\nDeuteronomy 18:10 - 13 talks about :divinations, Observer of times, enchanter, Witchcrafts, Charmers, Wizards, consulter with familiar spirits , necromancer- any kind of : holidays astrology fortune tellers future tellers Ouija boards sorceries psychics magic vampires horror films fairytale creatures puppets rituals seducing people or the dead any vanity chasing or communicating with the Dead tattoos Cuts marks fantasy things eat blood (also in Meats ) or any evil doings Etc...are Abomination to God. Demons enter these things ,idols and people. you living in sin you going to bring demons into your life. Clean your house get rid of all the idols even kids stuff.\\n\\n8. not steal.\\n\\n9.  Not bear false witness (lies ).\\n\\n10. not covet (desires or take other people's stuff).\\n\\n Jesus added another commandment love thy neighbor as yourself Matthew 22:39. \\n\\nNot telling people the truth, you're not loving Thy Neighbor tell people about God his kingdom the Rapture the Bible words, marriage supper ,to repent, live holy be holy, the Holy Ghost you need it to be Rapture Ready it's your oil lamp read the ten virgins in Matthew in the Bible ask God to give you the Holy Ghost, Ten Commandments, be humble, forgive everyone love everyone, talk about hell, liveknowlove God Yahushua. what if you're not saved, wouldn't you want to know the truth? tell people put it on your car t-shirts paper email videos Facebook Twitter tell your family and friends Neighbors Etc... Help bring people to God and try to keep em from hell.\\n\\nyou deny  God, he will deny you. let no man deceive you. saved always saved, saying the lord's name left and right, God is just love he's more than just love if you read the Bible and you have a relationship with God you would know that , going to church, by doing good works they're your works it's not God's will you have to ask God day-by-day what he wants from you for the day, Jesus died on the cross so you could sin left and right as much as you want, what man says, after you die you're going to live in heaven, when you don't have a relationship down here on Earth with God what makes you think you're going to spend eternity in heaven? these not going to save you these lies from pit of Hell. The only way is  God Yahushua ! churches will not speak of hell because they're afraid of scaring people or not have enough people in their churches... This is a deception from the Devil, he knows if you know the truth about hell you will repent and come to God. I tell you people need to be scared people lost the fear of God that's what's wrong with this world today. Sinners and pride won't enter Heaven... Even race, Christian, American Pride Etc.\\n\\nsee on YouTube 3 -days of darkness Sixth Seal in Revelation ,David Wilkerson videos, people having visions and dreams of Yahushua/Jesus coming Rapture act 2:17, God's word for 2017! Urgent prophecy!, and judgment! By Amightywind,God warns get out east coast, Earth after the Rapture vision, hell is real, idolatry videos, rid idols ,false blue beam Rapture, aliens are demons and fallen angels, weather events -floods (days of Noah) earthquakes volcanoes fires and hurricanes Etc... It's God waking people up to repent! We are in the end time days now read all Matthew and Revelations, Book of Enoch Hebrews 11:5, mark of the beast (RFID is here now don't take it in or on your body), government tracking you, FEMA camps, vatican evil, mind control, false teachers and Illuminati (devil minions ) are in everything :food drinks shows Illuminati puppets government's churches companies kids :toys Disney movies music sacrifices abductions abortions games ., celebrities...

It can be hard at first being new to these kind of dances. But that's what this competition is about, learning it, growing, and giving it your all. Be confident, even if you make a mistake it can be fixed. But what can't be worked on, is when you're not showing your full potentional. Also Nikki needs to stop being weird about dancing with another man. You have to be close, thats apart of dancing, its holding her back. Im pretty sure John understands, he acts in movies.

Video games are hindered at delivering plot - players get in the way of the execution and often the solution is to put limitations on their interactions during important scenes. Games are fantastic, however, at delivering meaning, subtext, ideas and feelings. They can envelop you into a world. They can extend multiple threads of questlines, dialogue, player actions and music into an almagamation together. They can be messy and inconsistent, while still being evocative. Games are where I go now for media with ideas now. Most recently I've been enthralled by the game *Nier Automata* _which takes a sci-fi apocalypse, and makes it about the folly of determinism._",0,0

Im gonna vote, hopefully she doesn't get eliminated. Now is the time to break out of comfort zone and give it her all, instead of playing safe. It can be hard at first being new to these kind of dances. But that's what this competition is about, learning it, growing, and giving it your all. Be confident, even if you make a mistake it can be fixed. But what can't be worked on, is when you're not showing your full potentional. Also Nikki needs to stop being weird about dancing with another man. You have to be close, thats apart of dancing, its holding her back. Im pretty sure John understands, he acts in movies. And they were definitely underscored compared to other dances.",2,1

There's a depth to them that you really don't get in sci-fi stories anymore.

That doesn't happen without a lot of good people directing the efforts of their lives in beneficial, productive ways.

And then I went to the cinema to see Wind River (would highly recommend) which is about family, and how to be a family when the world takes it away from us, and how we can fight and be strong and still lose.

Or a 12 gauge OO buckshot?\\nIf he flew a hot air balloon or an airplane too high up into the atmosphere, just to the edge of space, where planes can not fly any higher?\\n(Of all of these, the one I'm most interested in is: What if he flew outside of the Milky Way Galaxy and tried to get back to our solar system. \\nJust a hint to get started: The escape velocity of the Milky Way is approximately 1.2 Million Miles per hour!\\nThe Galaxy is about 100,000 ly across by approximately 300 ly thick. It is traveling towards the Andromeda Galaxy at a rate of somewhere between 70 and 75 miles per second!\\nBut what would happen to him outside of the protection of the galaxy? Would there be a different amount of radiation etc outside the galaxy? Could he ever get back in the Milky Way? Since the galaxy is traveling so fast, would that be similar to jumping out of a racecar that is traveling at 350 MPH? This scenario brings up way too many questions! But, that's what would make it so interesting.)",0,0

D6oaRAgdslE,"Being that it was night fire, I am assuming any amateur would probably have trouble hitting their target even with NV optics. So this must be why paddock used this fire option to increase his chances of making contact. I bet he felt like a god from his vantage point while aiming down on innocent Americans.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,He didn't have to be accurate you jerk! He had a whole crowd full of people to hit. All he had to do was get the rounds in the general direction and eventually he would kill or maim someone. I like guns but you're making excuses for this device and your not being very honest by splitting hairs!,0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"Since the weapon was fired at a downward angle(likely closer to 60-65 degrees), the bullets travel significantly faster and are slightly more accurate by simple physics association. This guy completely forgets the laws of physics.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"...And how does this dude suddenly now know anything about firearms? Seems to me that he knew plenty. I mean, how much does one need to officially know to say one knows 'enough' about firearms? He's had over 20-years of ownership. . .",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,These stocks are accurate-enough against a group of undesirables at around 30 feet.,0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,Ok. I guess I get the video? Except he wasn't trying to be accurate at all with his shooting. His target area was so big that the bump stock did the job just fine. What's the point of the video? To prove Stephen Paddock wasn't a real marksman? He killed almost 60 people and wounded over 500. Sounds like he hit his marks to me.,0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,Yea I was thinking same... very wrong what he said... oh he was a jack ass he used a bump stock to shoot dead them poor souls WTF like he should used a proper fully!... should get rid this video!,0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,You asshole why do you need a assault rifle for self defence? Only a glock will di instead of pilling up big guns hoping to cowardly defend yrself frm illusionary mob of balck dudes or Zombies. For people like you America is suffering frm this plague home grown terrorism.,0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"the ppl don't like your video must be the retard.\\ngun doesn't kill ppl by itself, only ppl could kill others.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"you're saying it's not a viable option for accuracy. he didn't need to be accurate. he was firing into an enclosed crowd. the amount of a munition he had with him suggests to me that accuracy was not a consideration in his plan.\\n\\nAlso, for someone who wanted a maximum casualty rate, I find it weird how he committed suicide 10 minutes before the cops rushed his room. Why didn't he keep firing until the cops rushed the room and then take the cops with him? \\n\\nHow long did he think he would be up there for if he was planning to get away? Why not just one rifle? Why so many?",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"I'm super pro 2A, but even I'll admit the bump stock is just a technicality to get around the full auto ban.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,There is no difference: bump fire stocks are just as unnecessary as firearms. Get rid of it! Gun nuts are sick.,0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"Wad da fuck fully automatic is inaccurate anyway, people who buy these stocks probably finds firing automatic on a semi platform fun that‚Äôs pree much it",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"The shooter wasn't interested in being a marksman or a sniper... he was interested in killing as many people as he could before he himself died, and that nifty little device allowed him to do it. So, tell me, why are these things now flying off the shelves in record numbers when the only use for them is to fire off as many rounds as you can into your preferred crowd... sorry, 'target'. As for your prayers? How about something that is actual real? Give up some of your precious 'rights' to save lives.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"Not everyone on the left wants to ban all guns. For that matter, not everyone on the right loves guns. A lot of us on the left just want to ban this bump stock. As you pointed out in this video, there isn't a very good practical civilian application for this accessory.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"He fired at the human equivalent of fish in a barrel from high ground. Less accurate fire was probably preferable for max damage. Maybe he used bump fire stocks because it was easier than getting full auto rifles and he could fire a lot more rounds by switching from rifle to rifle and just holding down a finger until each ran dry. Who cares about accuracy when the objective is bloodshed?\\nBut, there is a definite agenda by the media, and I would say further up, behind this shooting. My feeling is that it is yet another instance of planting fear in the people, fear of once highly safe public places, fear of terrorists in our own country, fear that the government is not watching us closely enough to keep us safe. First day after the shooting the media was all abuzz about changing the definition of what constitutes terrorism which was laying it on the people a little thick in my opinion...\\n\\nI've never fired a weapon, but I have come to appreciate a literal interpretation of the Second Amendment. Who uses them is really the key to what makes a firearm a killing device and the truth is that the gun lobby and right wing politicians don't want to establish any specifics on what constitutes a legal gun owner less that definition be subjectively interpreted and reneged over time.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,ABC News edited this clip to make their point.\n1:15\nhttps://youtu.be/fU6x4IfWuso,0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"Seems to me after watching this video that the LV guy knew exactly what they were doing to their firearm. They were shooting at a huge crowd, not a single target, with the aim of causing chaos and killing and wounding random people. For him, accuracy was a small price to pay. Thank you for demonstrating that if you wanted to shoot single targets, if you wanted to be a good marksman, you wouldn't ever use the bump stock in rapid-fire mode, unmounted. I agree with you that no right-thinking person would ever want these. You wouldn't use one to take an animal or defend your family. The only people who -would- use one are wannabe terrorists!\\n\\nIf someone made a weapon mod that only wackjob crazies and terrorists wanted to use, dammit we -should- ban it.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"Now I understand, the Vegas shooter was a nut job and a coward for using the wrong equipment and for not being a good shot. If he had fired from 25 yards on semi automatic he would have been more effective and so would that have made him a hero? At least the next shooter will be better informed now and be more effective.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"I Don't know why everyone is making a big deal of something that never happened, just look at all the YouTube videos showing its just a Hoax! Lmao",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"Fully auto fire is not for accuracy , it for suppressive fire or firing into a cluster of people...which the psycho did. It is more psychological than practical.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"in sumary, this expert is criticising how inconcistent the las vegas shooter was, by having no experience and poor selection of firearm equipment.  You are not helping yourself, morron.... üôÑ",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"Honestly, if I was planning to shoot indiscriminately into a crowd of civilians, I wouldn't give a damn about accuracy. This has just demonstrated the bump stock as a viable option for firing a ton of rounds into a crowd at high speed.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"Everyone is missing the point of this video.  It's not an endorsement of the device.  It's demonstrating that using the device isn't enhancing lethality and banning the device is an irrelevant emotional knee jerk that does nothing to stop psychopaths and terrorists.  Fine, ban the bump stocks.... then figure out what to ban when a psychopath terrorists commits such a horrific event without a bump stock....",1,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"I dont think he was trying to hit individual people... i think he was trying to hit as many as possible in a huge crowd, and that makes this a great attachment for that goal.\\n\\nI still think he was setup and this was a multi person job due to the amount of evidence and misinformation the news is trying to feed us.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,This wasn‚Äôt a very nice video,1,0
D6oaRAgdslE,He was looking to cause as much damage as possible not one shot one kill so he actually made a very well thought out choice for maximum overall carnage..,0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"Goes to show, they just don't get it",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"With thousands of people clustered together..the shooter DID NOT need to be accurate. I'm pro gun and a NRA member. However ,  these ''bump stop'' mod's should be banned .",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,Bump Stock should follow along with the automatic weapons modification laws. Illegal.,0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"I think this video has forgotten that when the target is a half-acre of people standing shoulder-to-shoulder, accuracy is far less important than getting more rounds downrange before anyone realises what's happening.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,You effectively just proved why these dont need to be legal. Thank you,0,0

D6oaRAgdslE,The more a rapid fire weapon throws the bullets around the better its called the beaten zone. wanking on about inaccuracy is stupid it's what that cunt in Vegas wanted!,0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,Dude you're so full of shit. Obviously it worked for him. Was like shooting fish in a barrel!,0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,So I'm confused. Your saying this is impractical for anything but mass murder.... So there is no need to ban it. \n\nAnd yes I'm being partially sarcastic but i would really like a response. Because I would really like to understand the overall point of this video. Because just from the end of the video I feel like he thought he had made a good point against gun control or something.,0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,We should ban guns. We should solve our problems with fist fights. Lol imaging Trump and Kim Jong going at it.,0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"Dude, what are you actually saying? That if the Las Vegas shooter was smarter and knew more about firearms he would have chosen to not use a bumpfire stock, so he would have done a better job with killing MORE people? I do not get your arguments AT ALL :l",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"What I got from this video:\\n1. The shooter is a fuckin moron for not taking his time making semi-auto, accurate shots, lemme show yall something cool!\\n2. *Shows awesome bumpfire montage that simulates automatic fire.\\n3.That shooter was ignorant! If i was him, i coulda killed more people since i was more precise with semi auto!\\n4. Liberals are cunts, fuck the left, theyve been talking about gun control and want to debate, but fuck them and their opinions",0,0

D6oaRAgdslE,"You can bump fire with your pants-belt-loops.  Done it before.  We gonna ban pant-belt-loops now to prevent psychopaths from killing people?  You do know that there are lasers that you can buy now that will cut right through a crowd of people.  Good thing he didn't have that..  nor the microwave gun, that would have fried their insides... ask DARPA.   Thing is, you should never disarm people who would give their lives to save you.  Why?  Because there are always psychopaths who want to do things like what Paddock was said to have done.  That's why gun control is a total fraud.

D6oaRAgdslE,"Hey, lefty, here, i like your videos, and i agree that there needs to be better answers then ban everything. So i agree, and i like hearing that youre open to the idea of having a conversation, We come up with a better idea than ban, and you come up with a better answer than just always no, and thats a conversation. The only thing i differ on is while i like guns and what they represent. You know the shooter wasnt going for accuracy he was going for spray fire into a crowd which the stock did very effectively. But i support guns, and i also support common sense controls on them, but i also agree that the first step is to educate yourself. So people who want to talk about bump stocks should watch your very informative video if they are ignorant to the tools they wish to speak about.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"The shots fired in Vegas sounded mechanical not cosmic, as you said shooting the \\nslid fire stock isn't consistent. \\nAnybody who's ever shot a gun with one of these stocks would know that you can't just pick up the gun and shoot it like it's fully automatic. You'd definitely need some time and practice behind these stocks. \\nThings don't add up, just saying.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"So - from this I gather even legallyarmedAmerica thinks bump stocks should be illegal. According to him, they are of no practical use to the marksman, and are simply used for indiscriminate shooting into a crowd. Awesome. Glad you're talking some sense. Now as an extension of your logic, high capacity magazines are equally stupid, and should also be summarily outlawed. Probably would have spared the lives of a few kids in Newtown, as someone could have stopped the shit stain when he went to reload. After all - pro life, right?\\n\\nAs far as liberals starting the gun debate with outlaw all guns. That's just dumb,  my friend. Anyone suggesting that is not an elected member of congress with a means to enact policy, and making bump stocks and high capacity magazines illegal just makes sense, and does not in any meaningful way detract from the NRA or gun manufacturer interpretation of the 2nd amendment. \\n\\nIt's been interesting to see the gun crowd trying a weave this narrative to distance themselves from this horrible tragedy, and only ending up with a lot of filler diatribe with very little meat on the bone. Come to think of it - he didn't really say whether those stocks should be illegal at all. I just inferred it from the hollow points he was attempting to make. Gun humor for the Win.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"Firing on auto or with a bump fire stock, isn't necessarily for accuracy. If you were a combat vet, you would recognize that. It's used to suppress enemy fire. A rapid volley of rounds, can overwhelm the enemy advance and ability to return fire, when you're advancing to their position. It keeps their heads down and unable to effectively return fire. It's really not for accuracy. So, it has its tactical value, and the vast majority of Americans that own these bump stocks are law abiding citizens. Good people.

D6oaRAgdslE,the entire mechanism is inaccurate and pointless for its intended use. Pre ban autos are expensive and great investment. Why allow this if it's such an awful product? I would never buy it personally because of the accuracy issue and think it's a stupid thing to even allow because of how ridiculous it is.\n\n(edit) I shoot for accuracy and enjoy the skill and feeling when you shoot accuracy.

D6oaRAgdslE,"This video is shit.  You say how poor, how inaccurate and how inconsistant a bump stock is.  Trying to defend the fact that a bump fire stock does not need to be outlawed.  The proof this video is crap is 59 dead and over 500 wounded.\\n\\nThe bump fire stock has one advantage.  Firing large amounts of ammo into a crowd.  Again 59 dead over 500 wounded.  Show me where 1 trained soldier in any army in the world has ever done that.  In under 10 minutes.\\n\\nYou say, the shooter knew nothing of accuracy and firearms.  Yet, obviously he knew way more than you ever will.  The shooter knew his limitations, chose a weapon with a bump stock and killed 59 people.\\n\\nBTW, jackass, he had a bi pod to help create a stable platform.  Yet, all of your shooting is standing.

This is simply a clever loophole which the jack ass in Las Vegas shot through to mow down a crowd of innocent people. It's a loophole that needs to be bricked up.

Currently there is NO state militia (much less a group of you and your buddies) that would be able to fight against the might of the US military.\\n\\nI ask you: Should you be allowed to control ICBMs? Should you have fighter jets?  Nuclear submarines? Apache helicopters? Simple mortars/rockets? Fully automatic weapons?  Bump stock semi-autos? Where do you draw the line?\\n\\nAt what point do you feel that you would be able to combat a serious US military offensive on yourself or your kin?  Those abilities are what the 2nd amendment was put in place to protect. The idea that you can defend yourself from a US military attack is a fallacy during this day and age.  You cannot use the 2nd amendment the way it was meant to be used. \\n\\nYou cannot keep up with the federal military on any scale regardless of monetary input.  The US government has ensured that not only can YOU not keep up monetarily, but other NATIONS around the world cannot keep up.\\n\\nYou can keep holding on to your semi-auto rifles and hand guns... If it comes down to it, you are screwed. You can stock all the ammunition you want. If the government calls in a predator drone strike on your location, you are done.  The NRA knows this, and so does the government.  Who do you think you are fooling... yourself?\\n\\nThe 2nd amendment is a joke.  \\n\\nYou can keep spraying bullets at a junk car in your back yard or at your favorite gun range.  You can keep thinking you will spray bullets from your AR-15 at the plane that is 50,000 ft. in the sky over your house that is dropping bombs on you.  \\n\\nThe fact of the matter is that the 2nd amendment is so out of date that it is not even a consideration.\\n\\nThe 2nd amendment can't work the way it was intended to work without US citizens having access to MUCH higher power weapons than we are currently allowed.  \\n\\nIf you enjoy it for sport, then go for it.  If you think you are defending your freedom against a potentially oppressive government then wake the fuck up.\\n\\nEnjoy your target practice.",0,0

If he is a usual example of weapons owners then everyone has reason to be concerned, he positively revels in blasting off a few rounds for show",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,I knew these stocks were going to get some high profile attention at some point. As soon as it was used  in a crime it would get  banned. Even the NRA doesn't like this thing. It's not safe and just lets you spray ammunition in a general area. It's just exploiting a loophole.,0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"This guy says the shooter made a poor choice in using the bump stock because it is ineffective and not accurate. You don't need to be accurate when u are shooting into a group of people, and from the numbers of dead and wounded i would say the bump stock was very effective",0,0

Also, the fact that it's inaccurate would just make it better in the case of shooting into a crowd. I'm not all about gun control and shit, I'm just pointing out some pretty clear biases. If you want to get your point across and seem credible, you've shouldn't try and so obviously bend things in favour of your beliefs. It makes everything you say seem less reliable. Don't get me wrong, I love shooting guns as much as anybody and I'd be thoroughly disappointed to have such a fun hobby taken away because there's shit humans in the world.

Lead raining down from above is deadly.  An increase of fire only makes that more deadly.  I agree these should not be illegal.  However, I believe they should have the same background checks as Handguns.  In the Las Vegas shooting however, it wouldn't have worked, considering he would have passed with flying colors.

If someone wanted to cause mass carnage from an elevated vantage point by firing into a packed crowd then a bump stock and high capacity mags are the perfect mods for a semiauto rifle.\n\nThere is no argument here... You're a moron if you think bump stocks should not be banned. After all they are made specifically to side step the ban on full auto rifles by modding semi autos to act exactly like full autos. Full auto firearms were banned precisely to prevent massacres from occurring.

Lupe Fiasco was out there grimy too. u just wouldnt know it cause they seem like squares to the people who dont know them.\\n\\nALso, I think he was showing love to NY just because he was there. But honestly, Chicago showed more love to the South than anywhere. Also, Chicago culture influenced a lot of the culture on the East & West. Through music, gang culture, producing, you name it. Lets learn History and get it correct!",0,0

D6oaRAgdslE,"Well, at 3:34 of the video you say, These (bump stocks) are not viable options when it come to accuracy and try to be proficient with a firearm. ¬†OK... Not for shooting your bottles and plastic toros on a stick. ¬†But unloading one with the bump stock into a 25,000 person crown on a couple acres made it DEADLY AS FUCK. ¬†I'm pro 2nd. ¬†But this video is idiotic. ¬†You end it by saying the idiot shooter made a stupid choice using it and he obviously knew nothing about firearms. ¬†Well, his kill count is vastly out numbering yours. ¬†As you call him an idiot, ¬†Shooting DOWN on a huge crowd doesn't seem like it takes a lot of skill. ¬†And with a bump stock, seems a fuck lot easier. ¬†MORON!",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,Don‚Äôt give an inch. You can be assured that if one does agree to banning bump fire stocks they will most definitely come after more,0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"About gun control: i dont live in america so i dont know if there are such things. But as a suggestion: \\n1. There could be a psychologycal examination for people owning a gun\\n2. There could be an inteligence test (eg how to handle weapons, how to store them ...)\\n3. Thete should be a constant monitoring of your background/ mental health (a test eg. Every 2 years) \\n4. They should be regular unannounced home visits to check if your guns are stored correctly (in the gun safe)\\n\\nDont get me wrong i love shooting guns but its a little hard here in europe. And because of idots like him (las vegas shooter) its getting even harder.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"The liberals are here. They had to look up what a bump stock was because they refuse to get acquainted with their right to the second amendment. The number of guns has risen, the number of casualties has decreased. More guns=safer America.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"I will not go into the ethical or moral dilemma firing into a crowd of unarmed civilians.\\nTactically speaking, automatic weapons fire or anything like it (bump fire stocks) from an AR or AK platform is going to be  for target suppression; making the guy shooting at you stay under cover so you can move to a better/safer firing position or disengage from contact.\\nIt is not meant to be super accurate; it is going to push you back;  the barrel is going ride up.\\nThere is a reason that using auto-fire on the M16/M16A1 was so discouraged (except in the aforementioned instances) by the military that they had to engineer a way to keep young, stupid, Rambo-wannabe Soldiers and Marines from wasting ammunition; M16A2.\\nEven for weapons like the M60, M240, & M249, that was their primary purpose, target suppression.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,I'm not sure what you wanted to prove with this video.  It seems like you are in favor of keeping the bump stock as an option but the the whole video talk about how ineffective it is.  So you are in fact making a video of how dumb this this is in the first place unless you are just trying to spray bullets everywhere.,0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"It's understandable that everyone is upset about what was used to commit the cowardly massacre, however you can't blame the tool, if people want to do a mass murder they're going to do it, there's a little thing called the black market where you can literally get any weapon you want, this maniac could've easily gotten a light machine gun or a couple of fragmentation grenades. Point is, you can't ban things from criminals, the best course of action is to improve security.",0,0

D6oaRAgdslE,Honestly looked pretty deadly still. Problem is how can you regulate this? You can't. You could 3d print one easily.,0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"Not sure why this guy chooses to talk to his viewers like they can't see, and that these stocks are just totally useless. If you put one of these in someones hands that's hell bent on inflicting a bunch of carnage, that's exactly what they're gonna do, don't sit here and try to tell us how ineffective they are when we all just witnessed what they're capable of. The next psycho to use one of these on the public might not be 400 yards away, that was the only saving grace in Vegas, or we would've been talking about hundreds killed. I've been shooting guns for 40 years, and I own an AR15, but I get so sick of all the paranoid 2nd Amendment clowns talking about having their rights taken away, when no one has ever proposed to take away the 2nd Amendment...that's propaganda. But what people are talking about is making it impossible for these types of weapons to end up in the wrong hands. The argument is always that guns don't kill people, people do. I wonder if all these same people would have the same views if someone they love was just out for the evening enjoying a concert and was slaughtered. As someone who owns guns, I can honestly say there is no civilian use for this type of firepower, and if this shit wasn't being sold, we wouldn't have to worry about it ending up in the wrong hands...period!",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"Look, if you are using that stock when firing in a group, you can kill everyone in the group without aiming at every target.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"So, this guy obviously would be super accurate with a fully auto AR15/m4?? No. Any automatic weapon is subject to the same inaccuracy. \\n\\nThe Vegas shooter clearly intended to create chaos and instill terror. Why are you trying to divert attention from legal mods and say they are ineffective at marksmanship? \\n\\nEven a burst fire mode m16 will not be as accurate as a semi mode over 25m. \\n\\nServed in the military for 8 years. Pro 2nd Amendment.\\n\\n#gunnuts need to start owning up to the shit that they say",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"However, it does need to be pointed out: If you're trying to be accurate then, no, this wouldn't work very well. But if you're trying to mow down a dense crowd of people and don't care who you specifically hit then, yes, this would be highly effective.\\n\\nI always kinda wanted one for the holy shit, that was cool factor, but I could never justify the price to get one.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,Just another dumbass gun nut. His Logic for the Las Vegas situation is utterly stupid.,0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"Why can't these videos show one handed fire, one press of the trigger and show people that these do not fire multiple rounds with a single press. People that don't shoot can't likely understand the difference. All they see is rapid firing. Show these people one press of the trigger and that the gun doesn't behave like an auto.",0,0

D6oaRAgdslE,"You just proved that this bump stock system is very effective against large dispersed targets.....'like' a machine gun turned loose on a crowd.....your words 'stupid choice' are you kidding? For him clearly it was the perfect choice, twisted individual that he was. I am not left or political....i am a 23 year army veteran, a retired senior officer, wounded in the line of duty. I appreciate that firearms are part of the American identity, for good and bad (i do not however flatly accept the often 'grey' interpretation of the second amendment). I also know, that untrained people or people who do not have the capacity to use firearms responsibly,( even some soldiers), are a threat to the security and freedom of ordinary peace loving people. I am all for freedom, but freedom decided by all not just a few......i therefore propose a series of gun control referrendums by state, based on questions gained from lobbies and interest groups. This way, everybody has the opportunity to make their voices heard....but as in any free democratic society, the majority decision must be accepted and become law.",0,0

D6oaRAgdslE,"I don't think there is a conversation to be hand about gun laws in the US.\\nThe 2nd Amendment is pretty clear. Americans have a right to bear arms.\\n\\nGun control statistics(data from other countries) are also pretty clear: It only works when its universal.\\nRegional bans and restrictions are meaningless.\\nGun control works in Europe and elsewhere because guns are actually hard to obtain there, not only for law abiding citizens but also for criminals, so criminals usually choose either fake guns or different tools like knives, which are way less efficient killing tools and this brings down the numbers in statistics.\\nIn the US, where you have 300 million firearms already floating around, any type of regulation and restriction, especially when its just regional would have little to no effect, because the sheer abundance of firearms would make them easy to come by for decades to come even after a total ban.\\nThe counterargument by many is always that gun laws would only take guns away from law abiding citizens. Unless you find a way to get rid of the 300 million guns in the US, that would be true.\\n\\n\\nAnother point is that we always talk about gun control after mass shootings. But the truth is that mass shootings are only a tiny fraction of gun violence in the US, and an even tinier fraction of mass shootings is committed by certifiably mentally ill people.(People who were actually diagnosed before the shooting)\\nSo yeah, maybe it makes sense to ban bump-fire stocks or ban mentally ill people from buying guns, but ultimately these measures will do little to nothing to bring down the number of gun violence incidents in the US.\\nNone of these small scale regulations and restrictions will have any significant effect.\\n\\n\\nI don't think this debate has room to move anywhere.\\nI would just wish for a more honest debate.\\n1. Yes, gun control works, as proven by countless countries around the world.\\n2. No, it wouldn't work in the US, because the sheer amount of guns already available would make any ban meaningless for decades to come. \\n3. It might sound crass, but the thousands of gun related deaths and injuries are just the price the US has to pay for the 2nd Amendment. I wish pro gun advocates would have the guts to say it like that. Bill O'Reilly actually did say that recently. He say its the price of freedom. I give him credit for that.",0,0

For most gun owners agreeing that bump stocks need to registered as a machine gun (free for the grandfathered ones) will be no more distressing than a decision to ban flintlock blunderbusses or Gyrojet ammo.

D6oaRAgdslE,"Fully auto would be useful in a scenario where you are one against many. However, my personal experience and opinion, you don't want to hold down the trigger and spray and pray. Instead, 3-5 round bursts is more practical due to a couple reasons. One being that, with bursts, you still have enough accuracy to hit your target while sending more rounds down range at a faster rate. Second reason is that with smaller bursts the barrel won't get as hot so fast. Now, if there was a setting for burst on an AR15 that would be great but we don't. Even with a belt fed weapon, such as a 240B or M249, you still don't want to lay on the trigger too long because the barrel will get too hot. Again, 3-5 round bursts are more practical. I also think this guy is a little out of line for saying that anyone who uses one is a jackass. Maybe someone wants one because they like it. Or the fact that this is America and it's legal. I understand this guy's anger and frustration about the Vegas shooting, Im angry about it too, but his guy put personal feelings over facts.

The ten affected states were individually named in the second part (South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina). Not included were the Union slave states of Maryland, Delaware, Missouri and Kentucky. Also not named was the state of Tennessee, in which a Union-controlled military government had already been set up, based in the capital, Nashville. Specific exemptions were stated for areas also under Union control on January 1, 1863, namely 48 counties that would soon become West Virginia, seven other named counties of Virginia including Berkeley and Hampshire counties, which were soon added to West Virginia, New Orleans and 13 named parishes nearby. The Emancipation Proclamation was only for counties controlled by the Confederacy, slave counties and slave states controlled by the Union DID NOT free their slaves with the Emancipation Proclamation.",0,0

D6oaRAgdslE,I'm giving this a dislike because you missed so many shots at such a short distance. You said 25 yards? There's no excuse for that man. You need to practice more.,0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,Only a total jackass would use one of these.\nYeah...,0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"Yes I agree , when your shooting into a group of thousands of people you don‚Äôt need to be accurate, you just need to get rounds down range , it wasn‚Äôt a stupid choice it was perfect for his disgusting agenda...it was evil and demented and my prayers go out to everyone who was hurt by his evil acts. I don‚Äôt know what choice is best to prevent such acts but I hope we can come together in unity to just live life and enjoy what you have and to help others who are less fortunate.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"Look, I get what you're trying to say. But look at the conditions. In the machine gunner world, we have a term called enfilade. Also known as A machine gunner's wet dream. It refers to firing in a line from end to end and all of your intended targets are in that line (think of a bunch of bad guys lined up in a hallway, and all you have to do is fire straight down that hall way to hit all your targets). From a machine gunner's perspective, this guy had perfect if not nearly perfect conditions for inflicting high casualties through rapid fire, regardless of how that rapid fire was achieved. You're shooting at one target, relatively close range. Yes, rapid fire would be less effective for that scenario, because you're only shooting at one target. This guy was shooting at many MANY targets, very close together at a much longer distance. Semi auto fire would have been much less effective to put out the volume of fire needed to accomplish what he did. This guy was not stupid, he knew what he was doing. He knew what he was trying to accomplish and found a method to do so, and it proved to be very effective. There isn't much else, aside from using an actual machine gun (not just a fully automatic rifle, or a rifle modified with a bump fire stock) capable of a much higher rate of fire, or a higher caliber or both. You are correct in saying that a bump fire stock does not turn a rifle into a super weapon, but with those conditions, you don't need a super weapon. As a firearms enthusiast myself, but I still don't know what to think about a modification like this, or fully automatic firearms themselves. On the one hand this tragedy is a prime example of what they are capable of, but on the other hand tragedies of this magnitude are quite rare considering how prevalent firearms are in American society and how large our population is.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"Well, You are making a video about how the bump stock is not efficient for a good shooter willing to use their ammo reasonably at hitting a small target. So according to you, the bump stock is not an option responsible reasonable shooter would choose.\\nAt the same time, Las Vegas lunatic has proven bump stock quite efficient in dumping maximum amount of bullets in what he chose to have as an area target. Hitting almost 600 people in some 10 minutes is more than any single shooter in US have achieved before, isn't it?\\nSo if the device is not practical for responsible shooters and works well for a homicidal maniacs, maybe it would be wise to regulate it?",0,0

The second amendment never spoke about weapons of war or automatic weapons yet we twist the narrative as if to say everybody should be able to own these weapons.  Why. How many people need to die to get that these toys (and that's all they are, are adult toys) of the streets. Kill on.  Kill on.  Can't wait for the next mass shooting.

D6oaRAgdslE,"It's true crimes are not committed by guns but by humans who have no regard for human life. However, until we don't do something about the people who can have access to these guns I wouldn't want an unstable retard to have access to any type of modified rifle.\\n\\nIf this Vegas asshole would've had a California legal AR without any type of modifications. I think we can all agree that more people would have lived. Although a bump stock doesn't make a rifle an automatic it does give the rifle the ability to rapid fire giving some dip shit the opportunity to hurt many. \\n\\nIn my opinion don't ban the weapon but control it. No need for folks to have access to a fully automatic or a modified semi auto for rapid fire. No need for high capacity mags or whatever mods are out there.\\n\\nI think perhaps intensive psychological evaluation should be a requirement along with the background and yeah have the purchaser pay for it too. \\n\\nJust my opinion.",0,0

So basiclly the mainstream media obviously knows little or nothing about them but proposes that they should all be banned... That is the kind of stupidity that all anti-gunners have....Guns don't kill people, people kill people... There is no cure for stupid... Banning firearms only means more criminal use of guns because criminals don't buy guns from a registered gun dealer, they buy them off the black market... Therefore unarmed people¬†will be at their mercy...¬† Let's get to the root of the problem... The mainstream liberals have an agenda... Like all battlefield strategist the way to conquer is to divide the opposition...

D6oaRAgdslE,"Out of fairness..you do not need to use a gun to kill/injure that many people in a situation like that in Las Vegas. Honestly you could fill up a case of 22 ounce glass bottles w/gasoline, turn them into molotov cocktails in other words & hurl them on the crowd below. The point is that if a maniac wants to kill a mass amount of people in an urban setting he DOESN'T need a gun. Why not adress the fact that almost all of the people involved in mass shootings were on some sort of psyche meds & the most important fact, that before the psyche meds were handed out like candy, the USA didnt have these mass shooting on a regular basis.

D6oaRAgdslE,"A question for LegallyArmedAmerica:  You went to great lengths to demonstrate that you would have to be an idiot to use the Bump Fire Stock; and that is lacks accuracy for a serious shooter.  Why then would you have an objection to it being banned if it is so useless?  Also, could you provide a demonstration simulating what happened:  use a bump fire to spray a tight grouping of targets from an elevated position at a long range.  Unless I missed something the bump fire seem ideal for this kind of mass shooting.  Sadly, I suspect the Vegas shooter simply provided home grown terrorists with a demonstration of an effective murder method and that we will see a repetition of such crimes.",0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"The mass shooter really wasn't concerned with accuracy though, was he? He just wanted a way to shoot as many bullets down into a crowd of people as possible, and he used on of the bump stocks to do it. These stocks need banning before anyone else gets hurt because of them.",0,0

D6oaRAgdslE,"Thank you for your video. To me it was evident it was first an attack on civilians, our innocent loved ones, our fathers, mothers, daughters and grandparents etc, secondly the attack was on the Bill of rights, the second amendment and also the 4th amendment and the millions of Americans who have a birth right to live free and self protect. It truly didn't matter to this mentally evil man if he killed 5, 8, 58 or 58,000. He wanted to make a statement and it was a statement that only someone like him no matter if he was a lone wolf or was a left violent winger. We can go down the road to what's next, vehicles, knifes, fertilizer etc. If a sick individual wants to kill many people, they will find a way. Look what happened to the 1st officer of a A320 who drove his plane into the ground killing all 120 passengers. that is just one very small example of a well educated man killing hundreds for what real reason. I do believe in mental health and the need to verify if someone is mentally unstable but that's about it in gun control as we have laws in place to deal with our guns. The NRA has asked the ATF to look at these bump stocks regarding current laws on automatic weapons. Again, I'm not worried about it as if they are considered non compliant, it doesn't stop the right to bear arms. I shoot very well with a handgun semi or wheel and with rifle and shotgun. During LE training we fired automatic and its very uncontrollable, that's why the majority of time our own soldiers fire single round or if needed three round burst if needed. The full auto is a hail Mary shot, no pun intended as this is a very serious matter. The only political thing I want to say is at least we don't have a leader condemning our LEO's or our right to bear arms as we had been under attack of 8 years. I don't go to abortion clinics and bang the drum, even though I could. But I respect every ones rights regarding re-productivity and abortion rights. But as I respect your rights, respect those who believe in the 2nd and the 4th. many of our laws work together as they should. You screw with one, you screw with them all. When that happens America is gone for good without spilling blood. We fought one civil war, we learned our lesson then, we don't need a refresher.",0,0

The shooter in this video says they work really well and he even states in his video that they are actually more accurate than a fully automatic weapon if you know how to use it properly.

D6oaRAgdslE,Lol this fucking guy. Stupid choice by the shooter to use a bump stock implying that the smarter choice to kill more people was a single-fire weapon? You're a joke man,0,0
D6oaRAgdslE,"I mean, he is in an elevated position, firing down on 22,000 people...\\n\\nI think he used an M240 belt-fed machine gun though. Just my personal opinion. After hearing the sounds of gunfire at around the 5 minute mark in the synced up liveleak video I am confident most of the shooting was with an m240. I think he used an AR15 for about 20 seconds, suggesting some sort of insane extended round (or he rapidly switched to another AR-15 with another 30 round magazine) He wasn't going for accuracy...he just had to aim at the crowded venue.\\n\\nBut I do think, 100%, that he used an m240. the sounds of the shots at around the 5 minute mark...then look up an m240 being fired. It's a belt-fed gun. It's a MASSIVE machine gun. How anyone gets that into a hotel, that is beyond me.\\n\\nThere's more to all of this than we are being told.\\n\\nReal lives lost, real guns fired, but I don't think he had such a plethora of guns. It sounded like 3 different guns. Now, if you're going to do a mass shooting, and you bring 17 guns up to your hotel room, then all of them are going to be loaded. If you're planning something like this out, then all the guns will be loaded, hot, ready to go, so that you can switch to each one and, unfortunately, rain additional bullets on the crowd.\\n\\nBut that doesn't even add up to a total number of wounded people at the shooting. Assuming standard 30 round magazines, and according to the video, it sounded like he was firing off 50 rounds at a time, which I would assume, is belt-fed...\\n\\nHe would have only been able to wound 510 people assuming he had perfect accuracy. \\n\\nWatch the raw footage again please. It's enough to fool someone who isn't paying attention, but just...pay attention. Look up videos on an m240 being fired, and then watch the raw footage again.",0,0

I have shot from various guns in the past  (12 bore, 4.10 shotguns and a .22 rifle) but have not fired one for many years and until this arse-wipe went nuts in Vegas I'd never heard of bump stocks but it's clear from your film that they are a bit pointless if you want accuracy but great for an increased rate of fire, but that wasn't the point, the cowardly, demented murderer just wanted to fire off as many bullets as possible, causing maximum panic with as many casualties as he could and it would be hard not to miss when firing into a tightly packed crowd of human souls.\\nAs to why he did it, he'd probably lost a fair bit through his real estate investments, his gambling habits and his long term drug habits, coke, alcohol and various prescription meds were taking it's toll and he'd probably lost the plot, I guess we will never know but it would be interesting to see all the hotel CCTV footage shot on the corridor leading to his room just to see how many people were in his room on the day in question as well as a toxicology report from the autopsy.",0,0

Police and military would consider it basic suicide to confront a constituency that had firepower and....firepower maybe equivalent to theirs. Bumpstock is kinda an equalizer. I would like to think that my fellow Americans would never act on an unconstitutional order. But for the crazy, power mad elitists...nothing would be better than leaving us armed with bats, rocks, knives. It's just a history lesson left to be learned by some. When the bully knows you will hit back, the bully usually goes away. Bully would love to disarm you. That way, bullying is a fuckin cakewalk.

I am a BIG proponent of the 2nd amendment and actively support pro-gun organizations, but I can see where the general public has no need to own automatic weapons (machine guns) and these products really do nothing more than circumvent a law that has been in place for a long time (and one the gun lobby does not protest).

I agree it is useless for any competent AR or AK shooter.  However, I do think the device, in certain circumstances, such as LV, makes it a subject for us to at least have the conversation about the need to keep the device around.

D6oaRAgdslE,"Time to give bump fire stocks a Doug Score.\\n\\nStarting with the weekend category, styling is average.  It's not designed to be pretty, it's designed to work, but it gives the gun the look of being over bulky.  It earns a 4 out of 10.\\n\\nAcceleration is amazing, being able to ramp up a semi auto to almost full auto status through the use of kinetic energy is a concept so simple, I wouldn't have considered it myself.  It earns a 10 out of 10.\\n\\nHandling is poor though, with a reducing aiming ability, your only hope is to spray and pray.  This gives the stock a 2 out of 10.\\n\\nNext up is cool factor.  Any other time it would earn full points, and the imagination does indeed run wild with ideas of putting this on guns that had never had a full auto variant, such as the M1 Garand or M1 Carbine.  It would be callous to ignore the Las Vegas shooting however, and that alone drags the number down to a 6 out of 10.\\n\\nTime to talk about importance.  This number has gone the opposite way of cool factor and would have been low before.  These things were never popular, and were more of just a novelty, but because of their infamous role in the deadliest domestic terror attack, importance is now 9 out of 10.\\n\\nAdding that up we get a weekend score of 31 out of 50.  This ties it with the Tesla Model X which should tell you all you need to know about the Model X.\\n\\nThen we tackle the daily category, starting with features, this thing doesn't offer much, except for making your gun a select fire gun.  Not that I really expected more, it's just really simple in that regard.  It earns a 3 out of 10.\\n\\nComfort is also really low.  Gun recoil is always something to consider, and a rifle round puts out a considerable amount, even an intermediate cartridge like 5.56.  Resting this gun on any part of your body that's not your shoulder is gonna suck, giving us a 4 out of 10.\\n\\nNext is quality, and while your shot quality will suffer, the device in this video does appear to be built well and functions as it's made to, earning a generous 7 out of 10.\\n\\nPracticality is scored next, and let's face it.  Full auto is rarely practical on its own, but the method for firing this gun makes it worse.  It earns a 1 out of 10.\\n\\nLast is value.  Not sure how much this costs, but considering this gives you a budget machine gun without having to worry about tax stamps (for now) value isn't really that bad.  However, any real usefulness outside of mass shootings or zombie apocalypses is beyond me.  It earns a 3 out of 10.\\n\\nThe daily category comes out to be 18 out of 50.  Ouch.  Pretty bad.  That puts it in the lower 3rd of the chart and ties it with the Plymouth Prowler.\\n\\nCombine both totals and the final Doug Score is 49 out of 100.  This device is clever in what it does, but only solves a problem that no one had, and makes rapid fire too accessible to maniacs.  Seriously, don't waste your money.",0,0

Lupe Fiasco was out there grimy too. u just wouldnt know it cause they seem like squares to the people who dont know them.\\n\\nALso, I think he was showing love to NY just because he was there.

The ten affected states were individually named in the second part (South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, Arkansas, North Carolina). Not included were the Union slave states of Maryland, Delaware, Missouri and Kentucky. Also not named was the state of Tennessee, in which a Union-controlled military government had already been set up, based in the capital, Nashville. Specific exemptions were stated for areas also under Union control on January 1, 1863, namely 48 counties that would soon become West Virginia, seven other named counties of Virginia including Berkeley and Hampshire counties, which were soon added to West Virginia, New Orleans and 13 named parishes nearby. The Emancipation Proclamation was only for counties controlled by the Confederacy, slave counties and slave states controlled by the Union DID NOT free their slaves with the Emancipation Proclamation.",1,0

Draw up a literal checklist, that lists every standard part of a song, and at all the stages in each part's production, plus all the non-descript other parts, and all the steps of mixing and mastering. Then at the top add a Project Filename line at the top with some other details (genre, expected BPM, working title, alias/produced as), and then PRINT OUT A STACK OF THEM, MAKE A NOTEBOOK FULL OF THIS SHEET!!!\\n\\nThen when you start a new project, you have a literal, physical tracker to keep track of what you still have to do, so you don't forget, and you can track multiple projects. Then when you're done, you can take that filled up checklist, and put it in a folder somewhere. Hell you could make folders that are for albums and have checklists for a goal of how many tracks and if you have album art and such ready.... This....

Syncing with the music, stage presence, along with all the technical manipulations. Most players design their routine to score high within the rules of the competition. Due to how the rules are designed, you may not see the most visually impressive or creative manipulations. It's all about creating  something that scores high and is still exciting to watch. Freestyles are a single instance where a player performs something they may have practiced dozens of times. If Evan planned every single move, I bet he had almost perfect execution of his routine during a practice session at some point. The ability to execute a completely clean routine  during a competition is rare. All that matters is that he was having a blast sharing his passion and showing us something amazing!",3,2

6u9LNN9HwC4,"Big predictions that are not new, first order will get a big victory in this part of the series (not necessarily enough to end it though) Rey will join the dark side, if only to get an idea of her purpose, also it's the best way to get close to snoke and I would imagine this is how they will choose to end it with Rey going off with Kylo to meet snoke. This will leave Luke once again as the last Jedi for now. This will also help Rey get her double bladed lightsaber as so far its been more of a sith weapon, yet will not be surprised if Rey and maybe even kylo (who will die) fight snoke. I just hope the battle of Crait will be all in one movie and not part of the cliff hanger for the new episode. Additionally maybe with Rey joining snoke maybe Luke will look to train Finn, if not force sensitive he can still wield a lightsaber and with Luke being one of the best (not just because he is alive lol) duellists he will still be formidable. I prefer this idea rather than Luke saying to some extent Screw this, you overpowered kids go blow up the universe, I'm gonna be all seclusive on my rock meditating and stuff, you all have fun... since that's an odd way to send mark Hamil away and Luke who should die fighting like quigon did.",0,0

6u9LNN9HwC4,"My theory ... which may be shared by others ... is that the LAST Jedi is the last because of the prophesy that everyone thought was about Anakin Skywalker bringing BALANCE to the force.  Remember the knights of Ren are NOT Sith.  So... no Sith on the dark side, and no Jedi on the light side, maybe Luky, Kylo and Rey will find BALANCE.  IF you watch SW Rebels, there is a very large creature called The Bendu that even claims to BE balance in the force.... and Rebels is CANON..... so I think that even if Luke and/or Leia are killed, BEN SOLO (not Kylo Ren) and Rey will work to balance the Force\\n\\nBut hey... there is another entire movie to go so what do I know",0,0

Therefore, Disney can do whatever they want in the films, scrapping all the silly side stories and cartoons describing him a Munn. 2) Just because Grand Moff Tarkin never showed off a force ability does not mean he did not possess force abilities....For all we know, Darth Vader acted like a watch dog for Grand Moff Tarkin because Grand Moff Tarkin was actually the darkside master of his own master, Darth Sideous. Disney could take this story in so many directions. It is extremely important to remember that Disney will want to throw us off the scent trail.

0TMHdsFYDOo,There is not one person with power in Hollywood that didn't know the score just like we ALL knew the score. The casting couch joke is 6 decades old. Nobody said a word until it became financially viable to do so and they would not be hurt by saying it. These hypocrites are now farming virtue by jumping into the spotlight now that it is safe to do so. My question now is will even one person on the virtue bandwagon speak up about what is going on with the CHILD actors. We ALL know what is going on there too. My prediction is no. The pedophiles in Hollywood are not outed and still in control of who works and who does not and no celebrity will take them on for the same reason they only spoke up about this now that it is safe to do so.,1,0

I also blame NBC as well for covering up this story or shall we say trying to kill it. Weinstein was a sexual predator they let get away with this for many years! I understand sometimes victims of sexual assault often are afraid of their abusers, but not everyone who knew about this was assaulted! So they failed to speak up against the real sexual predator but openly and aggressively spoke out against Trump who they simply assumed was a sexual predator with no real evidence.

I am certainly confused when she is or was at the fore front of the push against men and their status and dominance over women is now asking men to protect WOMEN? Was not the Movement all about we do not need men to look after us? We do not men to protect us? But Now she wants men to protect women? I thought women need to be strong for themselves, to help others, if she knew about it she was doing nothing but help the abuse. A strong woman, a feminist would have stood up and stopped the abuse of, as she said, young people. Seems a bit moronic that some one who was at the roots of the fight against the oppression of women by men did NOTHING to try and stop it. But hey that is just my thoughts is all.",1,1
0TMHdsFYDOo,men have to defend you? So chivalry again? Interesting.,1,1
0TMHdsFYDOo,"This is not a male only issue, as horrible as it is for any man to take advantage of a women there are women who use their sexuality to get ahead. If you want to change male behavior the coin should be flipped to see the other side. Many women seek out partnerships, romances and such from powerful rich men utilizing their attributes to get what they want. When you read some of the sexual harassment case facts quite often the inappropriate behavior begins with a flirty female looking to advance in a given field, it leads to flirty conversations and sometimes a physical relationship. The complaints and legal issues are not made until a raise or promotion is not granted and the allegation is always he made me do this. There are exceptions but it generally takes 2 to Tango!!",0,1

I'm not only talking about Justice League and the original Avengers film but also films like Seven Samurai, Inception, Ocean's Eleven, the Dirty Dozen, the Usual Suspects and even Armageddon. This is a tired and true concept as it can work across all genres but it seems very hard to succeed at because not only do you need to have your team work towards a goal but each member of your team needs to have their own moments and unique personalities. What are some tropes you see in this particular format as well?",0,0

HUgYoT_xEFY,Thank you for your content!,0,0
HUgYoT_xEFY,Great video. You left out a key part of Logan's normal world that shapes the lie he believes. Logan' has lived many many years. Bad things happen to people he cares about because he has lived so long and through so much. He always outlives the people he cares about both because he is virtually indestructible and because of the longevity of his life. His mutant gift is his curse and shapes the way he has viewed the world for a long time. That curse gives depth to his pain beyond the simple statement that bad things happen to those he cares about.,0,0

HUgYoT_xEFY,"I'm not a student of film, but I couldn't watch Logan - it was one of the few films I switched off before it finished. All the emotion seemed so tacky and cliche - please, Logan; do it for the children... And all the swearing and blood just seemed like cheap, desperate attempts to regain an audience that's moved on. The bad guys were unrealistically evil, and not surprisingly arranged into a heartless, tattooed, child-killing muscled paramilitary posse - the perfect characters to have die - and headed by a suave young bad ass leader - there wasn't one thing this movie did which hadn't been done a million times before, including in Children of Men.  \\nOver-emotional, unimaginative, and falling over itself to be gritty, it just didn't do it for me at all.\\n\\nSo yeah, I didn't like it, and don't think it came anywhere near CoM.",0,0

The first pregnant woman in 18 years is the circumstances of the world changing, before her what he believed was true. \\n\\n2.) Logan the movie never proved that the lie Logan the character believed to be false. At the end of the movie, two of the 3 people in his life die, and one is on the run from people who are hunting her. Even the nice family he stayed with on the farm all die. Shitty stuff happened to the people he let into his life. If anything, the movie proves him right. \\n\\n3.) Reading books about how to write stories and character arcs seem to me like all it will do is produce very formulaic writers.",0,2

6u9LNN9HwC4,"My theory ... which may be shared by others ... is that the LAST Jedi is the last because of the prophesy that everyone thought was about Anakin Skywalker bringing BALANCE to the force.  Remember the knights of Ren are NOT Sith.  So... no Sith on the dark side, and no Jedi on the light side, maybe Luky, Kylo and Rey will find BALANCE.  IF you watch SW Rebels, there is a very large creature called The Bendu that even claims to BE balance in the force.... and Rebels is CANON..... so I think that even if Luke and/or Leia are killed, BEN SOLO (not Kylo Ren) and Rey will work to balance the Force\\n\\nBut hey... there is another entire movie to go so what do I know",0,0

I moved myself, my 18 mo old and 4 yr old to the rural Midwest so I could help take care of my aging parent's. Being their only daughter to care of them, I had no choice but to move. Unfortunately years of propositions from a male superior telling me how I could earn a raise. I rejected every advance and had to forego the pay increases because I was better than what that pervert wanted. I ended up losing my heart, soul, dignity, self esteem and feels like my mind some days.  The last year was beyond comprehension after the extreme advances/touching/etc (too explicit to explain as it was almost rape). Having 3 Master's Degrees I had to settle for the only 1 job that would hire me based on being over educated in rural America. I couldn't get the guts to speak up because if I lost my job I was afraid of how I could support my children. I REGRET not being stronger to do something during the early stages. It wasn't until my Director did his typical try of p.ssy grabbing 'in front of 20+ male co-workers' at a Company Christmas party. The men who saw did nothing! Not until they saw me tryung to punch him and push him away. As usual he thought he was hidden or wouldn't be caught like usual by the elevator door closing. I wasn't the one who turned in him so I was in violation of the Company Ethics Policy! Yes he was fired but later so was I due to that policy. This was his 6th charge on record with the same company yet never could be proven as fact by past other women who took their allegations to Corporate.  Women please know that a Company will find every way to retaliate against you. These multi million companies can't be fought, lawyers are not willing to take your case unless you are paid huge salaries. Large companies have too many lawyers on staff for most attorney's to want to deal with us. I tried calling the EEOC but couldn't reach a live person after 7 hours on hold a couple times. By the time I did reach someone after multiple calls - I learned I exceeded the 120 day rule to even get the right to sue or have any rights. Suing was NOT what I wanted to do, I only wanted to find out if I had legal rights to keep my job! I can't believe how messed up the whole system and process is. How somebody can get by with doing this over and over again? We need bigger voices like Hollywood to help us get change and awareness. I have been writing a detailed book of the events.  It is exactly as explicit as the events that factually happened. If only I could get people to read it and understand what happens to the victims during and after. So others can help as it's seems to be a common part of society and keeping employment. Most importantly what it does to a once strong, smart, educated woman like myself for years following. Life becomes your own living hell yet you have to go on to try to be a mother to those young kids. Now 6 years later and are older, they think I'm just a Feminist. I can't tell them why I cry suddenly several times a day. Hiding in my bathroom for hours at a time. It is no way to live. Know the interrogation you are subjected to for months during the Companies investigational stage can be worse also even more humiliating.  Many male co-workers who witnessed the event did very awful things to try to get me to quit. Many received huge pay advances or undeserved promotions with much higher pay. No one was ever allowed to speak to me. The others who didn't get the huge pay increases would say things like don't talk to her because she'll sue you for sexual harassment, someone put their feces in my desk, print outs mocking me would be put up for minutes then quickly removed and much more disgusting things.  I was moved away from sharing office space with any male employees while the Company prolonged the instigation to 121 days after the last incident. Yep - exactly 1 day after you have legal rights under the EEOC. How would I have known my fate? I was NEVER the one who provoked, encouraged, flirted with, never wore clothing that was provocative plus I continually said NO asking him to stop! He told no-one would believe me all that time! I was afraid of losing the only job in such a Podunk area. He threw it in my face when I threatened to turn him in if he didn't stop. He knew from his own past experience he could get away with that irrational behavior. Keep in mind I never sued anyone nor did I never received a dime. I never once asked for money... all I did was ask to keep my job! \\nThere has to be something done to protect our careers. Or even something available to support each other who have to live their life after with such anger, hatred, feelings of someone else violating us, asking ourselves why, how, if only or the what ifs, etc.. You never feel safe or even the same again!",0,0

I've read YA books specifically about asperger's and specifically about anxiety, and though somethings were relatable (at best) they never struck me as real, and often quite stereotypical. I've never had any of the specific problems that Aza, or John Green, suffers from. A lot of the paragraphs were hard to wrap me head around, thoughts and experiences that had never occured to me was how OCD was like. But, and most importantly, at the same time I strongly related to a lot of the feelings and thoughts Aza had. It really blew me away how a person suffering from so vastly different things than me still experinced literal feeling and literal thoughts that I myself struggle with.

It's good, but it makes Obessessive Intrusive thoughts seem way less inescapable as they are. And it doesn't grasp the severity, only somewhat the conplexity. You want a good Ovsessive Intrusive/Obsessive Harmful book, read The Rest of Us Just Live Here by Patrick Ness. It is good though.",0,0

His mutant gift is his curse and shapes the way he has viewed the world for a long time. That curse gives depth to his pain beyond the simple statement that bad things happen to those he cares about.,0,0

CNwYcyRAl1Y,I've always hated remixes and mashups after his death but.... This one I have to admit I like A LOT .... The dangerous part at the beggining and Blood on the Dance Floor are a little bit slower than the originals but they fit really well as well as the ending  where he starts to freestyle ... It's just amazing,1,1

GLbJCklVVJU,"I love that every routine Evan does is better than the last one. He's always entertaining, but somehow becomes more entertaining every time. Well deserved win.",4,0
GLbJCklVVJU,"FOR ALL THOSE HATERS OUT THERE:\\nEvan is an extremely competent player who works hard just to try and impress the crowd and score high. If you think doing tricks with a couple tangled strings is boring, then you should click out of the video. This is for people who truly understand the effort and skill has been put into this performance along with the synchronisation.\\nIf you disliked the video because you wanted Gentry to win, go and see his reaction to Evan winning 1st. He was proud as heck, so if you stan Gentry so much, appreciate Evan like he does.",7,2

GLbJCklVVJU,"Yes! Bringing the trophy back to the 808!\\n\\nFor all the non-yoyo viewers, keep in mind that freestyles are all about the performance. Syncing with the music, stage presence, along with all the technical manipulations. Most players design their routine to score high within the rules of the competition. Due to how the rules are designed, you may not see the most visually impressive or creative manipulations. It's all about creating  something that scores high and is still exciting to watch. Freestyles are a single instance where a player performs something they may have practiced dozens of times. If Evan planned every single move, I bet he had almost perfect execution of his routine during a practice session at some point. The ability to execute a completely clean routine  during a competition is rare. All that matters is that he was having a blast sharing his passion and showing us something amazing!",4,2

6u9LNN9HwC4,"My theory ... which may be shared by others ... is that the LAST Jedi is the last because of the prophesy that everyone thought was about Anakin Skywalker bringing BALANCE to the force.  Remember the knights of Ren are NOT Sith.  So... no Sith on the dark side, and no Jedi on the light side, maybe Luky, Kylo and Rey will find BALANCE.  IF you watch SW Rebels, there is a very large creature called The Bendu that even claims to BE balance in the force.... and Rebels is CANON..... so I think that even if Luke and/or Leia are killed, BEN SOLO (not Kylo Ren) and Rey will work to balance the Force\\n\\nBut hey... there is another entire movie to go so what do I know",0,0

0TMHdsFYDOo,"SATAN HOLDS MOST PEOPLE CAPTIVE IN THE SPIRITUAL KINGDOM OF DARKNESS \\nI Peter 5:8 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the Devil as a roaring lion prowls about seeking whom he may devour. Satan is the liar, deceiver, tempter, destroyer, robber, and killer of men's souls. He is the negative part of the test we are all taking with the free will God gave each of us. Most people are not passing the test. They are sinners living in the spiritual Kingdom of darkness where Satan rules and holds most people captive playing with them like puppets on a string. It is irrelevant whether or not you believe in him. Jeremiah 17:9 The heart is deceitful above all things and beyond cure. Who can understand it? The only escape anyone has from the power of Satan and the power of sin is to surrender our lives to Jesus Christ.\\n \\nLIGHT OR DARKNESS, WHERE DO YOU LIVE ? Many people live in darkness. separated or \\ndisconnected from their Heavenly Father by their sins causing them to be at war with Him. \\nMan is a sinner filled with much of the same character defects which got Satan and a third \\nof the angels thrown out of Heaven. They are here on planet earth continuing their \\ndisobedience and rebellion til Jesus returns.\\n \\nThere are two spiritual kingdoms around us at this moment in time. There is the spiritual \\nkingdom of light where Christ rules and the spiritual kingdom of darkness where Satan rules. \\nAll of us exist in one of these Kingdoms. Matt. 7: 13-14, The pathway to Heaven is narrow \\nand few find it but the pathway to Hell is a broad road where many dwell and travel. In simple terms, few dwell in the Kingdom of Light but many in the kingdom of darkness. Satan and the fallen angels have been given a certain amount of freedom and access to us as they are the negative part of the test we are all here taking with the  free will  God gave us.\\n \\nBoth Christ and Satan have superior power to any human being. Satan is a liar, deceiver, \\ntempter, robber, destroyer, and killer of men's souls. He is the god of this world, and is \\ncapable of blinding people so they cannot see Jesus Christ. II Cor 4: 3-5. Since so many \\npeople live in that Spiritual Kingdom of Darkness they only have access to the knowledge \\nand understanding that this Kingdom provides. They may consider the substance and \\ntheology of the Kingdom of light to be foolishness.\\nI Corinthians 2:14  Now the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for \\nthey are foolishness unto him; and he cannot know them, because they are spiritually \\njudged. And how are they going to visualize or comprehend the Holy Spirit who indwells \\nevery genuine believer and follower of Jesus and His teachings. Acts 5:32, We are \\nwitnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who \\nobey him.‚Äù Jesus said, John 14: 15 ‚ÄúIf you love me, keep my commands. 16 And I will \\nask the Father, and he will give you another advocate to help you and be with you forever\\n‚Äî 17 the Spirit of truth. ( Holy Spirit ) The world cannot accept him, because it neither \\nsees him nor knows him. But you know him, for he lives with you and will be in you. Most \\npeople live separated from God / Jesus by their sins causing a void or emptiness in their \\nlife. They live disconnected. I John 5:12 Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not \\nhave the Son of God does not have life.\\n \\nDear friends, Your sins and mine put Jesus, who had no sin and was that innocent lamb \\nslaughtered, so that you and I may have opportunity for forgiveness of our sins and hope \\nof eternal life with our Heavenly Father. The only escape any of us have from the power \\nof Satan and the power of sin is to surrender our life to Jesus Christ. \\n \\nOn the day of Pentecost in Acts 2 there were 3,000 people wanting to know what to do \\nto be saved. Peter told them to repent, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for \\nthe remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. 3,000 did this, \\n( immersed in water ), and Jesus added them to His Church, which is God's Kingdom \\nhere on earth also known as the Kingdom of light. Colossians 1:10-14. \\n \\nAny humble penitent heart can get God / Jesus's attention to be saved. Please consider \\nthis. Thank you for listening",0,0

Since I am character centraled writer, I'm looking back on my product and seeing the glaring flaws in my book AND the potentialfor it to be better. \\n\\nThanks to this video, now I have a better idea of how to handle my protagonist's character arc. The fact that the lie she believes in is too easily debunked early in the book, and now I am seeking ways to get that lie to hold her back even further than before so I can make a more compelling narrative.\\n\\nTHANK YOU, Michaeal, for everything you do on this channel.

fLLe5sODKtg,"Half way through the book myself, and you said You don't want to read it and I'm almost at that point. Because it's just making me emotional to read what's happening to Aza. For sure going to finish it tomorrow since I have the day off and can do a few chapters at a time.",0,0
fLLe5sODKtg,"I absolutely adored this book. I feel like the writing was totally different from John Green's other novels, and not what I expected, but still amazing. I've struggled with OCD for years, and at times, I felt like I was reading about my own life. Aza's issues and thought processes felt so similar to my own it made me feel so understood. I‚Äôve found it difficult to find an accurate representation of OCD in literature, but probably due to his own struggles, I think John Green nailed it on the head. I haven‚Äôt felt this excited about YA in months! As you said, it‚Äôs truly a gem.",0,0
fLLe5sODKtg,I started and finished the book today and I also loved it so much. I didn‚Äôt know it was Own Voices and now I love it so much more. I was very nervous to pick this book up- because I loved his other books when I read them but I was much younger. And now I can see many issues with those books that I didn‚Äôt then. I was afraid this would be more of the same. And it wasn‚Äôt. It was so good. \n\nCongrats on the mention! I‚Äôm so happy you could be a part of making this book as good as it is.,0,0

fLLe5sODKtg,"I did like the book overall but I wasn't a fan of how every character seemed to have an innate knowledge of classic literature and could just quote poetry off the top of their head. Aza and Davis seemed to have a deep philosophical understanding of life which I feel like teenagers wouldn't have. Like, John Greens own thoughts  and opinions really showed through his characters which kind of ruined the realism for me.",0,0

However, it does have a really cool aspect where the main character has equations for a lot of things going on in the book (that were drawn up by an actual mathematician!).

fLLe5sODKtg,"I really enjoyed watching this review even though I still haven't read the book yet. I'm really looking forward to reading Turtles all the way after watching this review. However I just wanted to point out that when one talks about mental illness, one should avoid using the verb suffering. I don't think it's appropriate. It would be better if one says someone has OCD rather than someone suffers from OCD or worse someone is OCD (or someone is schizophrenic, for example). Besides that, I think this was a brilliant video as always!",0,0

fLLe5sODKtg,"As a person who doesn't suffer from OCD, but do have other mental health problems (Aspergers and anxiety), I was really blowned away about how real and authentic it was written. I've read YA books specifically about asperger's and specifically about anxiety, and though somethings were relatable (at best) they never struck me as real, and often quite stereotypical. I've never had any of the specific problems that Aza, or John Green, suffers from. A lot of the paragraphs were hard to wrap me head around, thoughts and experiences that had never occured to me was how OCD was like. But, and most importantly, at the same time I strongly related to a lot of the feelings and thoughts Aza had. It really blew me away how a person suffering from so vastly different things than me still experinced literal feeling and literal thoughts that I myself struggle with. Also note how I called Aza a person: The story maybe fictional, but the struggle with mental health is the most accurate I've ever read.",0,0

Syncing with the music, stage presence, along with all the technical manipulations. Most players design their routine to score high within the rules of the competition. Due to how the rules are designed, you may not see the most visually impressive or creative manipulations. It's all about creating  something that scores high and is still exciting to watch. Freestyles are a single instance where a player performs something they may have practiced dozens of times. If Evan planned every single move, I bet he had almost perfect execution of his routine during a practice session at some point. The ability to execute a completely clean routine  during a competition is rare. All that matters is that he was having a blast sharing his passion and showing us something amazing!",4,2

IF you watch SW Rebels, there is a very large creature called The Bendu that even claims to BE balance in the force.... and Rebels is CANON..... so I think that even if Luke and/or Leia are killed, BEN SOLO (not Kylo Ren) and Rey will work to balance the Force\\n\\nBut hey... there is another entire movie to go so what do I know",0,0

PeUgWK0pUIA,"Games are not turning into movies.\\n\\nThis is feeling condescending towards games and gamers, a common thread I seem to see in Cracked.com's video game related medium. Video games are not going towards movies. Video games are developing graphics in order to better their own medium. The graphics help facilitate the game experience and it is NOT the focus. Any intelligent game developer knows that graphics do not make a game. It can only add to it.\\n\\nvideogamedunkey made an excellent video against high fidelity graphics and he even had a piece where he showed dislike for Horizon Zero Dawn for trying to push graphics, but failing to put life into cutscenes. As said before, the graphics were pretty ... but it cannot hide core blemishes that are underneath the graphics.",0,0

She even visited North Vietnam to boost our enemy's morale. She was filmed  climbing on an antiaircraft gun proudly saluting her comrades with the straight arm fist. Back then if Weinstein made a move on her he would be spitting out teeth. She was well protected because her father was one of the most powerful people in the industry.\\n\\nWhy this blatant traitor wasn't arrested at the airport when she returned is beyond me. She was guilty of giving aid and comfort to the enemy, a federal felony and punishable by death. She was one of the most beautiful and sexy women in Hollywood, but she was so militant showing so much contempt for our troops in Vietnam, even her beauty couldn't divert attention away from her treason.\\n\\nWhen she made her comeback, she was so remorseful and apologized for her misguided loyalty. As expected, it didn't take long for her to return to the radical communist. In another video she says she's ashamed to be an American, when wasn't she ashamed, probably before kindergarten.\\n\\nThomas",0,0

fLLe5sODKtg,"I absolutely adored this book. I feel like the writing was totally different from John Green's other novels, and not what I expected, but still amazing.

I‚Äôve found it difficult to find an accurate representation of OCD in literature, but probably due to his own struggles, I think John Green nailed it on the head. I haven‚Äôt felt this excited about YA in months! As you said, it‚Äôs truly a gem.",0,0

However, it does have a really cool aspect where the main character has equations for a lot of things going on in the book (that were drawn up by an actual mathematician!).

However I just wanted to point out that when one talks about mental illness, one should avoid using the verb suffering. I don't think it's appropriate. It would be better if one says someone has OCD rather than someone suffers from OCD or worse someone is OCD (or someone is schizophrenic, for example).

fLLe5sODKtg,"As a person who doesn't suffer from OCD, but do have other mental health problems (Aspergers and anxiety), I was really blowned away about how real and authentic it was written. I've read YA books specifically about asperger's and specifically about anxiety, and though somethings were relatable (at best) they never struck me as real, and often quite stereotypical. I've never had any of the specific problems that Aza, or John Green, suffers from. A lot of the paragraphs were hard to wrap me head around, thoughts and experiences that had never occured to me was how OCD was like. But, and most importantly, at the same time I strongly related to a lot of the feelings and thoughts Aza had. It really blew me away how a person suffering from so vastly different things than me still experinced literal feeling and literal thoughts that I myself struggle with. Also note how I called Aza a person: The story maybe fictional, but the struggle with mental health is the most accurate I've ever read.",0,0

I've not read any of John Green's books before ,but I really want to, but Im not sure which one to start,you definitely convinced me to read Turtles All The Way Down . I'm not a constant reader, but I guess I have to make time to read this one especially when I'm dealing with a lot of teenage problems currently.

Last night it was super late, but I couldn't put it down because I was balling and I didn't want to go to sleep upset. It is just written soooooo well that you feel everything Aza feels and it was so hard to read, but that's what makes this book so important.

So you would wait inside the bathrooms untill everyone got out side the school and into the playground. Then we are pretty much free inside a school. The next part is when it's exactly 1:58 we would go down the stairs sneek into the bushes near the place we're they would run and go to our group tents. That was the plan.

Movies right now tell much better stories that deserve all the recognition it gets. Games at best emulate B-level exploitation movies, schlock and meaningless gibberish not meant to be taken too seriously. A potential exception would be visual novels but with their limited popularity, it's hardly going to produce something magnificent.\\n\\nFurthermore, and most importantly, games should be about gameplay. Updating graphics might be an objective these days but it should never replace gameplay. A game that is shallow at its core even with the best graphics and story gets forgotten easily, sometimes within a month until VGAs roll around.",0,0

PeUgWK0pUIA,"I think it's the story that matters rather than the graphics. Graphics are important for attracting an audience because better graphics equals better game in a lot of people's minds. But games with very good graphics and voice-acting can bomb. Though graphics and voice-acting are important, without a good story to captivate an audience, its chances of success drop. That is to say, that if done right, it doesn't matter if the games or movies have the best quality graphics/effects. Ex. Undertale for video games and Jurassic Park vs. Jurassic World for movies. Ultimately, it's the execution of the story and journey the player is taken on that will determine the majority of a game's critical success.",0,0

fLLe5sODKtg,"Great video, can't wait to read the book now! :) \\nHave you seen the Norwegian tv series SKAM (=shame)? It's really good and it's been a boom in Scandinavia. I was first reluctant to seeing it because it is a teen series, but it's SO GOOD. It's beautifully filmed, I love the editing, it's so thrilling and you crave the next episode immediately, the characters are interesting and it's a real depiction of young adults. The writers spent a lot of time on research by interviewing young adults and following their lives for a while, and so they have incorporated technology use and social media in a true way that teens use it, it's very well incorporated! \\nThere are four seasons and each season is through the eyes of one person. One episode follows them from Sunday to Saturday. What's cool about that is that when the series aired in real time, the episodes and weekdays also aired in real time. For example, let's say the Wednesday part played out at 18:03 pm, then it was released exactly that time on their website. Then on the Sunday the weekdays were released combined as one episode. And they had bonus material on the website of prints from the character's message chats and instagram uploads that weren't included in the episode, so you would get a broader picture. \\nLast thing: the fourth season is centered around a Muslim girl called Sana. I have never before seen a Muslim girl, especially one wearing a hijab, be front and center and have her story be told. That's very cool. \\nCan't stop talking about SKAM. It's probably available somewhere with English subtitles, for those who haven't seen it, give it a go! :)",0,0

fLLe5sODKtg,"Same here, I got tired with YA for a little while because a lot of them I feel like romanticizes mental illness or some of them had plot that's been used over and over but if you're looking something different I recommend reading How It Went Down by Kekla Magoon and All American Boys by Jason Reynolds and Brendan Kiely, those two books are powerful and reminded me why I love reading YA. Also wasn't sure about reading John Green's new book but your video got me excited, and love your videos. Have a great day :)",0,0

fLLe5sODKtg,Hi Ariel - I love your videos! I can't help but download a book to my kindle straight after watching your videos. Have you read Panther by David Owen? I actually used to work with Dave and I was completely surprised when he suddenly came into work with a printed book. I read it and loved it!

fLLe5sODKtg,"Half way through the book myself, and you said You don't want to read it and I'm almost at that point. Because it's just making me emotional to read what's happening to Aza. For sure going to finish it tomorrow since I have the day off and can do a few chapters at a time.",0,0
fLLe5sODKtg,"I absolutely adored this book. I feel like the writing was totally different from John Green's other novels, and not what I expected, but still amazing. I've struggled with OCD for years, and at times, I felt like I was reading about my own life. Aza's issues and thought processes felt so similar to my own it made me feel so understood. I‚Äôve found it difficult to find an accurate representation of OCD in literature, but probably due to his own struggles, I think John Green nailed it on the head. I haven‚Äôt felt this excited about YA in months! As you said, it‚Äôs truly a gem.",0,0
fLLe5sODKtg,I started and finished the book today and I also loved it so much. I didn‚Äôt know it was Own Voices and now I love it so much more. I was very nervous to pick this book up- because I loved his other books when I read them but I was much younger. And now I can see many issues with those books that I didn‚Äôt then. I was afraid this would be more of the same. And it wasn‚Äôt. It was so good. \n\nCongrats on the mention! I‚Äôm so happy you could be a part of making this book as good as it is.,0,0

fLLe5sODKtg,"I did like the book overall but I wasn't a fan of how every character seemed to have an innate knowledge of classic literature and could just quote poetry off the top of their head. Aza and Davis seemed to have a deep philosophical understanding of life which I feel like teenagers wouldn't have. Like, John Greens own thoughts  and opinions really showed through his characters which kind of ruined the realism for me.",0,0

I'm stoked to hear that the technology aspect is realistic - I find that one of the biggest annoyances in YA books (ESPECIALLY WHEN THE BOOK IS CENTRED AROUND ONLINE CULTURE AND IT'S WRONG...)\\n\\nTo be honest, An Abundance of Katherine's is my least favourite of the John Green books. However, it does have a really cool aspect where the main character has equations for a lot of things going on in the book (that were drawn up by an actual mathematician!). So it's not something to rush to, but if you've got the chance or you're feeling like a quick read it's not bad!",0,0

fLLe5sODKtg,"I didn't even think about it while I was reading it, but you're right--the technology use in this book is very realistic.

Not to mention the fact that none of the 5 main charachters are straight and white. Please read it, i love it and i think more ppl should read it.",0,0

fLLe5sODKtg,"I really enjoyed watching this review even though I still haven't read the book yet. I'm really looking forward to reading Turtles all the way after watching this review. However I just wanted to point out that when one talks about mental illness, one should avoid using the verb suffering. I don't think it's appropriate. It would be better if one says someone has OCD rather than someone suffers from OCD or worse someone is OCD (or someone is schizophrenic, for example). Besides that, I think this was a brilliant video as always!",0,0

fLLe5sODKtg,"As a person who doesn't suffer from OCD, but do have other mental health problems (Aspergers and anxiety), I was really blowned away about how real and authentic it was written. I've read YA books specifically about asperger's and specifically about anxiety, and though somethings were relatable (at best) they never struck me as real, and often quite stereotypical. I've never had any of the specific problems that Aza, or John Green, suffers from. A lot of the paragraphs were hard to wrap me head around, thoughts and experiences that had never occured to me was how OCD was like. But, and most importantly, at the same time I strongly related to a lot of the feelings and thoughts Aza had. It really blew me away how a person suffering from so vastly different things than me still experinced literal feeling and literal thoughts that I myself struggle with. Also note how I called Aza a person: The story maybe fictional, but the struggle with mental health is the most accurate I've ever read.",0,0

HUgYoT_xEFY,"Hey! that was a pretty analysis. But I do have a small disagreement: Logan's lie. At the beginning of the video I thought it might be a bigger disagreement, but you do address part of it when you talk about the initial attitudes both protagonists have about the future. The thing is: I'm not sure Logan's lie is some aversion towards family in general.... I mean he does go to great lengths in order to take care of Xavier in his very complicated decrepitude. I'd probably say that Logan's lie has to do with where he thinks his family exists and what he should be trying to save. His lie is that his family ties can only exist in the past and that the debt he needs to repay to professor X can be repaid by taking care of him. But the truth is that his debt must be payed forward, that his obligations are towards the future, not the past.",0,0

We follow and obey our Righteous King in our actions and deeds and the world hates us for it, because we don't form ourselves and obey the fallen king of this present world which is Satan):\\n\\n(Jesus):\\n\\nIf the world hates you,\\n\\nye know that\\nit hated me\\nbefore it hated you.\\n\\n(John 15:18).\\n\\n***(Hated Me): The world hated Him, so it should not be surprising that the world hates His followers.\\n\\n***(James 4:4)<---Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.\\n\\n***(1 John 2:15)<---Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\\n\\n***(Luke 6:26)<---Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Build your house with Jesus, on the rock, and you will never sink, that's (IF) we continue to Keep his Commandments, we will bear MUCH FRUIT!):\\n\\n(Jesus):\\n\\nAbide in me,\\nand I in you.\\n\\nAs the branch\\ncannot bear fruit of itself,\\nexcept it abide in the vine;\\n\\nno more can ye,\\nexcept ye abide in me.\\n\\n(John 15:4).\\n\\n***For the branch to produce more fruit, it must abide, which means to dwell, to stay, to settle in, to sink deeper. The way to abide in Christ is to OBEY.\\n\\n***(John 15:10)<---If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.\\n\\n***(1 John 3:24)<---And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.\\n\\n***The believer who lovingly OBEYS the Word of God produces much fruit.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Christ answers Philip, on himself and the Father as One. God manifested in the FLESH!):\\n\\nPhilip saith unto him, Lord,\\n\\nshew us the Father, \\nand it sufficeth us.\\n\\nJesus saith unto him,\\n\\nHave I been so long time with you, \\nand yet hast thou not known me, \\nPhilip?\\n\\nhe that hath seen me \\nhath seen the Father;\\n\\nand how sayest thou then, \\nShew us the Father?\\n\\nBelievest thou not that\\n\\nI am in the Father, \\nand the Father in me?\\n\\nthe words that I speak unto you \\nI speak not of myself:\\nbut (the Father)\\nthat (dwelleth) (in me),\\nhe doeth the works.\\n\\n(John 14:8-10).\\n\\n***(Revelation 21:3)<---And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the (tabernacle of God) is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and (God himself) shall be with them, and (be their God).\\n\\n***(Revelation 1:8)<---(Jesus)<----I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, (((the Almighty))).\\n\\n***The Lord rebuked Philip because he should have known the answer to the question he asked.\\n\\n***(He who has seen Me has seen the Father): The Lord patiently explained again that He was revealing God the Father to them in verse 7. It is impossible to escape the claim Jesus was making. Clearly, He was claiming to be God!\\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\\n\\nJesus said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\\n\\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\\nbut Jesus hid himself, \\nand went out of the temple,\\n\\ngoing through the midst of them, \\nand so passed by.\\n\\n(John 8:58-59).\\n\\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\\n\\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\\n\\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(I AM):\\n\\n(Gk. ego emimi);\\n\\n*(John 6:35)<---And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst).\\n*(John 10:7)<---Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep).\\n*(John 10:14)<---I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine).\\n*(John 15:1)<---I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman).\\n*(John 18:5)<---They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\\n\\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\\n\\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\\n\\nThen answered Jesus \\nand said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \\n\\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\\nfor what things soever he doeth, \\n\\nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\\n\\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\\n\\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \\nand sheweth him all things \\nthat himself doeth:\\n\\nand he will shew him \\ngreater works than these, \\nthat ye may marvel.\\n\\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\\n\\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \\nand quickeneth them; \\neven so the Son quickeneth \\nwhom he will.\\n\\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\\n(John 5:19-21).",0,0

PeUgWK0pUIA,"I realize the people behind Cracked are casual gamers, if that, but even a cursory glance at Steam and some of the recent releases can defy that theory they put here. For several years now, Steam has become saturated with Retro-style games - mostly games using 2D graphics that look similar to the ones we've had back in the 80s and early 90s. \\nHotline Miami, Papers, Please, Faster Than Light, Moon Hunters, Tooth and Tail, etc.  \\n\\nEven some newer, bigger releases are going in a route that isn't necessarily Movie Graphics - Cuphead is a hit and looks entirely like an old cartoon. Two of the most popular video games, including the ones most viewed on Twitch, are World of Warcraft and League of Legends - both of which look old and dated by today's standards. League looks like WarCraft 3 FFS. \\n\\nWhile it's true that AAA games always try to push for better graphics and that video games have been getting closer to providing a cinematic experience, smugly saying that ONLY those parts of video games are what people like about them is a bit off. \\nThe majority of your time on Mass Effect and Dragon Age: Inquisition is spent doing the same things you would do in games from 10-20 years ago: grinding enemies (enemies are still a thing in most video games), levelling up, resolving quests (quests are still a thing in most video games, also), trying not to bump into too many walls while figuring out how to access a certain place that might have a chest in it or something.\\nCinematic-style conversations and cutscenes are still a small part of the actual gameplay. In fact, the most popular, most viewed video games on Twitch aren't even ones that contain any kind of movie-style conversations between characters - they're multiplayer shooter games with zero dialogue. Overwatch, Playerunknown's Battlegrounds, Fortnite... And their graphics range from kinda like a game from 2008 to cutesy 3rd person League of Legends.",0,0

We follow and obey our Righteous King in our actions and deeds and the world hates us for it, because we don't form ourselves and obey the fallen king of this present world which is Satan):\\n\\n(Jesus):\\n\\nIf the world hates you,\\n\\nye know that\\nit hated me\\nbefore it hated you.\\n\\n(John 15:18).\\n\\n***(Hated Me): The world hated Him, so it should not be surprising that the world hates His followers.\\n\\n***(James 4:4)<---Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.\\n\\n***(1 John 2:15)<---Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in him.\\n\\n***(Luke 6:26)<---Woe unto you, when all men shall speak well of you! for so did their fathers to the false prophets.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Build your house with Jesus, on the rock, and you will never sink, that's (IF) we continue to Keep his Commandments, we will bear MUCH FRUIT!):\\n\\n(Jesus):\\n\\nAbide in me,\\nand I in you.\\n\\nAs the branch\\ncannot bear fruit of itself,\\nexcept it abide in the vine;\\n\\nno more can ye,\\nexcept ye abide in me.\\n\\n(John 15:4).\\n\\n***For the branch to produce more fruit, it must abide, which means to dwell, to stay, to settle in, to sink deeper. The way to abide in Christ is to OBEY.\\n\\n***(John 15:10)<---If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.\\n\\n***(1 John 3:24)<---And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.\\n\\n***The believer who lovingly OBEYS the Word of God produces much fruit.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Christ answers Philip, on himself and the Father as One. God manifested in the FLESH!):\\n\\nPhilip saith unto him, Lord,\\n\\nshew us the Father, \\nand it sufficeth us.\\n\\nJesus saith unto him,\\n\\nHave I been so long time with you, \\nand yet hast thou not known me, \\nPhilip?\\n\\nhe that hath seen me \\nhath seen the Father;\\n\\nand how sayest thou then, \\nShew us the Father?\\n\\nBelievest thou not that\\n\\nI am in the Father, \\nand the Father in me?\\n\\nthe words that I speak unto you \\nI speak not of myself:\\nbut (the Father)\\nthat (dwelleth) (in me),\\nhe doeth the works.\\n\\n(John 14:8-10).\\n\\n***(Revelation 21:3)<---And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the (tabernacle of God) is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and (God himself) shall be with them, and (be their God).\\n\\n***(Revelation 1:8)<---(Jesus)<----I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, (((the Almighty))).\\n\\n***The Lord rebuked Philip because he should have known the answer to the question he asked.\\n\\n***(He who has seen Me has seen the Father): The Lord patiently explained again that He was revealing God the Father to them in verse 7. It is impossible to escape the claim Jesus was making. Clearly, He was claiming to be God!\\n________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Jesus, The Great I AM!):\\n\\nJesus said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nBefore Abraham was, I AM.\\n\\nThen took they up stones to cast at him:\\nbut Jesus hid himself, \\nand went out of the temple,\\n\\ngoing through the midst of them, \\nand so passed by.\\n\\n(John 8:58-59).\\n\\n***(I AM): Jesus was not just claiming to have lived before Abraham; He was claiming eternal existence. He was claiming to be, God Himself.\\n\\n***(Exodus 3:14)<---And (God) said unto Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, (I AM) hath sent me unto you.\\n\\n***This time the Jewish leaders understood that Jesus was claiming to be God, so they took up stones to stone him for blasphemy. \\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(I AM):\\n\\n(Gk. ego emimi);\\n\\n*(John 6:35)<---And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me shall never hunger; and he that believeth on me shall never thirst).\\n*(John 10:7)<---Then said Jesus unto them again, Verily, verily, I say unto you, I am the door of the sheep).\\n*(John 10:14)<---I am the good shepherd, and know my sheep, and am known of mine).\\n*(John 15:1)<---I am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman).\\n*(John 18:5)<---They answered him, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus saith unto them, I am he. And Judas also, which betrayed him, stood with them).\\n\\n***Strong's #1473; 1510:\\nThis expression denotes self-identity in self-sufficiency. In one breath, Jesus asserted His eternal preexistence and His absolute deity. Abraham, as with all mortals, came into existence at one point in time. The Son of God, unlike all mortals, never has a beginning. He is eternal; and He is God.\\n\\nThis is evident in Jesus use of the words I AM for Himself. This statement recalls the Septuagint (The Greek OT) translation of Exodus 3:6 & 14, in which God unveiled His identity as the I AM WHO I AM. Thus Jesus was claiming to be the ever-existing, self-existent God.\\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\\n(Jesus claims equality with God in Power):\\n\\nThen answered Jesus \\nand said unto them,\\n\\nVerily, verily, I say unto you,\\nThe Son can do nothing of himself, \\n\\nbut what he seeth the Father do:\\nfor what things soever he doeth, \\n\\nthese also doeth the Son likewise.\\n\\n(The Son can do nothing of himself): Means that action by the Son apart from the Father is impossible because of the unity of the Father and the Son. (Whatever he does, the Son also does): Is a claim of deity and unity with the Father).\\n\\nFor the Father loveth the Son, \\nand sheweth him all things \\nthat himself doeth:\\n\\nand he will shew him \\ngreater works than these, \\nthat ye may marvel.\\n\\n(The son does what the Father does because the Father loves the son. Moreover, because the Father loves the Son, he reveals all to him. The Father would show the Son greater works than the healing of the sick man. Jesus would raised the dead and eventually judge humanity).\\n\\nFor as the Father raiseth up the dead, \\nand quickeneth them; \\neven so the Son quickeneth \\nwhom he will.\\n\\n(The Son gives life): As God raises people from the dead and gives them life, so Christ gives people spiritual life. Jesus claimed the same power as God, thus claiming that he is equal with God).\\n(John 5:19-21).",0,0

Later on, she's remembering when she was making her decision and he was pressuring her to have the abortion. It's why she says I don't want to do it and I don't know how to tell him and she has her hand on her stomach in the bed in an earlier scene. \\n\\nThe images of the kids are a life she could have had if she had packed up and left him.

PeUgWK0pUIA,"‚ÄúTurning‚Äù?...  I remember ranting about that when I saw Arkham Knight three years ago...  Ive been bitching about it every time a new game comes out that requires me to press a button and watch the game play itself.  I didnt feel like making a youtube video about it then because bitching about it wouldnt stop it.  Developers for almost a decade have been dumbing down games to make more money and cater to terrible scrub gamers, and now youre years late but so many people dont pay attention and have no idea so they think youve uncovered something...  Cool.  Have hundreds of thousands of views and likes and get paid for being years behind.  Cool, cool, cool, coolfmfnfkdmklbck.dswnjksw,jcgsj,ad c fg,cmn  afsjn",0,0

PeUgWK0pUIA,"I realize the people behind Cracked are casual gamers, if that, but even a cursory glance at Steam and some of the recent releases can defy that theory they put here. For several years now, Steam has become saturated with Retro-style games - mostly games using 2D graphics that look similar to the ones we've had back in the 80s and early 90s. \\nHotline Miami, Papers, Please, Faster Than Light, Moon Hunters, Tooth and Tail, etc.  \\n\\nEven some newer, bigger releases are going in a route that isn't necessarily Movie Graphics - Cuphead is a hit and looks entirely like an old cartoon. Two of the most popular video games, including the ones most viewed on Twitch, are World of Warcraft and League of Legends - both of which look old and dated by today's standards. League looks like WarCraft 3 FFS. \\n\\nWhile it's true that AAA games always try to push for better graphics and that video games have been getting closer to providing a cinematic experience, smugly saying that ONLY those parts of video games are what people like about them is a bit off. \\nThe majority of your time on Mass Effect and Dragon Age: Inquisition is spent doing the same things you would do in games from 10-20 years ago: grinding enemies (enemies are still a thing in most video games), levelling up, resolving quests (quests are still a thing in most video games, also), trying not to bump into too many walls while figuring out how to access a certain place that might have a chest in it or something.\\nCinematic-style conversations and cutscenes are still a small part of the actual gameplay. In fact, the most popular, most viewed video games on Twitch aren't even ones that contain any kind of movie-style conversations between characters - they're multiplayer shooter games with zero dialogue. Overwatch, Playerunknown's Battlegrounds, Fortnite... And their graphics range from kinda like a game from 2008 to cutesy 3rd person League of Legends.",0,0
PeUgWK0pUIA,"Honestly I have always thought Video Games, the big ones esp., are a level higher than movies in how immersive entertainment can be. Movies have visuals, sounds, and a story. But video games have that as well as being able to interact and even change the course of the story, in some games.",0,0
PeUgWK0pUIA,"Of course, then there's the Order 1886 which wanted to be a movie way more than it wanted to be a video game and pretty much everyone thinks that game was garbage.",0,0

PeUgWK0pUIA,"Based solely on the title of this video, I have to say that I think they should have put this out about thirteen years ago at the absolute latest. Seriously. Metal Gear Solid, StarFox, Ocarina of Time, BattleTanx, Hybrid Heaven...; these games all came out in the 1990s, and they were all basically interactive movies. By the time we entered the New Millennium, it was expected that a video game emulate movies, particularly with its cutscenes.",0,0

PeUgWK0pUIA,"Counter argument: I found Until Dawn to be boring despite the quality voice work and great graphics.  Quite simply, too much visual, not enough game play.  What about Halo 2?  The original graphics don't look that good, but the story was great and the game play was amazingly fun.  In other words, this video is wrong, and Cracked has once again shown that they are outsiders looking in rather than actual video game fans.
